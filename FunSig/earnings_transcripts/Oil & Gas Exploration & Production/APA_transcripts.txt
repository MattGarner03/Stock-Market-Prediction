===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-08 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the APA Corporation's First Quarter 2025 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Ben Rodgers, Senior Vice President of Finance and Treasurer. Please go ahead.
Ben Rodgers: Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's First Quarter 2025 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO, John Christmann. Steve Riney, President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Tracey Henderson, Executive Vice President of Exploration, is also on the call and available to answer questions. We will start with prepared remarks and allocate the remainder of time to Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss on today's call. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, I will provide an overview of our first quarter results, share an update on our cost reduction initiatives and provide details on how significant improvements in operating performance are allowing us to protect our free cash flow outlook despite the current commodity price volatility. We delivered strong first quarter results with in-line production and lower capital investment relative to guidance. In the Permian, oil production was within our guidance range despite a 1,000 barrel per day larger impact from third-party and weather-related downtime that was anticipated when we gave guidance. Capital came in below guidance largely due to significant improvements in drilling performance. In Egypt, we are highly encouraged by the prospectivity for natural gas. First quarter gas production exceeded guidance due to outperformance from our recent development program, along with continued efforts to optimize existing infrastructure. Despite shifting activity to gas, oil drilling is progressing well, and we continue to see positive results from our waterflood implementation programs, where we see additional running room with very favorable returns. In the North Sea, volumes were ahead of guidance, primarily driven by strong operational efficiency at Beryl. On the exploration front, we announced our second discovery, Sockeye-2, in the Brookian Play across our 325,000-acre footprint. The King Street-1 discovery in 2024 initially confirmed a working hydrocarbon system approximately 90 miles east of the Pikka development with high-quality pay in two separate hydrocarbon zones. Earlier this year, the Sockeye-2 well encountered 25 feet of net oil pay with an API oil gravity of approximately 28 degrees and a GOR of 720 across one consistent sand package, with seismic amplitude supporting the stratigraphic feature across 25,000 to 30,000 acres. We subsequently conducted a flow test that confirmed anticipated rock properties much better than regional analogs, including an average permeability of 100 to 125 millidarcies and a 20% porosity. Technical evaluation is underway to determine next steps for both the exploration and appraisal programs. I will turn now to our cost reduction initiatives, where we are making significant strides. Commensurate with our simplified portfolio, we are committed to sustainably reducing our controllable spend across capital, LOE and overhead. Our overall progress on these initiatives has been impressive, giving us the confidence to increase both our 2025 targets for realized savings to $130 million and the annualized run rate savings by the end of the year to $225 million. Of note, capital efficiencies are getting captured much faster than we expected. Permian drilling efficiencies are the largest driver of capital savings. We are also making good progress on both completions and facilities. Overall, our objective is to achieve top quartile operational performance in the Permian, and we are confident we're on track to deliver that. In Egypt, we are also seeing savings in drilling costs driven by continued refinement of our operating practices. Moving to LOE. In the Permian, while we continue pursuing near-term opportunities to reduce certain operating costs, we are experiencing upward pressure on other cost areas in the short term. Material savings will come from structural changes to how we operate, including such items as water handling, compression and power procurement. We see opportunities for substantial long-term reductions in these costs, but achieving them will require extended execution time frames. On the international front, we have lowered Egypt operating costs through efforts like accelerating diesel reduction projects and optimizing equipment rentals, and in the North Sea, rationalized offshore activity as we transition to late life operations. On the G&A front, we are accelerating the capture of cost reductions, which is also contributing to our increased savings targets for 2025. These savings not only come from streamlining our organization, but are also realized in multiple areas of discretionary third-party spend. This momentum is expected to continue through the year and is proving to be sustainable as we simplify how we manage our assets. As we continue to right size our organizational structure and work processes to better align with our current portfolio, we're further refining our operating model and leadership structure. Among other things, I would like to personally congratulate Ben Rodgers on being named Chief Financial Officer, effective next week. Many of you on the call have had the opportunity to interact with Ben over past few years, and I am eager to work more closely with him as the new head of our finance pillar with a continued focus on managing our cost structure. In the same spirit, I would like to thank Steve and acknowledge his invaluable contributions and thought leadership over financial and strategic matters through the years. I look forward to his continued contributions as he brings the same rigor and focus to our operations and development organizations, where his impact has already made a difference since his promotion to President last year. Before discussing our updated 2025 outlook, let me comment on the asset sale we announced in our press release yesterday. Subsequent to the first quarter, we signed an agreement to monetize our New Mexico Permian properties for $608 million. These assets, which contributed approximately 5,000 barrels per day of oil production during the first quarter, represent less than 5% of both our Permian oil production and unconventional acreage position. We intend to allocate most of the proceeds from this divestiture toward debt reduction. This sale fits with the continued streamlining of our portfolio and reflects a full exit from New Mexico, allowing us to focus solely on the Texas side of the basin. The transaction is expected to close late in the second quarter. In keeping with prior practice, our forward guidance at this time continues to include these assets and will be adjusted post-close. Turning now to our revised outlook for the remainder of the year. Let me start by emphasizing rapidly improving drilling efficiency we are seeing in the Permian. As we progress the integration of Callon, reduced activity to eight drilling rigs late last year to sustain flat oil volumes in the Permian. Given the confidence the operating efficiency gains, we can now hold oil volumes sustainably flat beyond 2025 with 6.5 rigs. Anticipating continual efficiency improvements, we are in the process of reducing to 6 rigs by the end of this quarter, and we'll reduce activity further if oil prices continue to deteriorate. We are also adjusting our frac fleets and completion schedule to better align with the lower rig count going forward. This will result in several wells for 2025 being turned in line later than originally planned, but we still expect to deliver oil volumes within our guidance range of 125,000 to 127,000 barrels per day. The combination of changes in completion timing and significant capital efficiency gains in the Permian is driving the bulk of our $150 million reduction in development capital guidance for the year. In Egypt, with the success of the gas program and the softness of oil prices, we have shifted rig activity to be approximately one-third gas focused. Our second quarter guidance contemplates continued growth to 470 million cubic feet per day gross gas volumes, and we anticipate ongoing strong performance in the second half of the year. Commensurate with this outlook, we expect our average realized gas price to continue to increase through the fourth quarter and into next year. This highlights how Egypt enhances the diversity of our portfolio and our capital allocation optionality. The new gas price agreement has brought gas-focused development into economic parity with oil drilling at mid-cycle Brent prices, making gas opportunities at today's oil strip more attractive on a relative basis. In addition, the production sharing contract in Egypt provides downside protection through the cost recovery mechanism, a natural hedge against lower Brent oil pricing. In closing, we are making substantial progress on our cost initiatives, particularly in Permian well costs and our overhead cost structure. This has allowed us to more than double our controllable spend savings targets for the year and reduce the capital intensity required to sustain longer-term production volumes. Together, these protect free cash flow in a volatile oil price environment. We will continue to balance the goals of sustaining and growing our business with returns to shareholders and further balance sheet strengthening. Our focus on cost reductions and capital efficiency for the near term will underpin free cash flow through 2027, ahead of Suriname first oil in 2028, which will significantly accelerate further growth. We believe that the result in free cash flow growth profile, coupled with our high-quality exploration portfolio, is differentiated from many of our peers and will drive growth in long-term shareholder value. And with that, I turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Riney: Thank you, John. I will begin my remarks with an overview of our first quarter results and then provide further commentary on our cost reduction initiatives and our updated plans for the rest of this year. For the first quarter, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA reported consolidated net income of $347 million or $0.96 per diluted common share. As usual, these results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which was a $111 million after-tax gain on the extinguishment of debt and a $76 million charge to increase our deferred tax liability in the UK due to the most recent increase in the energy profits levy. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the first quarter was $385 million or $1.06 per share. Let me start my comments on first quarter highlights with a couple of items from Egypt. I want to specifically recognize the significant progress that the Egyptian government has made towards normalizing our past due receivables. APA generated $126 million of free cash flow in the first quarter, but this does not include the progress we made on past due balances during the quarter, and that progress has now continued into the second quarter. Today, our past due balances in Egypt are the lowest they have been since the end of 2022. Also in Egypt, gas development is going very well, and increasing production volumes have led to an average realized gas price of $3.19 in the quarter, exceeding our guidance of $3.15. This is up from our fourth quarter average of $2.97. The combined benefit of substantial recent progress on payments and the new gas pricing agreement have been critical factors in a decision to maintain our planned activity levels in Egypt, albeit with a shift to more gas-focused drilling. First quarter upstream capital came in quite bit below guidance despite some accelerated spend in Suriname. This was a direct result of the outstanding operational results delivered by our Permian drilling teams, where drilling efficiencies have seen step change improvements compared to 2024. Let me now turn to progress on our cost reduction efforts. As a reminder, our efforts to rationalize our cost structure began almost a year ago, with a primary objective to drive sustainable cost savings for the long term. When we spoke about these initiatives on the February earnings call, we did not provide a breakdown of targeted savings between the various cost categories. We knew that overhead would be the largest initial contributor because that was the logical first target. However, we expected capital would be the largest contributor in the long term. Given the progress achieved through Permian drilling efficiencies, savings on capital will now provide the vast majority of our controllable spend reductions this year. Since the beginning of the year, we have captured an impressive $800,000 in cost savings per well in the Permian, and we still see additional room for improvement going forward. We have made significant improvements, including slim hole drilling, modifying casing stream designs, and utilizing fit-for-purpose directional tools that have considerably shortened our drilling durations. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we see additional improvements that are expected to drive further momentum into 2026. Completions and facilities costs also represent large reduction opportunities for us, and we are beginning to see progress As we continue to optimize economic resource recovery, a number of development patterns will shift toward a combination of denser well spacing per DSU with smaller fracs, leading to additional drilling cost savings due to fewer rig moves, as well as lower completion costs due to the smaller frac loading. On the facility side, through 2023 and 2024 and into 2025, we built a number of new facilities in areas where drilling activity was going to be growing. For the remainder of this year and into 2026, we will be much more dependent on brownfield modifications instead of new builds, resulting in additional capital savings relative to the recent past. On LOE, as John mentioned, our original targets contemplated an aggregate level of cost reduction that is proving challenging to achieve. While we are making good progress in some areas, we are also seeing some underlying pressure in others. This includes items like compression and water disposal, where we have experienced some inflationary pressures. As a result, we expect more meaningful progress on LOE savings will likely come later this year and beyond. Finally, on overhead costs, while our initial focus centered primarily on headcount rationalization, we are now also looking to streamline some of our more complex workflows. In particular, we are eliminating lower value activities, standardizing and simplifying routine work processes, expanding the use of more efficient technologies and broadening leadership spans of control. While some of these efforts will take more time to implement, we are progressing faster than previously anticipated, which is also contributing to our increased 2025 savings targets. Moving now to our outlook for this year. John touched on a number of topics related to our forward outlook, so I will comment on a few other items. The progress we have made on reducing controllable spending capital and overhead more than doubles our expected realized cost savings in 2025 despite increases in LOE. We've updated our guidance to reflect these changes while purposefully segregating activity reductions, deferrals and other items, excluding them from our accounting for savings on controllable spend. While these types of items will support free cash flow in 2025, we want to clearly distinguish sustainable reductions from timing-related differences for the year. Please refer to our supplement for further details. In Egypt, with over a third of this year's activity geared towards gas, we expect gross gas volumes to continue growing from first quarter levels. Despite some planned downtime due to plant maintenance, we expect gross gas volumes in the fourth quarter to be the highest of the year, and we anticipate exiting the year around 500 million cubic feet per day. Gas price realizations will steadily increase in line with this trajectory from approximately $3.40 in the second quarter to $3.80 in the fourth quarter, putting us at the upper end of our prior guidance of $3.40 to $3.50 per Mcf for the full year. Turning now to US gas marketing, a part of our business that has proven particularly profitable for us over the last few years. As a reminder, APA sells all Permian gas production in-basin and holds approximately 750 million Btus a day of firm capacity on various gas pipelines. Every day, we buy gas at Waha and transport that gas to the Gulf Coast, where it is sold at various price points. Based on current Waha differentials, this is a very profitable activity. Income generated from our firm capacity contracts, along with our LNG sales contract with Cheniere, are reflected in our guidance and financials as purchased oil and gas sales and costs. APA has entered into basis swap agreements for the second through fourth quarters of 2025 on roughly two-thirds of our firm transport capacity. Including actual profits in the first quarter, this locked in approximately $450 million of income for the year. Our 2025 guidance for income from third-party oil and gas marketing has been updated to $575 million, inclusive of these basis hedges. Lastly, I would like to quickly touch on some changes we have made to our upstream capital and free cash flow definitions around the treatment of ARO and leasehold acquisitions. Previously, cash ARO expense and leasehold acquisitions were included in our definition of upstream capital. Starting in 2025, we have removed both ARO and leasehold from upstream capital, and are now including these as individual line items in our reconciliation to free cash flow. Note that these changes have no impact on how we report free cash flow, and we have provided the new definitions, along with a reconciliation of the changes in our supplement. Please reach out to our IR team if you require any clarification. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be coming from John Freeman of Raymond James. John, your line is open.
John Freeman: Thanks. I wanted to dig in a little bit more to the cost savings that you all achieved already on the controllable spend. So the original guide that you all gave last quarter of getting down that $3.7 billion or $350 million run rate savings by the year-end '27. Given the fact that you've basically doubled what you thought you were going to achieve this year, do we just think of it as that original sort of time line you all showed last quarter, it just got pulled forward, but you're not necessarily increasing the absolute target, like the $350 million run rate savings by year-end '27 is being achieved quicker, but is there any thought of that number potentially moving higher?
John Christmann: Yes, John, you're exactly right. I mean at this point, we're way ahead of schedule. Obviously, now we've gone from 125 at year-end on a run rate basis to 225. So we're well on our way. I do anticipate that number will get raised at a later date. But today, that's -- we're going to leave that intact and keep working our away. The other thing of note is, if you look at in-year savings, we've gone from $60 million in-year to now $130 million in-year. So we're making really, really good progress. And I do anticipate at some point in the future, you'll see that 350 number go up. But today, we're going to leave it intact.
John Freeman: Understood. And then my follow-up question, in the Permian, where you've talked about being able to now go from what used to be eight rigs needed to hold US production flat, you can now do with six rigs -- I'm sorry, with 6.5 rigs. Would you all plan to go down to six rigs is -- do I think of it as that's slightly left in all -- you basically can't hold production flat at that level? Or do you think that at some point later this year, you're going to have additional efficiency gains and that 6.5 now becomes six to hold production flat? Just a little more color on that.
John Christmann: Yeah. That's exactly where we are. We came into the year with eight rigs. Today, we think we can hold the 125,000 to 127,000 barrels a day in the Permian flat with 6.5, but we're seeing signs of further efficiencies, which is why we're confident we can go ahead and drop two rigs and on down to six, which we believe we will hold it flat. And quite frankly, we think can do so well into 2026.
John Freeman: That's great. Thanks, John. Appreciate it.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will be coming from Doug Leggate of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, Doug.
Doug Leggate: Thank you guys. Sorry, John, to pound on this topic, the other John just asked about. But I'm just wondering, when we think about the pace of cost delivery that you're now -- especially the capital side of it. What had you originally assumed when gave us the 350 in terms of rig cadence? I guess, the $800,000 per well that you talked about, I mean, were those in your original 350 numbers, or is this a moving target? I'm trying to get a feel for who you're not willing to give us a new number today. What was embedded in that original target versus what you've done so far as quickly as you've done it?
John Christmann: Yeah. I mean I'd say we set aggressive targets, the 125 that we plan to capture by year-end, we set some aggressive targets, and you saw that in the LOE numbers. Obviously, the overhead was a piece. We said the capital was the biggest piece, but we thought that would come later and it's coming earlier. So we knew we could drive cost down. So I would say those savings were in that 350. But they're just coming faster. And we think there's more to do.
Doug Leggate: Okay. So my follow-up is, I wanted to take advantage of Tracey being on the call and ask her a question about Alaska. I know it's very early days, but you've got a couple of wells now that -- they're fairly well apart and some pretty good analogs if you look at Pikka flow rates from [indiscernible], when it was eventually tested, those wells, as I understand were fractured, yours was not. So can you offer any insight as to what you're thinking in terms of resource size? And if I can add a Part B, this is a bit of an obtuse one. I think there's a concern that, okay, here we go, we've got another major capital development that Apache has 50% of. How would you plan on funding it? Would you ever consider monetizing part of Suriname to fund Alaska?
John Christmann: Well, Doug, if you step back, we've got a 300, and I'll let Tracey chime in, in a couple of minutes, but we've got 325,000 acres estate lands. With the King Street discovery last year, it did two things. It proved we had high-quality reservoir sands, 90 miles east of Pikka. We went back to Sockeye this year, because we had the best seismic image over there. It is not the largest feature by any means, but it was the one we felt pretty confident would test geologic, geophysical model and as well as the whole acreage position. Obviously, it came in, but I'd say the surprise in there was the quality of the reservoir sands, which are actually better than expected. So it's a material discovery. It's high-quality oil, low GOR, 720, but it's one continuous package of sand, 20% porosity. But the big kicker in here is the permeability. It was 100 to 125 millidarcies, which is quite a bit better than the developments that are taking place. I think the thing you look at now, a big portion of our acreage -- we are in the process of reprocessing that seismic. And quite frankly, the largest prospect sits on the area we are reprocessing. So we're not going to be going at this hard on the capital side. We're going to be really smart about how we appraise and quite frankly, what we would drill next on the exploration side. But if you look at timing on your second Part B question, you look at timing on Suriname. You're going to have Suriname coming on well before you'd have meaningful capital spend here. So Tracey, you can jump in on the reservoir quality a little bit more about it geologically.
Tracey Henderson: Sure, John. Thanks. One of the things we're most encouraged by really is the reservoir quality, as John mentioned, and where we know we have something to work with. Our permeabilities are easily two times to four times better than analog fields to the west. And that's critical for how we go about developing fields. So our focus right now is on reprocessing the data, as John said, but also developing an appraisal strategy, which will include things like number of wells, development scenarios. You saw in the press release, the well flowed 2,700 barrels a day un-stimulated, and that was limited by tubulars. So we'll be looking at things like potential for waterflood, which is a possibility given the reservoir quality that we have, horizontal wells. Those will all be things that we need to think about and what development scenarios will look like. So we've got a lot to do to frame the path forward. And the appraisal program will be what will ultimately inform how we -- what we will come out with in terms of size of the resource here. And so we've got a lot of work to do, but we are very excited. One of the limiting factors that we have really is winter access, so we really need to be measured in how we plan our activities. And the work we're going to be focused on in the near term is going to be seismic reprocessing and looking at appraisal strategies. And we need to do that work, so we understand how we want to appraise and look at development scenarios going forward.
Doug Leggate: I'll give everyone a giggle here when I would think your partner, Bill Armstrong, has described the overlooked areas on the -- that booking plays the next Guyana. So we're watching with a lot of interest. We'll see. Anyway, thanks very much indeed guys. I appreciate the answers.
John Christmann: Thank you, Doug.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will be coming from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is open, Scott.
Scott Gruber: Yes. Good morning. I wanted to come back to the asset sale. As part of the motivation to sell the New Mexico position beyond the non-op aspect, there's been -- part of the motivation there where you're seeing across the rest of the Permian portfolio, it's been about a year since the Callon closed, you altered the development program there. So is that acreage surprising of the positive? Or are the drilling efficiencies making legacy acreage even more attractive? Maybe it's both? Just some color there.
John Christmann: Yes. If you step back on the New Mexico assets, what we had remaining in Mexico is good rock, but it's very small. It's less than 5% of our production. It's less than 5% of -- our acreage is scattered. Some of it was non-op for us. It was a package that we didn't have to sell, but we put in the market. It was highly contested. And so a lot of interest, and quite frankly, we felt like because of the price, it made sense to transact. We feel like we got full price. Obviously, Permian Resources is happy with it as well, but we think it's a good transaction especially for us, and the proceeds are going to predominantly go to debt paydown. Ben, anything you want to add?
Ben Rodgers: Yes. I'll just say we -- outside of the strategic reasons for getting out of New Mexico, you think about value here, and as John said, a very competitive process. And when you look at it a bunch of different valuation ways to look at it, but kind of in the mid- to high 5s on an EBITDA multiple, really good value for us. We'll use the proceeds to pay down debt and focus on the Texas side of the basin.
Steve Riney: Yes. I'd just add to that, that this is an area that really got sparing capital allocated to it for the last several years. And it's one that just didn't compete with the core other Permian Basin assets that we have in the Delaware and in the Southern Midland Basin for capital.
Scott Gruber: Yes. So I was curious whether the rest of the portfolio is getting better. And maybe turning to the LOE side of things. You mentioned the need to take some longer-term initiatives to address some of the inflation there in compression and water. Just some more color on those initiatives, whether there's CapEx associated and what kind of time line should we think about to see the benefit?
Steve Riney: Yes. If I could just maybe step back a bit on Permian LOE. We -- coming into the year, we set a plan that perhaps was a bit ambitious with some embedded savings already built into it. And those are materializing a little bit slower than we had hoped. And -- in addition to that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are seeing some inflationary pressures, too, and compression costs and water disposal in particular, ones where we're seeing those. And so we're going to get there on LOE in the Permian. It might take a little bit longer. We're looking at all options that -- some might involve some capital investment, some probably did not. Some of them might be just commercial negotiations and getting after the embedded cost structure, both in our assets historical and in the Callon assets as well. But we certainly believe at this point, just like G&A and the CapEx, it's going to be -- LOE is going to be a meaningful part of the $350 million of cost savings that we've targeted for the next three years. We're just going to take a little bit more time to get there. We'll be getting there later this year and into 2026.
Scott Gruber: Got it. Appreciate the color. Thank you.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question will be coming from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan Securities. Your line is open.
Arun Jayaram: Yes. Good morning. I wanted to go through your plans to kind of evolve or migrate your completion design in the Permian. I know when you guys announced the Callon merger, John, Steve, one of the first steps that you did was to maybe relax spacing in your DSUs. So I wanted to see if you could elaborate on maybe the decision to move to tighter spacing. Is this in the Delaware? And maybe just give us some thoughts around that decision?
John Christmann: I think, Arun, it's just overall in the basin. I mean we did relax spacing with the wider spacing and larger fracs on the Callon side. I would say over time, though, as we look in areas, we're starting to move more a little tighter spacing with smaller fracs and areas. So I think it's more of the of the evolution basin. And as we look at it today, a lot of the areas where we're focusing our capital, we are drilling on tighter spacing than what we have historically. And with the well cost coming down and smaller fracs, we can more efficiently develop the resource. But I'll let Steve jump in on a few points as well.
Steve Riney: Yes. This is the type of thing that comes up every time we get questions associated with our Permian inventory. And we haven't come to the market for quite some time with a transparent view and a thorough view of our inventory in the Permian, and we are working on that. We've talked about that in the past. We're deep in the process of characterizing everything that we've gotten with the Callon acquisition. We're also characterizing some remaining legacy Apache inventory that we haven't gotten to yet. And all of that inventory, the quantum of inventory is increasing with what we're planning to do on the density side. And that is actually turning out now to be a bit of shooting at a moving target on the density side because every time we get cost reductions, it naturally will increase the density, the economic density of drilling in the Permian. And every time you increase the density of the wells, you're increasing not just the well count in the in the drilling unit, but also the EUR drilling unit. And so the more you drive down costs, what we've achieved on the $800,000 per well in the first quarter of this year, the more you do that, the more you're going back and saying, well, this further increases the density possibility of drilling in the Permian. And that's what we're looking at. And we will -- what we've said in the past and we will do this, we will come out probably later this year or early next year with a more thorough view of all of our inventory. But just recognize for everybody is that -- that is a moving target as you drive costs down, things that were uneconomic or marginally economic before become economic in that process.
Arun Jayaram: Great. I know investors would welcome that type of analysis, Steve, so look forward to that. Maybe one for Ben. It looks like the proceeds from the New Mexico asset sale will be targeted towards debt reduction. So maybe looking for some color, Ben, how you think about repurchasing debt? I think some of your debt is trading at 25% discount to par. But you obviously have some other items such as repaying the term loan or taking out debt as it matures. So where is your head at in terms of using asset sales proceeds in terms of the debt stack?
Ben Rodgers: Sure. No. So we paid off Callon term loan in the first quarter with a mix of cash we had on hand and some revolver borrowings. So the revolver balance that you see at the end of the quarter, which was a mix of revolver borrowings and commercial paper was a result of fully paying off the Callon term loans. So that's good, had some interest expense savings on that. When we look really for the rest of the year and through our maturity profile through 2030, that's where a lot of our focus is going to be. We do recognize that there's some debt that's trading below par, and that's inclusive of that time period, even between now and end of 2030. And so we'll with -- pay down the revolver and have a bunch of liquidity, we've got a lot of different options that we can look at. We think of it in a lot of different ways. One way is on a yield basis. So to your point, with those bonds trading below par, that yield is higher than the cost of us to borrow on the revolver. So we'll be opportunistic as we go through the year and have a lot of tools because of the liquidity pickup from paying down the revolver.
Arun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And our next question will be coming from Betty Jiang of Barclays. Your line is open, Betty.
Betty Jiang: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I think it will be really helpful to get some color reconciling, back on the cost optimization, the $130 million average saving for the year to the $225 million run rate expected for year-end 2025. What's driving that increase in run rate over the course of the year? So specifically, I'm wondering, if you're already seeing a $0.8 million saving on the Permian well cost to date, are you assuming that's going to double from here?
Ben Rodgers: Yeah. So good question, Betty. We increased the 60 realized this year by $70 million to capture $130 million. To get to the run rate to the $225 million, that's just expecting that as we get into 2026, a lot of the capital savings that we have by running just six rigs and additional progress we'll make on overhead. And then to Steve's point, on the LOE side, we'll make some progress on LOE this year, but really expect a lot of that to come in 2026 and 2027. And so that's what's implied in that run rate of $225 million is that a continued acceleration of capturing those cost savings, again, by reduced activity in the Permian while still holding production flat and then continuing to capture savings with overhead and pickup in LOE.
Steve Riney: The $800,000 of savings per well is delivering the majority of that increase to $225,000 run rate at the end of the year.
John Christmann: And the other factor is -- back half of the year, anything we capture now will be full year for 2026. And so the captured in year number now going from 60 to 130, you're actually at a higher run rate on an annualized basis going forward. And so it's really what's captured inside this year versus what the run rate on the overall program will be going into next year.
Betty Jiang: Got it. That's helpful. It seems like it's more driven by the overhead and LOE. Maybe my follow-up is just on the LOE front. Could you give some specific example on what you're expecting to see on the LOE side to offset the inflationary pressure that you have seen to date?
Steve Riney: Yeah, there are going to be a lot of things that we're going to be looking at, everywhere from the basic day-to-day route optimizations of pumpers, all the way to the contracting of produced water disposal and compression we have contracts for things like that that come due throughout the year and throughout the years. And every time one of those comes available, you have the opportunity to renegotiate. So a lot of this stuff is going to be internally focused on how we work, work operating practices, how we work out in the field, how we manage day-to-day activity and then other aspects of it will be externally focused negotiating with vendors, everything from chemicals to all other forms of services.
Betty Jiang: Great. Appreciate the color.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will be coming from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Your line is open, Paul.
Paul Cheng: Hey, guys. Good morning.
John Christmann: Good morning, Paul.
Paul Cheng: John, wondering that, I mean, you're saying that why now in Egypt, the gas development is actually very attractive or comparable to the oil. And so should we assume that you have oil price line further from here that you will be making -- you're going to shift more of the rig the gas? On the other hand, your oil price rise above the current level, you're going to ship back more into oil? And also that for Alpine High, what kind of gas/oil ratio will make you saying that -- I mean, now that we will be able to move some of the capital back to Alpine High? That's the first question.
John Christmann: Paul, I mean, if you look at Egypt, we came into the year running one rig. Obviously, we've been ratcheting that up as Brent crude oil has softened. So it puts us in a nice position. And we've also had capacity in the infrastructure to be able to add shift. And as we said, we should see volumes north of 500 by year-end. So it does give us optionality in Egypt, but you have to work kind of within the constraints of what we have in terms of facilities and inventory. And the oil still works nicely because of the cost recovery mechanisms in the PSC in Egypt. But those are at par kind of a mid-cycle Brent prices. So with crude softening, definitely a tilt to the gas side in Egypt. And I'll let Steve comment on the US gas.
Steve Riney: Well, and I would just add on Egypt. On the oil side, there's been some concern expressed that while shifting more towards gas means less oil production, actually, most of the gas in the Western Desert of Egypt is very rich gas and comes with a lot of condensate. So we've been on what we've called a slight decline in oil -- gross oil volumes in Egypt and between the condensate that's coming with the gas program and also the improvements coming from waterflood programs in stemming base decline, I would still characterize oil volume decline as being on a very slight decline. And it's on the -- as we look at the outlook for gross oil volume in Egypt, I would say it's on the slightest of declines as we go through second through fourth quarters.
Paul Cheng: Steve, on Alpine High, can I ask that on -- in Egypt, I think for oil, you sort of like need to workover rig for one drilling rig. In the gas side, is this still a similar ratio? Or that -- yes, I'm less? Because I think part of the issue last year or the last couple of years is that you don't have -- you can't find enough of the workover rig there for you to increase the drilling rate?
Steve Riney: Yes. We're still running a similar number of workover rigs today as we were before. But you got to remember on the gas side, part of the gas comes from [indiscernible], and part of it is associated gas with the oil wells -- oil production. And all of this incremental new gas that's coming on, I certainly hope we're not going to be spending a lot of time and effort and money on workovers on those wells. These are brand-new wells, should be producing for quite some time. And typically, maintenance on gas wells tends to be a little less intensive than on oil wells. On Alpine High, Alpine High is -- obviously a lot of gas there and very economic gas at certain types of prices. But we run economics on Alpine High and decide whether we're going to drill there or not based on Waha pricing because the transport activity is completely separate from that, and we purchase gas and sell it on the Gulf Coast. And so the money that we make on the gas trading, what we call gas trading, is completely independent of Alpine High. Alpine High has to stand economically, and drilling in Alpine High has to stand economically on Waha pricing and a perceived forward view of Waha pricing. Obviously, with pipelines being built, the occasional pipeline maintenance shutdown, things like that, Waha is still extremely volatile right now. And we've seen -- even this year, we've seen Waha pricing to a point where we have actually curtailed volumes, and we thought that that would not be the case coming into this year. With all of that, when we're at a position where we believe Waha pricing is adequate to support economic drilling in Alpine High that is as good or better than drilling for oil in the Permian Basin, then we'll shift the rig from oil-focused drilling to gas-focused drilling, or we'll add another rig for Alpine High, one or the other.
Paul Cheng: I see. A final -- a second one, hopefully, real quick. John, at what oil price that you would say the [indiscernible] is here or we are in the red mine and so you would take a more drastic cut in the capital program as well as allow the oil production to drop from -- trying to hold it flat? Is there a number that you have in mind?
John Christmann: Obviously, we'll keep an eye on things, and we've set ourselves up when we're positioned if need be to respond. But I think you'd have to see WTI get down into the very low 50s at this point. And obviously, the first step would likely be dropping a couple of rigs in the Permian and a frac crew. Maybe in Egypt, but we're -- we'll watch things, and we're in a really, really good place right now. And quite frankly, with the activity set that's running and the progress we're making on the cost structure, that number is going lower every day.
Paul Cheng: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Leo Mariani of ROTH. Your line is open Leo.
Leo Mariani: Hi. I wanted to just touch base on the buyback here. Obviously, oil prices have softened quite a bit. You did significant buyback, $100 million or so in the first quarter. Just kind of at that $60 level, do you guys see the buyback being a little bit more limited with more focus on debt paydown? You obviously elected to sell an asset in this market. It seemed like you certainly wanted to deliver on some debt paydown goals this year in light of the weaker macro. So can you just talk about how the buyback kind of plays into your thinking at this oil price or even a little lower?
John Christmann : Yes, I'll let Ben jump in just a second. But in general, Leo, we sold the asset because we were opportunistic on the price. I mean it wasn't something that we felt like we had to do, but we put it in the market and got numbers that we thought were fantastic, and so we transacted. We're in the process of transacting. It does let us take the revolver down, and Ben can talk about those, but I think it puts us in a position where we can also still be very opportunistic if -- on the buyback if need be.
Ben Rodgers: Yes, just a quick follow-up. We set the 60% return to shareholders within our framework. We've exceeded that every year. And so -- as we go through the year, as John said, we'll have -- we'll be opportunistic around that. And with our zero revolver balance, we'll look at both the debt side and being opportunistic on the equity side as well.
Leo Mariani: Okay. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on Egypt oil volumes. Steve, you basically said it's going to be a very, very slight decline there on gross oil volumes, if I heard you right. Certainly, just looking at first quarter, they were down, I would say, a little bit more than kind of slight decline. Maybe there were some timing issues or sort of an anomaly there. But I'm just trying to kind of get a sense, should those gross volumes continue to decline off of 1Q levels? Or is there maybe something anomalous there in 1Q?
Steve Riney : There was a bit of unexpected downtime in 1Q, but I think that you can expect continued slight decline through the quarters on gross oil.
Leo Mariani: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will be coming from Oliver Huang of TPH & Company. Oliver, your line is open.
Oliver Huang: Good morning, John and team. And thanks for taking the questions.
John Christmann: Hi, Oliver.
Oliver Huang: For my first question, I just wanted to ask about breakevens. As we think about the revised program with some of the cost outs from the savings initiatives you all have accelerated, what sort of oil price are you all now looking at in terms of covering your CapEx and base dividend with internally generated free cash flow?
John Christmann: Yes. Oliver, if you look at where we sit today and when you factor in the savings we've got planned at the 350 annual run rate, we can fund Ceron, the exploration program, the DCOM, run 6 rigs in the rigs in the Permian, 12 Egypt and still pay dividend at $50 WTI with very reasonable assumptions on the marketing side. So making really, really good progress. And those are -- we're funding some programs that actually are going to provide longer-term growth.
Oliver Huang: Makes sense. Thanks for that response. And I just had a follow-up question to Arun's earlier question. Just really trying to better understand the progression of the denser well space -- well spacings you all talked about in the prepared remarks. I understand there are many variables, as Steve mentioned earlier, with shooting at a moving target analog. But just -- is there any way to quantify how this is transitioning from, say, 2024 to 2025 and how this might look going forward into 2026 or if there's a better way just kind of understand what percentage of the program this year is seeing that denser spacing design?
John Christmann: Yes. I mean, if you look today, a great percentage of it is. And part of it is we did a lot of work last year, and then we prepurchased a lot of our tubulars and materials and things. And we're running with slimmer casing. And so you've got to set these programs up and let them run a little bit, but we're -- it moved a lot of the program in a lot of the areas we're drilling, and seeing really, really good results. And so we'll continue to tweak that. But it's a dynamic process, and we're going to continue to look to optimize as we go forward. But a greater percentage, especially in the areas where we're focused right now, you're seeing a little tighter spacing than what we've done historically and also some smaller fracs.
Oliver Huang: Perfect. Thanks for the time guys.
Operator: And I'm showing -- and I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to John Christmann, CEO, for closing remarks.
John Christmann: Yes. Thank you. In closing, let me leave you with the following thoughts. We are making significant strides in drilling efficiencies in the Permian, and we are on track to deliver our full year production volumes at a lower capital budget. We have reduced average well cost by $800,000 per well from the 2024 levels, and this is on top of the $1 million savings we had achieved on the Callon properties. And we believe these cost savings to be structural and sustainable. In Egypt, we are very encouraged with strong performance from the gas program, where we are shifting an increasing proportion of the activity for this year. We have visibility to increasing average gas realizations in line with this outlook, with fourth quarter expected to average $3.80 per Mcf. Finally, our overhead cost reductions are proceeding ahead of schedule, and we are well on the way to delivering our targets for 2025 and beyond. This will sustainably improve our cost structure and long-term free cash flow generation. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-27 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the APA Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial and Operational Results. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during this session, you'll need to press star one one on your telephone. If your question has been answered and you'd like to remove yourself being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Ben Rogers, Senior Vice President of Finance and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. 
Ben Rogers: Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's fourth quarter and year-end 2024 financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO, John Christmann. Steve Riney, President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Tracy Henderson, Executive Vice President of Exploration and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations. Our prepared remarks will be about twenty minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our investor relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss on today's call. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call today, I will review our 2024 accomplishments, share highlights of our fourth quarter performance, and provide an overview of our 2025 plan and other key long-term objectives. Over the last several years, APA has been strategically reshaped in numerous ways. We have enhanced the quality and sustainability of the portfolio in our core areas of the Permian Basin and the western desert of Egypt, while also building long-term optionality through a differentiated exploration strategy. Throughout this process, we have been strengthening the balance sheet and prudently allocating capital to prioritize returns. 2024 was a year of notable further progress on all of these fronts. In the Permian, we continued to strategically refine our position with the acquisition of Cowen and the sale of non-core assets. In Egypt, we signed a new gas price agreement creating the potential for significant additional drilling opportunities with returns on par with oil. In Suriname, we reached a final investment decision for our first oil development. Lastly, we achieved a BBB- rating from S&P and are now investment grade with all three rating agencies. With the significant portfolio changes in the Permian Basin during 2024, our US business is now almost entirely comprised of unconventional. This strategic shift has solidified the Permian as the cornerstone of our asset base, driving over 75% of our current adjusted production and providing a more predictable and steady business model. As seen in our supplement released yesterday, APA's scale in the Permian now stands out, rivaling and surpassing many of our US independent shale peers. In Egypt, we succeeded while also improving our PDP decline through water flood activities. These efforts have provided a much more predictable oil production profile, increasing the overall efficiency and longevity of our operations. In Suriname, we reached a significant milestone when our partner Total announced FID on the Grand Morgue project, with a capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day, and first oil expected in 2028. As you will recall, based on the joint venture agreement we have with Total, our capital spending exposure for the project will be very manageable. 2024 also highlighted the value of our gas trading activities, where we realized an annual net gain of nearly half a billion dollars. At current strip prices, we believe 2025 will be a similarly strong year. Lastly, we continue to deliver on our capital return framework. In 2024, we returned 71% of free cash flow through $353 million in dividends and $246 million in share repurchases. This includes $100 million of repurchases executed during the fourth quarter at a price just under $22 per share. We continue to believe our shares offer a compelling value and we will be inclined to lean into the buyback program at such prices. Moving now to a few highlights from the fourth quarter. We delivered production volumes above guidance in all three of our operating regions and did so on a capital program that came in lower than guidance, primarily due to ongoing well cost reductions in the Permian Basin. These factors were the main drivers in delivering $420 million of free cash flow during the quarter. In November, we added a rig in Egypt to initiate a gas-focused drilling program. We are very pleased with the early results and now expect year-over-year gas production to increase for the first time in over a decade. Finally, on December 31st, we closed on the sale of our non-core conventional properties in the Permian Basin. Let me now turn to the progress we have made with Callan. We acquired Cowen primarily to add scale and inventory to our existing portfolio. We also anticipated capturing meaningful synergies, most of which we achieved on a sustainable basis by the end of 2024. As we took over operations, our focus was on addressing the capital and operating efficiencies required to deliver industry-competitive returns. By increasing lateral length while reducing total well cost, we were able to lower breakeven oil prices in 2024 to $61 per barrel compared to Cowen's 2023 breakeven of $78 per barrel. We are looking forward to further improvements in 2025 and beyond. In the Midland Basin, in Northern Howard County, our early results have significantly outperformed expectations. We plan to return to this area with tighter well spacing on future pads, which will increase inventory counts and capture more resources than we originally anticipated. This has a positive read-through to offset legacy APA Rich as well, and we will revisit these opportunities in the future. Moving on to our 2025 plan. Our 2024 achievements helped lay the foundation for an efficient activity set and more predictable production profile in 2025 and beyond. We expect to run an eight-rig program in the Permian and a twelve-rig program in Egypt. This activity set results in a combined development capital budget of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion and reflects more than a 20% year-over-year reduction in development capital in the Permian when adjusting for Cowen's first quarter 2024 spend. Adding $200 million for Suriname development, and $100 million for exploration capital, primarily in Alaska, we expect our total capital budget to be $2.5 to $2.6 billion. With this lower development capital budget, we expect to deliver higher total adjusted production in 2025 compared to 2024. While this includes the benefit of no planned gas curtailments, it also underscores the progress we are making on capital efficiency through the integration of Cowen and the stabilization of Egypt volumes. Lastly, I want to touch on the cost reduction initiatives we announced in our earnings release yesterday. In the fourth quarter, we launched an effort to analyze cost-saving opportunities across three core areas that drive the majority of our annual controllable spend: capital, LOE, and overhead. We are focused on identifying opportunities to streamline the business, improve the way we operate, and control our costs. The first step in simplifying the organization was announced in January when we reduced our corporate officer count by over one-third. Earlier this month, we initiated additional overhead decreases as part of a broader streamlining effort across the organization. These initial reductions, coupled with the targeted savings in capital, LOE, and additional overhead spend, are expected to generate at least $350 million in annualized savings by year-end 2027. These efforts will drive free cash flow expansion over the next several years. In closing, APA made significant continued progress in 2024 to streamline our portfolio and establish a core asset base that can underpin a sustainable activity set and predictable production profile from the Permian and Egypt for the long term. In the short to medium term, we will work to reduce our controllable spend. This is our path to meaningful free cash flow growth in the 2025 to 2027 time frame, ahead of Suriname First Oil in 2028, which will underpin a further step change in free cash flow into the next decade. We believe that this cash flow growth profile, coupled with our high-quality exploration portfolio, is differentiated from many of our peers and will drive growth in long-term shareholder value. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Riney: Thank you, John. For the fourth quarter, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA reported consolidated net income of $354 million or $0.96 per diluted common share. As usual, these results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which was a $224 million US deferred tax benefit related to the write-off of APA's investment in our UK subsidiaries and a $190 million increase in our net liability on the former Fieldwood properties. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $290 million or $0.79 per share. Fourth quarter DD&A expense was higher than guidance primarily due to accelerated depreciation at Alpine High, with negative Waha gas prices for the second and third quarters of 2024, SEC reserve guidelines required that substantially all of the Alpine High reserves be written off. As a result, one-third of the Alpine High carrying value was depreciated in the fourth quarter, and there will be a similar impact in the first quarter of 2025. Fourth quarter lease operating expense also came in slightly higher than guidance largely due to an extra North Sea cargo lifting in the quarter. The timing of North Sea cargo liftings has no impact on reported production, but it does affect the recognition of both sales revenue and LOE. APA generated $420 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, the highest of any quarter in 2024. Through dividends and share repurchases, we returned 46% of this amount to shareholders in the quarter. For the full year, we generated $841 million in free cash flow, of which we returned 71% to shareholders. Please refer to APA's published definition of free cash flow for any reconciliation needs. In 2024, we made significant progress in strengthening our balance sheet and are close to returning to pre-calendar debt levels only nine months after closing the acquisition. Recognizing the lower net debt levels and increased scale achieved last year, S&P upgraded our credit rating to BBB- in October. Our ultimate objective is to achieve BBB or better ratings, one notch above our current ratings at all three rating agencies. Wrapping up commentary on 2024, let me address the $190 million increase in the net contingent liability for the Fieldwood properties. This increase does not reflect any change in the anticipated cost to plug and abandon wells or to remove facilities and seafloor infrastructure. In 2021, as a result of the Fieldwood bankruptcy ruling, an independent third party was required to own and manage the assets. In this capacity, the third party operates the producing assets and maintains and monitors the non-producing assets awaiting abandonment. We believe the third party's cash cost for these activities remains too high. Until we take actions to directly reduce these costs, the resultant reduction in future net cash flows increases the contingent liability on our balance sheet. With a large portion of the security utilized, we are now free to explore all avenues to manage these assets and to enable a more prudent cost management system. We expect resolution to this later this year. Turning to our 2025 outlook, let me provide a few more details with respect to our guidance for the year. Starting with our capital spending cadence, you should expect our spending to be front-half weighted primarily due to the timing of Suriname capital calls and our exploration activities in Alaska. Despite a planned steady activity level, the Permian is also first-half weighted, primarily due to the timing of facility spend in the basin. Looking at production, 2024 oil volumes for the US, adjusted for the effects of asset sales and the first quarter Cowen production, were 128,000 barrels of oil per day. With the eight-rig program planned in the Permian for 2025, US oil volumes should be in the 125,000 to 127,000 barrels per day range. Total US volumes should increase mid-single digits as we do not anticipate any price-related production curtailments this year. In Egypt, adjusted production is expected to grow slightly year over year, with a modest decline in gross volumes. On the gas front, we initiated drilling activity in the fourth quarter and have seen very encouraging results. As John indicated, we now expect gross gas production to grow year over year. Our average realized gas price is expected to increase from $2.96 per Mcf in the fourth quarter to at least $3.15 per Mcf in the first quarter. The average realized price will continue to grow through the year, with the full-year average expected in the $3.40 to $3.50 range. As we look beyond 2025, success in the gas program will determine our ability to continue growing gas production and will highlight any need for additional infrastructure investment. Moving to lease operating expense, for the US, we expect operated LOE per BOE in the Permian to be about 20% lower than 2024. This step change in operating efficiency reflects the progress we have made streamlining our US portfolio and harvesting synergies from the acquisition of Cowen. The return of curtailed gas volumes also contributes to the improvement in our per-unit LOE. In terms of our guidance related to G&A, it may appear that overhead costs are increasing significantly in 2025. Total overhead costs are, in fact, going down, but it is difficult to see that comparing 2024 actual G&A expense to 2025 guidance. Recall that overhead costs are allocated to multiple areas, including investment, exploration, LOE, and G&A. The relationship between G&A expense and total overhead costs is impacted most significantly by allocation methodology and the mark-to-market impact for long-term incentive compensation. These items are causing G&A expense to increase despite our plans to decrease overhead costs by at least $25 million in 2025. 2024 was a strong year for our third-party gas trading business, and 2025 is shaping up to perform at a similar level. This year, the Waha basis spread remains advantageous, and we have seen appreciation in international LNG prices benefiting APA through our Cheniere gas supply contract. Given current strip prices, we anticipate generating a combined net gain of $600 million for 2025. Lastly, I would like to end with some additional color around our cost reduction initiatives. We are targeting $350 million in annualized cost savings by the end of 2027. Our goal is not just to capture some quick-hit opportunities to lower costs, although that is certainly a near-term focus. Our goal is to right-size our entire cost structure to achieve a long-term, purposeful, and sustainable outcome. In the near term, this will naturally focus on efforts which are simply a matter of choice and discretion. Much of this is in our overhead cost structure and in day-to-day field operating practices. In the intermediate term, it will address our capital cost structure, things like drilling and completions, and facilities, as well as operating practices such as life-of-field resource management and field automation. For the longer term, it will address more deeply ingrained structures like IT systems and infrastructure and accounting applications and procedures. This is why we have set longer-term targets out to 2027. Some of these things are happening quickly, and others will take more time and effort. In 2025, our objective is to achieve run-rate savings of $100 to $125 million by the end of this year. At this point, we anticipate an in-year capture of around $60 million of actual savings, which is something we hope to improve upon as we go through the year. Our cost reduction targets are an important effort for the entire organization and are therefore included in both our short-term and long-term incentive compensation programs. Already this year, we have made good progress on restructuring our organization, starting with the reduction in our officer count that John mentioned. This was followed by a greater than 10% reduction in our global overhead structure in February. The combined annual run-rate savings with these two simplification steps is approximately $35 million per year of salaries and benefits. In closing, the ongoing enhancement in the quality and sustainability of our core portfolio, combined with the right-sizing of our cost structure, will lay a foundation for growing free cash flow over the next three years. Suriname First Oil in 2028 will then carry that free cash flow growth into the next decade. Over that same time period, free cash flow per share increases even more significantly as a result of the share buybacks built into our capital returns framework. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Certainly. And ladies and gentlemen, we'd ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. You may get back in the queue as time allows. And one moment for our first question. Our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggett from Wolfe Research. Your question please.
Doug Leggett: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. John and Steve, I think, looking at your share performance, whether we take 2025 year to date, 2024, or 2023, something's clearly not clicking in terms of, you know, the $420 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, the $600 million of gas trading, the cost-cutting, it all adds up to big numbers, but yet your share price continues to frankly get decimated relative to your peer group. It seems to us at least that there's a crisis of confidence in the guidance that is persistently getting missed. And I'd like to ask you what confidence do you have through these cost-cutting measures that control over your guidance and visibility is gonna get better?
John Christmann: Doug, I appreciate you jumping on. Appreciate the question. I think if you, you know, you back, number one, you know, if you look at what we're doing on the cost structure side and you look at the portfolio, over the last several years, we've really transformed our two anchor assets, Permian and Egypt, into two businesses that we believe now have sustainable and durable inventory and future with them. Right? So and if you look back over the last seven, eight quarters, we've actually done pretty well on hitting targets on the guidance. As far as the cost reductions, you know, you go back to the middle of last year, we're always focused on the cost structure and what can we do to generate more free cash. Now that we've got two businesses that, quite frankly, we don't feel like you need to grow with Suriname now coming on in 2028. We started looking at how do we moderate and put some sustainability and predictability in those, which is why you saw us ratchet the capital down in the back half of the year. We've now got programs in Egypt with twelve rigs in Permian with eight that we feel like we can deliver. And it's all about cost structure. And so we started stepping back and looking at that hard and took a very deliberate starting at the top of the organization. I think we've laid out $350 million over the next three years. We're getting after it. We've already got $35 million of it kind of already identified and captured. And so I feel really confident that we set meaningful targets we will deliver. I think we've got the asset base in a place today where it will also deliver.
Doug Leggett: No. I know it's a tricky one to answer, Jamal. We're all gonna have to watch what happens. But my follow-on is and, you know, you and I and Steve have talked about this often, but if I could kinda replay back to you a couple of things you said in your opening remarks about believing your stock is compelling value. You're gonna return 60% of your free cash flow to shareholders. Your yield is almost 5%. Your capital structure is getting close to 45% debt. I don't really care too much about what the rating agencies say about it. Your equity holders are, you know, there was left after net debt. Why are you continuing to prioritize share buybacks when you can easily confirm transfer value from debt to equity by paying down your debt because you've been buying back shares for three years. Your share price is down 57%.
John Christmann: Yeah. I would say, Doug, we've also, I mean, you look at the returns framework, we've also been buying back debt. And I think we've made meaningful progress on both fronts. And I think with the framework that we have in place today, you know, we will make progress on both fronts, both on the share side and the debt side.
Steve Riney: Yeah. I Doug, I'd just say the same thing. We're working both sides of that. And, you know, you have a forty dollar price target on us, and you know, with that kind of potential appreciation, buying back shares is leveraging to our current shareholder base and a number of our shareholder base actually support the buyback pretty heavily.
Doug Leggett: Yeah. I gotta defend myself very quickly. Let me just say one thing, and that assumes a normalized discount rate, Steve. Which you're not gonna get with this capital structure given the volatility in your business. So if you don't fix the capital structure, your discount rate is not gonna normalize. That's kinda the thesis, but I'll leave it there. I appreciate you answering the questions. I know it's not easy, but thanks for your time. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your question please.
Charles Meade: Good morning, John and Steve and the rest of the APA team there.
John Christmann: Good morning, Charles.
Charles Meade: John, I wanna ask a couple of questions about what's going on with the asset base. And I guess the first one would be, can you give us an update on what's going on in Alaska, specifically with the Sockeye exploration well, where you are on the progress, what you've seen, and particularly how that, you know, kind of, I guess, interacts or or or have it in reference to the to the activity you guys did in the last drilling season?
John Christmann: Yeah. What I would say, Charles, is think the big difference is the operations are going extremely well and going very smoothly. You know, we are not in a position yet to comment on anything as we're not into the pay zones yet, but I can tell you things are on track. And, you know, things are going extremely well operationally, and has been very smooth from that standpoint. So, you know, obviously, we're anxious to see the results and, you know, they'll be forthcoming. So, far, so good.
Charles Meade: Got it. So just stay tuned there. And then John, going back to some of your prepared comments about the Permian specifically Howard County, I think you said that you guys have seen you're seeing better productivity in some zones and you're looking at some future downspacing. My understanding of Howard County, you know, of course, it varies as you go from West to East, but that's the zones you have are good, but there's not as much, you know, stacked potential up and down the column. And in general, the spacing needs to be wider in Howard to get the same kind of EURs. But wonder if you could talk about what you know, where in Howard County, what more specifically you're seeing with these with the higher productivity, whether just related to longer longer laterals, and perhaps, you know, if this is a different zone up or down the column that where you're seeing these positive results.
John Christmann: Charles, what I would just say is you're starting to press the northern boundaries. You know, and we did space these a little wider and quite frankly, the results have been fantastic. So we're excited about that. I don't want to comment too much but, I mean, we've got some offset acreage so there's some other ramifications there, but we're very pleased with the results. They've been fantastic. And like I said, we'll be coming back and fortunately, we're gonna be able to space the wells on tighter spacing. But we'll come back with that. Right? But we're very, very excited about the potential up there.
Charles Meade: Okay. Well, stay tuned on that too. Thanks, John.
John Christmann: You bet, Charles.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold from RBC. Your question please.
Scott Hanold: Yeah. Thanks. If we could stick with the Permian for a minute, could you talk to a couple of things? One, I guess, in your presentation deck, talked about delineating some zones there. Can you just give us a sense of exactly what you're looking at and how much capital you're allocating to that this year? And secondarily, just in your Permian guidance, it does seem a little softer than sort of initial indications during the third quarter conference call. Just help me square the circle on that.
John Christmann: No. Scott, I would just say in Permian now, we've got eight rigs. They're lined out pretty well. That's why we will come back. There are some areas, you know, as always is the case, you're testing new zones and landing zones because we're always trying to build, you know, future inventory. So those the tests up in Howard County were two of those. You know, later last year, and, you know, we always sprinkle a few of those in. In terms of, you know, the overall guide with Permian, you know, we were we were looking high level. As you looked at last year. You know, you were you're coming off of us and Cowen. Combined running eleven rigs. We ran those. We started to drop down in the third quarter. You've seen us now level off at eight rigs.
Steve Riney: Yeah, Scott. If I could maybe give a little bit more detail. And John was right. We weren't typically in the third quarter results. We give directional guidance. We weren't trying to give guidance for 2025 for the Permian, but I understand why some people may have taken it that way. What we were basically saying is that 2025 wasn't since we had already come down to eight rigs by that time, 2025 was not gonna look like the fourth quarter. It was gonna look more like the third quarter. We were just kind of we were trying to give some directional view on that as opposed to precise guidance. But if I think it for you to be able to understand what's going on in our Permian assets, you kinda have to understand the pattern of activity and the volumes associated with that. And John talked about it. In the first half, we were running eleven rigs, and we were turning in line on average seventeen wells per month. Some of that included a little bit of duck activity, and some of it was drilling complete. In June, we started dropping rigs. We dropped one in June. We dropped one in July. Pretty quickly, we were down to eight rigs. And by the time we got to the end of the year, we'd finished the duck population and we've gotten down to where we were turning in line eleven wells per month. And so what the we came into the fourth quarter at a really at a peak of production volume. And if I talk about numbers that are that exclude our central basin platform that we sold on December 31st. We've peaked at production in the US at 140,000 barrels of oil a day in October. And then we began declining. We averaged 134 for the quarter, and the exit rate in December rather balanced between those two numbers, was 128. We exited that. So that that's the 134 average, which was the average for the fourth quarter. So the 128 was where we entered the first quarter. We've had some weather some uncharacteristic amount of weather downtime so far in the quarter. That brings us down to, you know, we believe our first quarter is probably gonna average 125 to 127. With that, though, I think what we've gotten to is we've gotten to a base of production volume with the eight rigs running for the most part since about September. That we're at a base production volume that we believe is sustainable through the year. And that's why our average guidance for the year for the full year is 125 to 127,000 barrels a day as well. So, hopefully, that gives a little bit more of the color behind why that's the why that's the case.
Scott Hanold: Yeah. No. No. I appreciate that. It's good color. I mean, a lot of tough questions you guys are answering today, but you I think you guys know what you need to do. Let me turn my second question to Egypt. Obviously, you know, the gas opportunity is encouraging. And can you give us a sense of when you when you look at your think it's twelve rigs you're gonna be running this year there. How do you balance those between oil and gas drilling? And is that going to change? And maybe a little color around what kind of infrastructure do you need to support the growth that could occur over the next couple years in gas?
John Christmann: Scott, we had to cut out when you said how do you balance I'm assuming how do you balance the rig count and then at the tail end, I heard you reference infrastructure. Can you can you just reframe that real quickly to make sure we answer the right question?
Scott Hanold: Yeah. I'm sorry if it went out. Yeah. The question was, how do you balance your twelve rig activity this year between oil and gas drilling and what kind of infrastructure do you need to add to really get a lot more gas growth going forward if the returns are pretty strong under the new contract?
John Christmann: Yeah. I'll step back. And number one, we're off to a really good start. And with the twelve rigs, we mentioned we picked up a rig in November. We dedicated that to gas and we kind of went after some things that were lower risk, that were high gas yields, with also some liquids and condensate. And so we've been able to drill a couple of really good wells. We've been able to bring them into infrastructure, which is why we're running pretty strong on the gas side. We are because they're high pressure, we have backed out some lower pressure gas in some areas because of the infrastructure requirements right now. But it's got us very confident in the gas program. And what you're likely to see us do is shift another rig or two to gas this year. So we'll probably maintain the twelve rigs, but we could run, you know, two to three rigs on the gas program. And quite frankly, we're anxious to get to some of the exploration targets as well. But the first thing to do is let's go ahead and go after some of the targets that we know we can get online. Get those flowing through, and that's why you're seeing the you know, our kind of our average gas price starting to creep up as we're bringing on some of that new strong gas. So the nice thing is you step back across the five million acres. We've got good infrastructure. At times, we've delivered. You know, this is the first time in a dozen years, really, where we've been able to start to flatten or bring our gas curve up. So there is infrastructure. But you know, it's gonna depend on what we find and how successful the program is. As to where we need to, you know, eliminate the what I'll call, bottlenecks or capacity or find ways to pipe the gas into areas where we can treat it. Or if we do have to build new infrastructure. So but in general, a good backbone of infrastructure very promising results, and quite frankly, we found a lot of gas in the Western Desert when we were looking for oil. So I'm really anxious to see as we start looking into some of the areas that we avoided because we knew they were gas rich, just what the capability would be.
Scott Hanold: Appreciate it. Thank you.
John Christmann: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani from Roth. Your question please.
Leo Mariani: Hi. I want to follow-up a little bit more on Egypt. I just want to get a sense of what the receivable situation is these days. Have you started to see a little bit more substantial pay down of that? And what's the kind of outlook you know, for that in 2025 in terms of getting some of your cash out?
John Christmann: Yeah. Leo, we were just in Cairo, and we're fortunate enough for the Egypt show I did a keynote there, and we were able I was actually able to meet with the president. So you know, if you go back and look over the last two years, the past due balance has been moving within a pretty tight band with due to timing. And so when you step back and look at it, they've been pretty much staying current on what they owe when the past due has not been really growing or shrinking. But we do have, you know, reason to believe that we'll make some progress on that. They're committed to making some progress on that. And, you know, so I think we should see some progress made this year.
Steve Riney: Yeah. And, Leo, if I could just add one thing to that. Some we in our supplement, we have a number of non-GAAP reconciliations in the back, and some people tend to look at those for working capital movements. It's not a pure working capital movement analysis, but it's somewhat it's characteristic of working capital movements. And if you look at the Egypt portion of that non-GAAP reconciliation, you might believe there was a big increase in receivables in the quarter. That is not correct. Receivables were basically flat in the quarter. What happened was we had an increase in drilling long leads. So it's just inventory for the drilling program. That's the working capital movement in Egypt.
Leo Mariani: Okay. Appreciate that. Wanted to jump over to the purchased oil and gas sales here. You guys are guiding to $600 million in 2025. Obviously referenced, you know, strip prices. Was hoping maybe you could kind of give a little bit of breakdown there in terms of you know, roughly how much is from the Cheniere contract, versus how much is kind of from your domestic gas optimization business?
Steve Riney: Yeah. No problem. So if we look at 2024, the actual if I've round round up maybe slightly, the pipelines that the trading of gas around the pipelines from Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast was about $330 million and the LNG contract was about $170 million for a total of $500 million for 2024. Pretty similar ratio for 2025 at this point according to strip prices, and there's lots of strip prices you gotta watch and all of that, obviously. The $600 million breaks down to about $400 million on the gas trading around the pipeline contracts, and about $200 million on the Cheniere LNG contract.
Leo Mariani: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Betty Jiang from Barclays. Your question please.
Betty Jiang: Hello. This is good morning. I want to go back and talk about the cost-cutting initiative because that's really a big part of the free cash flow expansion for us in the next few years. Just wanna understand. Is there anything structurally changing how the organization is being run or the milestones that's being set to just give us a bit of comfort around your ability to hit on these targets? Like, how much the breakdown between capital cost savings versus operating G&A savings and maybe just give us a bit more color on how you are thinking about executing on those targets.
John Christmann: Yeah. I'd say, Betty, if you step back, and you look at, you know, our three buckets, the biggest bucket is obviously gonna be the capital. The next one's gonna be the LOE, and then the next one's gonna be the G&A. And when you look at immediate impact that you can address, it's kind of in the reverse order, but you can address the G&A first and foremost. And so there's a lot of confidence in those numbers we've already gotten off to a pretty darn good start. As we mentioned in early January, we reduced the officer count by one-third. We followed that on here recently with some of the support staff, you know, as well. I think the G&A piece is one that we're getting on to. And then some of the other ones take more time. As you really get into how we run the business, how we, you know, leveraging synergies, and how are you driving the cost out. And some of that's with changes in technology and things that are taking place, you know, as you're seeing across corporate America today, you know, with this data and infrastructure and software, we spend a lot of money on those types of things. And so I mean, it takes a little bit longer on some of those, and then the efficiencies on the capital program are the ones that also take a little bit of time. But I you know, we're dead set on, you know, on the benchmarking side and what do we need to do to drive us up into top quartile, you know, on the cost performance.
Steve Riney: Yeah. And Betty, if I could just add a few things to that. You know, where did the $350 million target come from? I would emphasize it's at least $350 million. And as John alluded to, it did come from some fairly rigorous both internal and external benchmarking efforts. So we didn't just make the number up. It's actually got some science behind it. And we do believe it is something that we should be able to attain at least. But some of that is going to take longer than just a year. That's why we've set this up as a three-year program. We are not, at this point, providing a breakdown of that between capital and LOE and G&A, but as John said, by the time we get to the end of the three-year period, most of it's gonna come from capital. And then LOE and G&A will probably be competing for second and third probably somewhat similar amounts. We do believe that the $350 million is probably on the conservative end. But we're gonna be talking about this pretty much every quarter now for the next three years. As we go through this process. So there's still a lot to unfold here, and we'll give more and more detail as we go through quarter after quarter, especially during 2025.
Betty Jiang: That's great. I'll look forward to that. Dos at DosMetrix. My follow-up will be on the inventory duration that you see in the Permian. As you start fully incorporating the Cowen assets. What is your current assessment of your years of inventory life in both the Delaware and Midland today? Like, how many years you have of similar quality development if you continue at the current eight-rig pace.
John Christmann: Yeah. Betty, if we look at that today, we're confident we can see through 2029, you know, right into the next decade. And I think the track record and quite frankly, there's still a lot of stuff to characterize that we're working through. So, you know, we're confident that, you know, each year, we tend to add more locations than we drill. And that's something that we're working on and, you know, you're starting to see a lot of the results come in on Cowen, which have been good. And so we're confident that we'll continue to add to that. This is always the case. But we've got really, really good visibility, you know, to the end of this decade. With the program that we're running today.
Steve Riney: Yeah. And again, if I could just add a bit to that, you know, the reason why John alluded to 2029 is on the free cash flow per share chart that we provided in the supplement, and, basically, what we've got embedded in the assumptions underneath that growing free cash flow per share is that Permian roughly holds flat through that time period, and we're very confident we can do that and probably beyond 2029. We still have a lot of work to do on the Cowen acreage and for that matter, on our own acreage and getting fully characterized all of the acreage that we have and all of the potential landing zones. So and we know that the market is wanting to hear more about that. We're working on that. Still kind of fully digesting the Cowen acquisition in that regard. And we'll come back probably later this year with a more detailed look at our full view of what our portfolio looks like and inventory looks like in the Permian and how long that will last. But we're confident certainly beyond the it'll last beyond the range of that free cash flow chart.
Betty Jiang: That's great. Look forward to that. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, if you do have a question, please press star one one on your telephone. And our next question comes from the line of Bertrand Donz from Truist. Your question please.
Bertrand Donz: Hey, morning, guys. Just following up on slide four. Assuming you keep the 60% shareholder return program in place, which I believe is the plan, it looks like this could result in, you know, repurchasing a substantial portion of the shares. Just wanna understand how we should think about that, you know, that level of growing free cash flow versus the probably the natural desire to maybe increase activity a little bit or look externally to grow through, you know, acquisition? Just how do you balance those two?
Steve Riney: Yeah. So maybe I just take this opportunity to go through a number of the underlying assumptions on that free cash flow per share chart because I think they're important. It does assume that we capture and sustain $350 million of cost reductions. And frankly, 2025 and 2026 through to 2027, free cash flow per share is driven primarily through that $350 million of cost reductions. It is after-tax cost reductions. And then, obviously, 2028 begins Suriname block 58 production volumes. And as I indicated, Permian volumes are held relatively flat through that five-year time frame. Egypt, though, is actually on decline, similar to what we saw in 2024 and similar to what we're giving guidance to for 2025. And, actually, it does not include the Egypt production volumes in that do not include any of what we're seeing on the gas side right now because that's kind of fresh pretty fresh data. It includes all ARO and decom spend. It includes exploration spend. As it's clear on the chart, we assume $300 million per year annually for the third-party trading activity and the Cheniere contract. We do stay and we build into that chart. Built into that is the 60% capital returns framework. And to get to the answer of your on your question, the underlying assumptions in there are that we would in that five-year period, we would pay down $0.2 billion of debt. That's just the term loan that's existing now. Anything on the revolver and it includes bond debt that is. It would include $1.7 billion in dividends during that time frame. And it would include share buybacks of around 52 million shares. We have a price expectation that's underlying in that chart that says we trade at a constant a fixed multiple of free cash flow. So those with the free cash flow increasing over time, those 52 million shares are bought back at an average price over the five years of $33.65. So that's about $1.75 billion of share buyback during the five-year period.
Bertrand Donz: That's helpful. I guess the more to the question is, you know, if you're staring down, you know, this kind of free cash flow and if you don't see a price response in the shares, do you continue to buy back shares, or do you shift your strategy towards, you know, either production growth or external growth through acquisition?
John Christmann: I mean, today, you're gonna continue to buy back stock and, you know, as we believe in the asset base and you look at what's coming on in the free cash flow. So you know, I think you continue to invest in yourself under those circumstances.
Bertrand Donz: Understood. And then, just shifting gears, I appreciate the ARO disclosure for about $100 million this year. Just wondering if you could walk us through how that changes over time. Maybe your ARO and decommissioning costs over the next few years just directionally if that's all you can share? Thanks.
Steve Riney: Yeah. So the $100 million of ARO this year is it's broken down. It's about $40 million in legacy Gulf of America abandonment. It's about $30 million of North Sea, and it's about $30 million of onshore US. That's the hundred. And then in addition to that, we'll spend about $70 million this year on Fieldwood. I expect, other than the North Sea, I expect most of those to stay relatively flat. You'll spike from time to time just based on activities. But I think the North Sea will grow over time. We've talked about the profile of that. I think we talked about that extensively on the third quarter call. And so the North Sea will grow and others will stay relatively flat here for the next year. Four, five years.
Bertrand Donz: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum from TD Cowen. Your question please.
David Deckelbaum: Thanks for taking my questions, guys. I just wanted to follow-up just on that. Appreciate it. I just wanna follow-up just for clarification on the Egypt gas agreement. Just to confirm, this pertains to new drilling activity. And I'm just wanna get a sense of, you know, the comparative economics that you see relative to oil opportunities there. And how long the duration of this contract is for?
John Christmann: No. It is on new gas and it's set up, David, to where it's on par. Right? We put gas on par with oil. And that's why we're comfortable shifting the rigs. And, you know, quite frankly, Egypt's short gas. We've been, you know, on decline on the gas side. And so it truly is a win-win, and you're seeing that impact. So it puts gas on par with oil. It's on an incremental gas above an agreed decline curve. And, you know, you're seeing the impacts of that new gas, you know, come into our weighted average price.
Steve Riney: Yeah. And I'd just add to that that when we say it's on par with oil, that's on a full cycle basis. So it does have built into it into that price. It has built into it the anticipated cost of any infrastructure build-out that we might need to do if we were to be meaningfully successful on the gas exploration program.
David Deckelbaum: I guess it's still like I guess my follow-up is just to confirm. I know in the past, we've looked at sort of logistical constraints in Egypt around, you know, kind of big getting beyond the current rig counts. So should we think of this, like, overall as the line real quick count and that you'll just be allocating between gas and oil opportunities here.
John Christmann: I mean, I don't think so. I think we're in a good place today. Where we've been able to work the, you know, the workover projects and recompletions down to kind of a steady state. With the twelve rigs we're running a day and the twenty workover rigs we're running pretty darn good place. That's not the concern constraint here would be top-line rig count. It's really just gonna be getting to the opportunities. And initially, what we can do with the infrastructure. Right? So know, what we need to do is do exactly what we're doing. Bring on the low-hanging fruit, which we're going after, then we need to get some of the, you know, the nicer prospects drilled, which would give us some clues into what we wanna do on the infrastructure. In the future.
David Deckelbaum: Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.
Neil Mehta: Yeah. Good morning, John and team. I just want to spend some time on Suriname. And I guess this year is more about securing some long lead time items and recognizing the operator probably has a little bit more color here, but are you focused on, John, in terms of the milestones at that development for 2025 specifically.
John Christmann: No. I mean, I think we're off to a good start. As we said, CAP first quarter is a little heavy. Just because of some of the long leads that we've already purchased, some of the things with the FPSO and things. So we're tracking things well. Total's doing a fantastic job. You know, we're digging in on the development plan and those things and continuing to look at the block's future potential in terms of, you know, exploration and those things. So in general, you know, it's gonna be a year of good progress. Let's say, yeah, Total is off to a really good start and doing an excellent job.
Neil Mehta: And then John, on the Permian, you've talked about a pretty flattish profile in terms of the production here. Is there a scenario where you could accelerate production in that time horizon, do you feel like you have the inventory depth to do it or do you wanna run this business at plateau?
John Christmann: I mean, you know, Neil, there's no doubt. I mean, you look at what we were doing last year with eleven rigs, it was at a much, much higher rate. And we feel like, you know, ratcheting down, running this at eight, we can run it relatively flat, which is the plan for, you know, for more than just, you know, 2025. So it puts us in a pretty good spot, and that's why we've kinda rushed it down to this level. Clearly, there's inventory that you could ramp up. But quite frankly, you know, we wanna get in here and get into execution mode and deliver we can drive some of the cost efficiencies out of the cost curve and really improve the free cash flow while running it flat.
Steve Riney: Yeah. I could just add a bit to that. The thing that we talked about last year, probably on the third quarter call, was that strategically, we have a differentiated strategy around exploration, and with that type of a strategy and the investment that it requires, you don't need to be growing the base production volume in the Permian or in Egypt. If you're successful on the exploration side, the exploration provides the growth for the future. We just have this period of time 2025 to 2027 now that seems to be if we're producing flat from our core foundational portfolio, then our free cash flow is gonna be flat for three years and that's part of the impetus around the cost initiatives was to get that free cash flow per share moving up during that time frame as opposed to just waiting for Suriname growth to come across the hill in 2028.
Neil Mehta: Yep. That makes sense. And then driving your share count down in the process. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question and answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to John Christmann for CEO for any further remarks.
John Christmann: Yeah. Thank you. Over the last several years, we have transformed the portfolio by building sustainability and duration in our two foundational assets, the Permian and Egypt. Will be complemented by our world-class development in Suriname with first oil expected in 2028. We have set meaningful cost reduction targets we are confident we can deliver and see the potential to exceed these targets over time. This puts us on a path for substantial free cash flow growth in both the near and long term. With that, I will turn it back to the operator.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-07 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to APA Corporation's Third Quarter 2024 Financial and Operational Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. Now, I will pass the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Gary Clark. Please go ahead.
Gary Clark: Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's third quarter 2024 financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO, John Christmann. Steve Riney, President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer your questions are Tracy Henderson, Executive Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations. Our prepared remarks will be less than 20 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss on today's call. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And please note that our full year 2024 guidance reflects first quarter APA results on a standalone basis, plus three-quarters of APA and Callon combined. And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call today, I will discuss our key strategic accomplishments in the core areas of the portfolio, review third quarter highlights and results, and outline our preliminary capital, production, and cost outlook for 2025. Over the past several years, APA has delivered a number of strategic initiatives designed to enhance the portfolio and create shareholder value. In the U.S., since 2020, we have executed more than $5 billion of acquisitions and over $2.5 billion of divestitures, effectively transforming our asset base into an unconventional pure play Permian operation. This activity has three primary benefits. First, it has added scale to our unconventional Permian position, increasing unconventional acreage by more than 40% and enabling us to roughly double our unconventional production. Second, it has increased drilling inventory and extended inventory duration is the rig count today is lower than APA and Callon on a standalone basis. And third, it rationalized our portfolio by eliminating assets that did not compete for capital and significantly reduces per unit LOE. Our primary strategic accomplishments in Egypt are two-fold, both of which drive APA shareholder value and benefit the Egyptian people over the life of the PSC. In late 2021, we modernized and extended our PSC terms, paving the way for more efficient capital allocation, more operational flexibility and greater free cash flow generation. And we recently reached an agreement to increase the contractual price for incremental natural gas production in country making gas exploration and development more economically competitive with oil development. Shifting to Suriname. We are now seeing the culmination of our strategic efforts that began more than 10 years ago, when we made a countercyclical investment in long-cycle offshore exploration. The recently announced GranMorgu project FID gives us visibility into strong future oil production growth at the most attractive economics in our entire portfolio. Importantly, we believe this project can easily be funded over the next few years through operating cash flow allowing us to maintain our current capital returns framework. Turning now to the third quarter results and highlights. APA achieved several important milestones during and subsequent to the end of the third quarter. We announced the sale of a package of non-core Permian properties for $950 million, which is expected to close in December. We reached FID on our first development project offshore Suriname in Block 58 with a partner and operator, Total Energies. We signed an agreement in Egypt that increases our contractual natural gas price on incremental volumes and we received a credit rating upgrade from Standard & Poor's, thus achieving investment-grade status at all three major rating agencies. Third quarter results were strong across the board as we exceeded our production guidance, while capital and costs were below guidance. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow increased compared to the second quarter despite weaker WTI oil prices and significantly lower Waha gas prices. This resilience results from some unique attributes of the APA portfolio as well as some recent specific initiatives. These include the successful integration of Callon and associated cost synergy capture, cash flow resilience to lower prices in Egypt under the PSC structure, near-term organic oil production growth, strong cash flow from our LNG contract, and having the optionality to curtail US volumes when Waha pricing is negative, while still generating cash flow from gas trading, the real value of which lies in the preservation of resource for a better price environment. We expect all of these will continue to generate positive financial impacts in the fourth quarter. Turning now to our key operational areas. US oil volumes have now met or exceeded guidance for the 7th straight quarter. Since closing the Callon acquisition on April 1st, we have reduced our Permian rig count from 11 down to 8, which we believe is an appropriate pace given the prevailing commodity price environment. We have successfully integrated Callon and turned our focus to developing the acreage. Our initial wells on acquired Callon acreage are flowing back in the Midland Basin and the early results are encouraging. The first wells in the Delaware Basin on Callon acreage will follow later this quarter. In Egypt, operations are running to plan, and gross oil production is tracking accordingly. The reduction in our drilling program has enabled the workover rig fleet to reduce backlog oil volumes associated with delayed recompletions and workovers to more normalized levels. Pursuant to the terms of the new gas price agreement, we recently added one drilling rig, bringing our total rig count to 12. Moving on to Suriname. We recently achieved an important milestone with the announcement of the final investment decision on our first offshore development in Block 58. The operator, Total, summarized the project is having a $10.5 billion gross cost, 220,000 barrels per day of production capacity, a per BOE capital plus OpEx cost of $19 at a 15% IRR at $60 per barrel. These are very good returns and APA's economics will be further enhanced by the capital carry provision we negotiated in 2019 when we brought Total in as a partner. We plan to fund Suriname development capital out of operating cash flow for the next few years until production commences in 2028. As previously noted, we see significant opportunity for additional exploration in Block 58 that could extend the production plateau and enhance the economics of our first FPSO and or potentially support additional development projects in the future. Switching now to the North Sea. During the third quarter, production volumes were in line with guidance as we completed our platform maintenance turnaround at Beryl as planned. Earlier this year, the U.K. issued regulations, which will require substantial new emissions control investments on facilities that will operate beyond 2029. After six months of evaluation, we have concluded that the investment required to comply with these regulations at 40s and Beryl, coupled with the onerous financial impact of the energy profits levy makes production of hydrocarbons beyond the year 2029 uneconomic. As a result, we have made the decision to cease all production in the North Sea by December 31, 2029, well ahead of what would have been an otherwise reasonable time frame. Steve will provide further details on the revised schedule and financial statement impacts of this change in a few minutes. In the wrap up operations, we have finalized plans to resume exploration drilling on our extensive state lease position in Alaska, where we will test the Sockeye prospect during the first half of 2025. Turning now to our preliminary activity plan and outlook for 2025. We currently expect to run an eight-rig program in the Permian Basin and a 12-rig program in Egypt. In the North Sea, we will have a very limited capital program focused primarily on maintaining asset safety and integrity and a small amount of initial P&A work in preparation for long-term asset abandonment. Our 2025 capital budget for the U.S., Egypt and North Sea will likely be in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, with an additional $200 million allocated to Suriname development activity and $100 million for exploration, primarily Alaska. This capital program should broadly sustain production volumes in the Permian and Egypt on an adjusted BOE basis, while North Sea production will be down approximately 20% year-over-year. I would also like to highlight the significant cost reductions we are targeting in 2025. In aggregate, we expect per unit LOE, G&A, GPT and interest costs to fall by 10% to 15% year-over-year. In closing, we have made very good progress on our strategic portfolio initiatives in the US, Egypt and Suriname. We had an excellent quarter operationally and achieved all key guidance targets. The Callon integration is complete, most of the cost synergies have been captured and we look forward to demonstrating the potential of the acquired Callon acreage. Egypt is running at a much more efficient operational cadence, and we have the opportunity to unlock incremental value and assist the country with its natural gas needs, following the negotiation of a new price framework. Under our current price outlook, we will seek to generally sustain volumes in the Permian and Egypt for the foreseeable future while rigorously managing costs and increasing the free cash flow that these regions generate. Longer term, a successful exploration program can add tremendous value and fuel future growth as evidenced by Suriname Block 58. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Riney: Thank you, John. For the third quarter, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA reported a consolidated net loss of $223 million or $0.60 per diluted common share. As usual, these results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which was a $571 million after-tax impairment of North Sea assets and non-core Permian assets held for sale. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the third quarter was $370 million or $1 per share. John noted in his remarks that we have revised the expected timetable for cessation of production and abandonment of our assets in the North Sea. This decision had three primary impacts this quarter. The previously mentioned after-tax asset impairment, of which $325 million was related to the North Sea, a $17 million barrel of oil equivalent write-down of reserves that we no longer expect to produce, and a $116 million increase in the net after-tax present value of abandonment obligations on our balance sheet. We now carry an after-tax present value liability of $1.2 billion for all of our North Sea ARO. We are planning to incur this liability between now and 2038. Approximately half of this liability will be incurred between now and the end of 2030. While there will be some overlap, the next five years will consist of mostly wellbore abandonment while the remaining eight years will focus mostly on facility abandonment. We expect Beryl Bravo will be the first facility to cease production likely in late 2027 or early 2028. Moving over to Egypt. We continue to make good progress on past due receivables. And during the quarter, both total and past due receivables decreased. When payments on past due receivables are made, there is a counterintuitive impact on our stated free cash flow for the quarter because of the way we define free cash flow for the purposes of our 60% cash returns framework. If you have questions about how to model these cash flows, please work with Gary and his team. Debt reduction is a continuing area of focus at APA. While total debt increased with the Callon acquisition, one of our goals is to liquidate the Callon debt as soon as possible. We made progress on this front in the third quarter and will continue to do so in the coming quarters. The Callon deal brought increased scale in the Permian, which, coupled with our commitment to return to pre-acquisition debt levels was a significant factor in our recent credit rating upgrade by S&P. To close, I would like to provide a bit of color on some of our changes in our fourth quarter and 2024 full year guidance. Our full year capital budget has increased to $2.75 billion, which primarily reflects increases to fourth quarter spend on development capital in Suriname, following the October project FID, our recent decision to drill another exploration well in Alaska this winter and the addition of a 12th rig in Egypt. These items, which were previously not contemplated in our guidance, were partially offset by the reduction of 1 rig in the Permian Basin. Turning to our US production guidance. You'll note that we have adjusted our fourth quarter outlook to reflect the estimated impact of frac activity deferrals and planned production curtailments. With much weaker-than-expected Waha pricing this quarter, we decided to curtail gas from our Alpine High area, as we typically do. We also decided to curtail some high-volume high GOR oil wells, which will generate higher revenue under a more constructive future gas price. We currently project this will have a 20,000 to 25,000 BOE impact on US production. However, this estimate is subject to considerable volatility depending on how regional gas prices progress through the fourth quarter. As most of you are aware, our income from third-party oil and gas purchased and sold is generally correlated to Waha price differentials. Accordingly, with the persistence of weak pricing into the fourth quarter, we are raising our full year estimate to $500 million. Approximately two-thirds of which is attributable to our gas trading activities and one-third is attributable to the Cheniere gas supply contract. And to close, most of our $250 million Callon synergy target should be realized by the end of this year. We anticipate reaching full synergy realization through 2025 and we did not plan continued reporting on these efforts from this point forward. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] And it comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Wolf Research. Please proceed.
Doug Leggate: Thanks, guys. Good morning. A lot this quarter. So I'm going to hit two. One is Egypt, and one is the oil guide. So first of all, in Egypt, you've obviously -- you haven't given any color whatsoever around the gas price other than the fact that you got better pricing. So to what extent can you help us frame the impact of this? I guess it costs you about , I don't know, $25 million net for that additional rig. How do we think about the incremental free cash flow based on your current visibility on that gas price? That's my first one. My second one is, clearly, the oil guide has got a lot of moving parts, not least the sale of the Central Basin platform. So can you just walk through the moving parts on the apples-for-apples acquisition versus disposals to get us to kind of net number just to make sure that the Street is looking at it on an apples-for-apples basis. And I'll leave it there.
John Christmann: Yeah. Two really good questions, Doug. I'll step in first on Egypt and let Steve follow up, and then we can come back to the Permian and the oil guide. But if you step back in Egypt in the Western Desert, we've historically always explored for oil. Obviously, the country of Egypt is now in a position where they need gas. And so we've been working on a framework, which would bring gas exploration wells up to parity with oil wells. It is on incremental volumes. We're not in a position to get into a lot of detail on how that is calculated, but you will be able to see it showing up on our income statement going forward. We've allocated 1 rig. We've got a lot of low-hanging fruit, as you know. If you step back and look at the Western Desert, while we've always run oil exploration programs, we found Caser, which is a 3 Tcf field back in the early 2000s. So there's tremendous potential for gas in Egypt. We've got a lot of low-hanging fruit. This will be on incremental gas volumes, and it's going to put our exploration program on par with an oil program.
Steve Riney: Yes. So what we mean by incremental gas volumes is as part of the agreement, we've agreed with EGPC what our PDP decline looks like till for the full development or the full remaining life of the concession. So gas PDPs, a decline curve. And for every quarter, we'll look at how much gas was produced and any gas over that decline curve in that quarter gets the new price. It doesn't have to be from new wells. It doesn't have to be from new fields. So gas compression can bring on more gas volumes, enhanced recovery, step-outs, infield step-outs and infill, things like that, all qualify for incremental gas volume. As John said, we're -- we've priced it to where we're indifferent economically drilling an oil well or drilling a gas well. And as part of that agreement, we agreed to add 1 rig. As we've said, we have already done that. And I would just say we've got -- just to build on what John was saying, we've got 5 million acres of hydrocarbon-rich resource here. There's been, as John said, no gas-focused exploration. So we believe that there's quite a bit of prospectivity. We've actually got some previously discovered gas-focused resource. Some of that may need some appraisal, but there's quite a bit that's still -- that's ready for appraisal and development investment. infrastructure is in place because we do produce a lot of gas today. There is some haulage in that infrastructure. And to the extent that we might need it in the future, any further build-out of infrastructure was contemplated in the price that we negotiated. And I don't know, Tracy, if you want to talk about maybe a little bit about prospectivity for gas in Egypt.
Tracy Henderson: Sure, Steve. As John and Steve said, we've really focused our exploration program on oil. So gas is really underexplored relative to oil, but we see significant potential. We have a good understanding of the geology and the source rocks having been there for two decades. And we know the areas that are more gas prone and the basins that are more gas prone. So we do have a known inventory of low-risk resource potential with material volumes. And in addition, we will be testing some exploration gas prospects and concepts to continue to grow that inventory over time. So we see a lot of potential in those opportunities, and we're excited to have a gas-focused program, and it's a great opportunity to grow the inventory and add value to our business in Egypt.
Steve Riney: And Doug, just to wrap that point up, that question. So we're not going to share specifics about the gas price agreement with Egypt. We're just -- we're not going to do that at this point in time at their request. You will start to see this show up in results. We'll think about -- I understand your point about wanting to get to how do we forecast free cash flow. I don't know a price. We'll start thinking about how -- between now and February when we give a final plan for 2025 and possibly beyond. We'll give some help in being able to figure out what this means for free cash flow. We understand the point.
John Christmann: And if I can take the second question, Doug, on the Permian oil, we've been running nine rigs. We've scaled back. We're at eight rigs, and that's what we plan to run for next year. If you take our Q3 numbers, which we just put out 143 on the oil side for Permian and you subtract the upcoming asset sales of 13,000 barrels a day. That's going to put you around 130,000. And we believe we can maintain that or hold that flat with a rig count that's down about 20%, turn in lines that are down 20% and CapEx, which is in line with that. So we think it's actually pretty strong. But for next year, you're looking at -- and this is obviously the preliminary view, as you know. We're looking at about 130,000 barrels a day of oil in the US that we can hold flat with eight rigs.
Doug Leggate: Got it. Thanks guys. I appreciate the answers.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question is from John Freeman with Raymond James. Please proceed.
John Freeman: Good morning, guys.
John Christmann: Good morning, John.
John Freeman: First topic, just a little bit more infill on the North Sea. So I just want to make sure that I'm understanding. So the way that you laid it out, Steve, of the ARO, you said about half would potentially be spent between now and the end of 2030. And I guess I'm just trying to understand in terms of just outflow of capital, as you all like ratchet down the CapEx in the North Sea over the next several years and then factoring the AROs, just sort of how I should think about just capital being spent in total in the North Sea over these next 10 full years. When I know the -- it's a minimal spend CapEx-wise in the North Sea next year, but just any color on that front would be helpful.
Steve Riney: Yeah. So the spend on the ARO won't show up as capital. You'll actually see a number in the -- the costs incurred, where we provide some reconciliations to GAAP versus non-GAAP reconciliations in our supplement, and you'll see a number in there for the North Sea for the addition to the ARO. So from a GAAP accounting purposes, the increase in the ARO is considered costs incurred which is a GAAP kind of equivalent or somewhat equivalent to capital spending. So it shows up when you add to the ARO, it doesn't show up as capital spending in the CapEx program as we spend that capital or those dollars in the years in which we incur the ARO. And John, just to give maybe a little bit more color on the spend patterns. So as I said, the -- if you were to combine two numbers because there's a there's a gross obligation on the liability side on our balance sheet, and then there's a deferred tax asset because there's a 40% tax savings for every dollar that you spend on ARO. So there's two numbers on our balance sheet. Those two numbers net to $1.2 billion. It's -- with a 40% tax rate, you could probably figure out pretty quickly, it's about $2 billion of liability. It's about an $800 million tax asset on the balance sheet. And that $1.2 billion, as I said, roughly 50% of that will be spent between now and the end of 2030. A lot of that is being spent on wellbore abandonment. And so you figure out -- you figure okay, that's about $100 million a year for six years. And what I would say is the pattern grows through the period of time. So it's going to be way less than $100 million next year in 2025, starts kind of ramping up a little bit in 2026. The first three years are below $100 million a year, the last three years are above $100 million a year.
John Freeman: That's perfect. I appreciate all the color on that. And then on the LOE, which you all are indicating a pretty big decline next year, 10% to 15% decline. And you mentioned the drivers, and there's obviously a lot of moving parts with the account synergies, the noncore Permian divestitures or curtailed volumes. Is there any way to give maybe just sort of a rough kind of idea of just ballpark, like the magnitude of each of those from like a driver of that decline year-over-year, just some way you think about.
John Christmann: Yes. I mean, John, we really haven't thought about how to break that out. I mean what we've tried to do is just look at the stand-alone business next year as you're going into that and roll everything up. Obviously, a big chunk of that is on the Callon side is the synergies we've been able to drive out, but a lot of it comes to just a change in the portfolio changes that we've made in the US, selling the higher cost, declining waterflood assets on the Central Basin platform, which are typically much, much higher costs, and we handle a lot of water. So it's really a recharacterization of our unconventional Permian Basin business is what you're going to see. And I can also tell you, there's -- we're working hard on how to do more than what we've laid out at this point.
Steve Riney: Yes. And I'd just add, John, we'll provide quite a bit more detail around that when we roll out the detailed plan in February. What we're trying to -- what we always try to do at this point in time in the year just kind of give a shape to the capital program and what that means to production volume more than anything else, kind of the meat of the direction of the firm. But there is that one chart in the supplement. And it's got multiple elements in it. You might want to just give Gary a call later today or sometime and he might take be able to take you through some of the details behind that.
John Freeman: Understood. Thanks guys.
John Christmann: Thank you, John.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.
Bob Brackett: Good morning. I had a question around the cadence of the cash return strategy and the timing. There's a big moving part around your disposals and getting that cash in the door and 3Q percent of free cash flow return came down a bit. Should I think of that as timing versus anything else?
John Christmann: I mean, definitely, it's just timing, Bob. We came into the year. We're running a little bit ahead. And then you look at Q3, we've had a lot of material things that were in the works that can sometimes prevent you from being able to get in the market at times. But in general, yes, it's more just timing that was out of our control.
Bob Brackett: Very clear. A quick follow-up on gas curtailment and your latest thoughts are on the ground intelligence around Matterhorn. Matterhorn feels slow, but it's coming. Is that your expectation that we'll get some takeaway out of the Permian, realizations will improve, and that's when the curtailment ends? And what's your latest that you hear happening in the basin?
Steve Riney: Yeah. I believe most of the price extremes, if you want to call them that right now are not related to Matterhorn, but are related to some downtime on other pipelines coming out of the Permian and to the Gulf Coast. And I think that's impacting the pricing extremes as we see them today. That maintenance activity, I believe, is planned to be completed in the next week or so. So I think this is a matter of perhaps just days first of month for December a couple of days ago, was $1.40, so not a great price, but at least better than negative $3 or $3.50.
Bob Brackett: Very clear. Thank you.
John Christmann: Thank you, Bob.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.
Roger Read: Yeah, thank you. Good morning. I guess, I'd like to come back on the lowering of the cost. I mean, it looks obviously a piece of an LOE, but a lot of the G&A, and what is that? Or is that in addition to the synergy you anticipated from the Callon merger? I mean, I would think so, given the way it's laid out here. But I just wanted to understand what was driving some of these opportunities.
John Christmann: I think, Roger, it's clearly synergies on the Callon side, but it's also some of the simplification on our business with the asset sales.
Steve Riney: Yeah. And the other thing I would just add, in our synergies around the Callon transaction, we said that around $90 million of that would be related to G&A and Callon had a G&A cost structure of around $110 million a year. Our G&A right now is running basically flat with where we were prior to the Callon acquisition. So I think some of the G&A synergies are going to be around just growing the -- increasing or exceeding the amount of synergies that we thought, we basically -- it's not all Callon people because we actually have a number of Callon people here in the company, but we've equivalently eliminated the full Callon G&A. There were some one-off costs in G&A in 2024 around the transaction as well.
Roger Read: Yes. No, I appreciate that. And then, John, my question for you since you got the Alaska exploration well. And obviously, all those decisions had to be made preelection. In terms of regulatory outlook, certainly, it looks easier to do business in Alaska with the federal government at this point, just wondering, how you're looking at that. Assume good or bad with this particular well, but as you think about the overall Alaska opportunity.
John Christmann: Yes. I think the main thing there, I'll remind you, Roger, is we've got about 300,000 acres in our position, but it's state lands. And so we're in a position where you're fairly close to pipeline, and we're state land. So, you don't really have to bring the federal side in, but just on a few things. So we feel good about that. We're excited about Alaska. We had a discovery earlier this year on the well that we did get down. And we're going back to 1 of the 2 that we attempted last winter, but we're very excited about it. So it will be early, early next year when we spud, and we have added some capital to start building ice roads and stuff for this winter.
Roger Read: I Appreciate that. But one federal roadblock is sometimes more than enough. So I just wanted to check on that.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question that comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Please proceed.
Paul Cheng: Hi. Good morning team. John, you guys done the Callon deal, even though I think Apache probably do better than Callon. But when you go through that, have you found there's anything that you learned from them saying that they're actually doing better than us and where that they probably have done the worst?
John Christmann: Yes. I mean, obviously, Paul, when you integrate 2 companies, you take good from both and try to replicate. I think Callon had some good people that we've integrated into the organization. Obviously, they've got some good acreage that we're excited to get after as well. And then we've been digging into a lot of their technical assumptions as well. But I think in general, you've seen us be able to cut costs just from our supply chain and some of our processes. We've cut almost $1 million per well in terms of the well cost side, we're anxious on the spacing, and we've got 2 wells flowing back or actually 4 now, but 2, we've got pretty good results on in the Midland Basin. And we're seeing some pretty good uplift on those 2. So we're pretty excited about Callon in general.
Paul Cheng: No, I was just asking that. Is there anything that from a technology or process that Callon you actually find that they are doing well, and then you will be able to adopt their process or technology and enhance your operations?
John Christmann: Yes. I would say on the spacing side, I mean, we're looking hard into the data and how they were approaching the development scenarios, and how we take -- how we designed it versus how they were and how do you modify that to what we think is a better answer.
Steve Riney: Yes. And if I could just add to that. That's what I was going to say earlier was that it'd be really simple just to bring all of that acreage into the Apache process and just assuming, well, we're right, we've got everything figured out, and we're going to do it exactly the way we do everything else. Instead, I think it's always a good idea to just step back and think, okay, well, do they have any aspects of spacing and fracking and landing zones, and what's in communication, what's not in communication. So, it's good just to take the opportunity to step back and question what we believe and our fundamental beliefs there as well, and we're doing that. And I think it's worth doing. We will come to some conclusions in due course. But it's worth asking ourselves those questions.
Paul Cheng: Steve, can you quantify what's the benefit? Because I assume those is not in your original synergy target?
Steve Riney: No. At this point, I'd say I can't quantify the benefits of that. But we'll do that in due course. I think we'll -- I think we've got to get more wells drilled, completed and online and get some history to those. And we've talked about it in the past, at some point in time in 2025, we have the $250 million of annual cash operating -- operational and overhead type cost synergies, but we do believe that there are some meaningful synergies around the capital productivity or capital efficiency, whichever you want to call it. And we've said in the past, we will come back sometime in 2025 with a recap of where we think we are there. And that will include -- just like the synergies have included, that will include things that we've learned from the combination with Callon, and how that helps even the Apache approach to the rest of our acreage as well.
Paul Cheng: Okay. The second question is on Alaska. John, you guys are going back? And can you tell us that you guys essentially going back to the same two wells that you suspend in last year program, and you're just going to redo that or that you are targeting a total new prospect?
John Christmann: No, Paul, it's actually going back to the Saki prospect. [Technical Difficulty]
Operator: Please stand by, we have some technical audio difficulties. Please stand by, ladies and gentlemen. And you may continue. Thank you for standing by.
John Christmann: Yes.
Operator: Yes, you are live.
John Christmann: We're back up. I apologize. We had an internet disconnect, but we're back. So.
Operator: So one moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist. Please proceed.
Neal Dingmann: Good morning. Thanks for the time, John. My question, maybe just around Permian Egypt production, specifically, you all -- the target you talked about for next 8 Permian and 12 Egyptian rigs. I'm just wondering, is that, again, kind of the plan to maintain. You think that's about appropriate to maintain stable production in both those areas. And I'm just wondering when it comes to base production. Has that changed much in either area? So I'm trying to get a sense of how we should think about sort of maintaining the flat production.
John Christmann: Yes. We've designed that -- the early look design is a program to sustain Permian oil, Neal, around the 130 that I mentioned earlier with Doug's first question. And then in Egypt, it's really our reported production, but the gross has been coming down slightly. If you look at on the oil side with 11. Right now, you've got 12 rigs, 11 to the oil program, one to the gas is what we've got in there. At 11, we're slightly underinvesting in Egypt, but it's close.
Steve Riney: Yes. If I can just add to that briefly. I mean we started the year with -- as people know, we started the year with 18 drilling rigs. We ended the year with 12. We went down to 11 at one point in time. If you just look back at the -- when we said that gross oil volume would slightly decline as we go through the year. Well, first quarter was 138,000 barrels a day. Second quarter was 139,000. In third quarter, it was 137,000. So we're on a slight decline. I would emphasize the slight aspect of that. And I think that, that's probably going to just continue into fourth quarter and on into 2022, absent a change in the drilling activity. But that's that if people go back to 2023, we were in the mid-140s with 18 rigs running for quite some time, and we were kind of struggling to maintain production volume or to grow it from there. So as we've commented a few times, we've actually -- with 11 rigs, we've achieved kind of a nice, very smooth operational cadence that's working really well. We have increased that to 12. The thing I would say about 2025 is that the 12th rig is drilling gas-focused wells, and some of those will be appraised. Some will be development wells, some will be low-risk appraisal type of step outs, some of them will be exploration, looking for bigger, better prospects, which we believe there are -- they are out there. And so the potential for gas, I would say, is unknown at this point in time. We're certainly optimistic. We believe there's good prospectivity, but the potential is still a bit unknown. The other thing I would say is that we've -- in the last, I would say, in the last 1.5 years, we've learned a lot about what we can be doing around improving our focus on waterflood management, and we've got a lot of plans in 2025 for working that. And I think the potential for that we have yet to really see what that can do on a decline mitigation basis, the best way to maintain production volumes in a country like Egypt is to mitigate decline, not to be trying to drill too many wells. So we're working on both fronts, and we'll see what 2025 brings. But if everything is kind of equal with 2024, we'll probably just continue on this pattern of just a slight decline.
Neal Dingmann: Got it. And then just second, you've talked a bit about this already today, but just with shareholder return, I mean, you guys in other periods where the stock has gotten here, have been very opportunistic coming in pretty aggressively. I'm just wondering given recent pricing is that potentially in the cards?
John Christmann: And I think clearly, we've got our time periods fastest. We're running ahead Neal, but we do think that share price is obviously attractive. We've got the proceeds coming in from the asset sales. The majority of that is going to go to debt reduction as we're also working to get debt paid down as well.
Neal Dingmann: Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And it comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Arun Jayaram: I wanted to go back to Egypt and gas. Steve, you mentioned that over time that you can make up, call it, the PDP wedge with incremental volumes where you get the higher gas price I was wondering if you could help us think about what the PDP decline rate looks like for gas in Egypt and obviously in the Caesar field specifically?
John Christmann: Yes, Arun, I'll take that one. Caesar's been on decline. We've gone through some stages of compression. It is the big portion of our gas is Caesar, but we also produce a lot of casing head gas with a lot of the other oil wells. So Caesar has been in the double-digits there. And obviously, we'll have to see with the new program can we fill the overall gas decline, but I think we've got an opportunity to add some incremental volumes that could be pretty material.
Arun Jayaram: Understood. Understood. And then just maybe a follow-up. John, with the North Sea now in kind of a late cycle stage in terms of the life cycle of that development of the field. And then obviously, Suriname starting up in 2028, how are you thinking about – thinking about another leg to the stool in terms of the portfolio, obviously, you sold some assets recently. But how are you thinking about just the broader portfolio? And obviously, given the North Sea where it's at, adding another leg to the stool?
John Christmann: Yes. I mean, I think if you step back, we've got what we believe are two really strong long-term legs of the stool with both Permian or kind of our reshaped and reworked Permian unconventional business. We think we can hold that flat at a very efficient rig count for the foreseeable future. Egypt is a large asset. We've been there now for over three decades. We see a lot of running room in Egypt as well. Suriname will start to come on in 2028 and will be very material. And so if you step back and look at that, and we just maintain the two large onshore positions. 2028, Suriname's going to put in some pretty nice growth relative to those two assets. So I mean I think portfolio is in pretty good shape. We're always looking to how we improve it. But I think we've got with Suriname stepping in and coming on in 2028, it's going to be a nice add to what are two really nice core positions, both in the Permian and the US and Egypt.
Arun Jayaram: Understood. Plus the exploration in Alaska near...
John Christmann: Absolutely. And I think the key there, Arun, is we've stayed committed. We've been spending a small portion of our budget in exploration. I think we've got a wonderful staff. And as I said in the prepared remarks, with successful exploration, you can add real shareholder value and Suriname Block 58 is a perfect example of that. So we've got a nice portfolio. We're excited about it. We'll continue to fund a little bit. But we also know where we make our real money is in our core assets and driving our free cash flow from Permian and Egypt.
Arun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot John.
Operator: Thank you so much. One moment for our next question, that comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please proceed.
Charles Meade: Good morning, John to you and your whole team there.
John Christmann: Good morning, Charles.
Charles Meade: Thank you. I wanted to ask a question about Suriname, and you put this slide in your supplement on slide 11, and I always -- I like these kind of mockup cartoons that give a sense of the development layout. But what -- when you guys decided to include this, what are you -- besides the numbers on the right side of the slide, what do you really hope people take away from this when they see this? And what's the -- so what you want people to get about the GranMorgu?
John Christmann: Well, I mean I think it's just given -- it's a real project today, right? So I mean, we've got visibility now to volumes in 2028. And so I think it's time that you put some slides out there that bring it to life. And that's why we put the picture out there. You can see this is kind of looking from deepwater in. You'll see where the FPSO will be placed. This is a total slide. You see with Krabdagu, it's a fairway, as we've talked about in terms of the development opportunities that we've appraised there. And looking over at Sapakara, it's more of a field. The thing I would also say along that fairway is there will be more exploration prospects and potential tiebacks as well. So it's something we're excited about. It's material. It's large. But I think it's just bringing this project to life, because it's real today, and we're looking forward to 2028.
Charles Meade: That’s great. That’s it from me. Thank you, John.
John Christmann: You bet, Charles. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you so much. One moment for our next question that comes from the line of Leo Mariani with ROTH. Please proceed.
Leo Mariani: Hi. Thanks. Just wanted to inquire a little bit about the kind of activity plan in the US, it sounds like you guys are basically kind of pulling back there. Oil is roughly at 70. You guys are kind of citing a softer oil outlook. Just kind of curious, are you expecting kind of oil prices to be lower next year? I mean, obviously, you just bought the Callon asset. You saw some pretty nice organic growth the last couple of quarters on a combined basis, and now you're kind of choosing to pull back. Can you just provide a little bit more color on sort of the thinking there as we roll into next year?
John Christmann: Yes. Leo, I just think we're in a softer price environment. We've got an asset base that we can sustain volumes with eight rigs. We're going to work on efficiencies. It's always easy to pick up those rigs up. But I think with where we're moving into 2025, it feels like a good place to be initially. And the nice thing is, like I said, if we can sustain Permian and roughly sustained Egypt. You've got Suriname coming in the next -- 2028 from an overall corporate level.
Leo Mariani: Okay. And then maybe just jumping over to Egypt here, so I think you guys made a comment there on the call that you expect that we could see some very modest declines on Egyptian gross oil, but I know you're expecting to keep adjusted or net production on oil, relatively flat. So maybe you're expecting to get a slightly higher share of that oil. I don't know if that's just related to expectations for lower prices in the PSCs for next year. I was hoping you could address that quickly. And then also just on Egypt Gas, you got the gas rig going. What's your expectation there on gas production in Egypt for next year? Can that start to flatten out, maybe in the second half? Do you see any growth in Egypt gas as we get towards the end of the year or next year?
John Christmann: Yeah. I'd just say, if you look in Egypt at 11 rigs, as Steve mentioned, we've been declining slightly at the top line. It's been very, very slight over the last four quarters. So at 11, it's about where we probably are on the gross oil side. We're actually getting after some of the waterflood projects as well, which the benefit those have is they flatten your decline. So then it's -- with the strong waterflood program, then you can improve that. And then on the gas side, our overall gross gas is declining. But with this program and we've got a one-rig program laid out and some nice quick prospects to get after that we can get to infrastructure. We'll bring new volumes on and then we'll -- we've got some bigger prospects to drill and then we'll see. So I think the key there is we're getting started with that. And after we get some prospects down, we'll have a better clue of scale on the gas side in the future.
Leo Mariani: All right. Thanks.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betty Jiang with Barclays. Please proceed.
Betty Jiang: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I want to go back to the North Sea ARO conversation. So I think the $1.2 billion is on a present value basis. So wondering, if you could give the total liability on an absolute basis? And I think the as we think about the cash outflow related to this, does your free cash flow calculation include this outflow as you think about the capacity for tax returns in any given year? Thanks.
Steve Riney: Yeah. So I'll give you -- I've already given you two numbers. I'll give you a third number as well. So again, the two numbers I've given are that we've got about a $2 billion liability on our balance sheet. US GAAP requires that we take what we think the current cost is of abandoning all of those assets as if we had to abandon them today. We inflate that into the future and then we discount that back at prescribed inflation and discount rates. So we've got that -- when you take the cost today, inflate them and then discount them back, you get $2 billion. Today cost estimate is $2.5 billion. So obviously, the inflation rate is lower than the discount rate that we have to use for that, which is our borrowing rate, for that 10 to 15-year timeframe. Then there's the tax benefit of all of that. The present value of that tax benefit is $800 million. So that's offsetting the $2 billion present value getting to the $1.2 billion net, which is a net after-tax present value liability on our balance sheet today. Two different numbers on the balance sheet, $2 billion liability, $800 million deferred tax asset. What was the second part of the question?
Betty Jiang: Just on the free cash flow calculation, when you think about the organic free cash flow is related to cash return, does this cash outflow gets netted out of that?
Steve Riney: Yes, it will. And just I think …
Betty Jiang: Appreciate it…
Steve Riney: …and let's just remember, we've talked a lot, and I understand why we talked a lot and kind of focused on the abandonment activity that's ahead of us and the costs associated with that. Let's just not forget that we still have operating assets in the North Sea. Those continue to generate free cash flow even after a 78% tax rate. And those -- that free cash flow will help us pay for a lot of those costs here in the next several years.
Betty Jiang: Understood. Thank you for that. My follow-up is on the gas marketing piece. This year, really surprised with how powerful the benefit on the gas marketing side in a weak Waha gas environment. Can you give us a flavor of under the current features, price on Waha spread, would you be able to continue to capture above normal marketing benefit next year as well?
Steve Riney: Yeah, that's just going to depend a lot on what happens with Waha as we go through next year. And it's really -- it's not absolutely Waha prices. It's the differential between Waha and Gulf Coast versus the cost to transport fairly simple. If there's a $2, if -- I use fake numbers, if there's a $2.50 spread, and there's a dollar cost to transport, then you're making $1.50 on nearly 750 million cubic feet a day that we buy and transport to the Gulf Coast. And if it will all depend on what are those spreads for 2025, and as we've experienced here in 2024, they can be extremely volatile. Even over short periods of time, like for a weekend, we can find for a weekend, prices can go negative for three or four days as much negative as like negative $5, which means when we're purchasing gas over the weekend, people are paying us $5 to take to take gas and then we transport it for our transport costs, which we can't disclose, but you could probably figure out what it is, and we sell that on the Gulf Coast for what would normally be a positive price, a little less volatile pricing on Gulf Coast than you get on at Waha.
Betty Jiang: It's certainly nice to have that pipeline right now. Just to clarify, the Gulf Coast benchmark are you looking at Houston share, or it's a combination of different hubs?
John Christmann : Yes. It's -- it would be looking at mainly ship channel or depending on where the pipe takes you back to.
Betty Jiang: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
John Christmann : You bet. Thank you, buddy.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon with TPH & Company. Please proceed.
Jeoffrey Lambujon : Good morning guys, and thanks for squeezing me in here. Really just a quick follow-up to your commentary on the North Sea. A couple of questions ago, just around the free cash flow generation that you mentioned. Can you also help us understand what your outlook is for OpEx from that asset as production declines in the next year, or will just kind of help us dominate it along with the ARO dynamic that you already walked through. Thanks.
Steve Riney : Yes. We'll probably go into more detail on that in the February call. We're just not -- at this point in time, we're -- like we say, we normally at this time of year, give a view to the capital program and production volumes and the general overall direction of the company. And that, as we've highlighted with this conversation is generally dominated by the longer-term oil price outlook. So that's all we really typically look to accomplish on the November call. We'll give more details around country-by-country specifics, and the line items between revenues and LOE and breakdown of capital and things like that in February. I can tell you, though, that the North Sea because of the situation we're in, in the North Sea, and we talk about it openly that we're in the business now managing operations -- day-to-day operations for free cash flow now. We -- practically any type of capital investment is not economic under the current situation. And so we manage that for free cash flow, and we will look hard at operating costs, and we are looking hard at operating costs. We never do so in a way that sacrifices or puts at risk, either human safety or the environment, but there's a lot of stuff that we spend money on that could be looked at and examined just to make sure that we're spending properly in an environment where we're just focused on free cash flow for the remaining life of the asset. So we'll get into more detail of that in the February call.
Jeoffrey Lambujon : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And with that, I will close the Q&A session for today and turn it back to John Christmann, our CEO, for closing remarks.
John Christmann : Yes. Thank you. And first of all, I want to apologize for the Internet disconnect that we had during Paul's question. But in closing, as we've outlined, we've made great progress on the portfolio, and the assets are performing at a very, very high level. We have significantly scaled and streamlined our Permian unconventional position. We're adding a potentially very valuable gas program in Egypt and now have a clear time line to significant production and cash flow in Suriname. Going into 2025, we are looking at a potentially softer oil price environment and are focused on sustaining our core business, reducing costs and generating free cash flow. We provided an early look at a plan of eight rigs in the Permian and 12 rigs in Egypt, which should broadly sustain oil volumes at reduced capital levels. We will continue to work this plan and look forward to coming back to you in February with a lot more details. Thank you for joining us.
Operator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-01 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to APA Corporation's Second Quarter Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Gary Clark: Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's second quarter 2024 Financial and Operational Results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO John Chrisman. Steve Riney, President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Tracy Henderson, Executive Vice President of Exploration, and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations. Our prepared remarks will be less than 15 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss on today's call. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. Please note that the Callon acquisition closed on April 1st. Accordingly, our full year 2024 guidance reflects first quarter APA results on a standalone basis, plus three-quarters of APA and Callon combined. And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Christmann : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call today, I will review APA's second quarter performance, discuss the Callon integration, and review our activity plan and production expectations for the remainder of 2024. Our second quarter results were strong across the board, with higher-than-expected production in all three operational areas. CapEx was lower than expected mostly due to timing of spend. In the U.S., oil volumes of 139,500 barrels per day were up 67% from the first quarter as we incorporated Callon into our operations. Production and costs were significantly better than expected on a BOE basis after adjusting for asset sales and discretionary natural gas and NGL curtailments. Our Permian Basin continues to perform at a high level and we marked our sixth quarter in a row of meeting or exceeding U.S. oil production guidance. On a BOE basis, oil now comprises 46% of our total U.S. production following the Callon transaction. With this increased exposure, APA's cash flow sensitivity to a $5 per barrel change in oil price is approximately $300 million annually. In Egypt, production also exceeded expectations. We saw positive contribution from new wells, improved results from recompletions, and continued strong base production. Base production is particularly benefiting from the implementation of several new water injection projects. We are also beginning to see a decrease in offline oil volumes waiting on workover as we moderate the drilling rig count to free up work over rig resources. Turning to the North Sea, operations were relatively smooth in the second quarter with better than forecast facility runtime driving higher production. Our ongoing focus in the North Sea is right sizing our cost structure for late life operations. In Suriname, our partner Total recently announced that it has secured the FPSO hole for our first offshore development and we remain on track for FID before year end and first oil in 2028. And in Alaska, we are still working through options for the upcoming winter drilling season and look forward to returning to exploration activities. Turning now to the Callon acquisition, note that in last night's release we increased our estimate of annual Callon cost synergies from $225 million to $250 million as we leverage economies of scale of the combined APA and Callon Permian businesses. Steve will speak in more detail about some of the specific initiatives driving these cost reductions. More importantly, we are just beginning to implement drilling unit design and operational changes that we expect will create substantial value on the Callon acreage via improved well performance and capital efficiency. Our preliminary estimate is that we can drill a standardized two-mile lateral for roughly $1 million less than Callon was spending in 2023. We recently spud our first APA designed drilling unit on Callon acreage, the five well Coleman unit in the Midland Basin and should begin to see initial flow-back results in the fourth quarter. Turning now to our activity plans and outlook for the second half of 2024. In yesterday's release we provided guidance for the third and fourth quarters which contained some notable positives. In the U.S. we will average nine to 10 rigs for the remainder of this year consisting of approximately five rigs in the Delaware and four rigs in the Midland. We plan to run three to four frac crews and complete about 90 wells by year end. This sets the stage for strong oil growth in the second half of the year. Accordingly, we are increasing fourth quarter U.S. oil guidance to 150,000 barrels per day which is up 1,500 barrels per day after adjusting for the impact of asset sales closed in June. This represents organic production growth of roughly 8% compared to the second quarter. We also expect an increase in natural gas and NGL production driven primarily by fewer discretionary curtailments than in the first half of the year. In Egypt we expect a continuation of the operational progress that we made in our second quarter. There will be some volume impacts from the rig count decrease but this should be mitigated by strong base production performance and increased workover capacity to remediate wells offline. By year end, we project that backlogged oil production will be closer to more normalized operating levels. On our May call, we said that adjusted production in Egypt would remain relatively flat in 2024, while gross oil production would be flat to slightly down through the remainder of the year. While there are a number of moving parts to the program in Egypt, we see no material variances to our May outlook, and therefore guidance is unchanged. Similarly, our full year production guidance in the North Sea is unchanged, though we now expect a bit larger decrease in third quarter volumes associated with maintenance and turnaround activity at Barrel, and a slightly larger subsequent rebound in the fourth quarter. In closing, second quarter was an excellent quarter operationally, and we continue to execute at a high level in the Permian Basin. We are realizing greater than expected cost savings from the Callon acquisition, and have a clear pathway and plan to improving capital efficiency on those assets. Egypt also had a very good quarter and is beginning to deliver significant capital efficiency improvements. Though our drilling rig count is coming down, continued strength in base production and the return of wells offline will help sustain volumes in the near term. At current strip pricing, the second half of the year is setting up to deliver a substantial increase in free cash flow compared to the first half. And lastly, I am very proud of our teams for delivering these results while remaining on track to achieve our safety and environmental goals for the year. For a detailed review of APA's safety and environmental performance, I encourage you to review our recently published 2024 Sustainability Report, which can be accessed via our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Riney: Thank you, John. For the second quarter, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, APA reported consolidated net income of $541 million, or $1.46 per diluted common share. As usual, these results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which were a $216 million after-tax gain on divestitures and $98 million of after-tax charges for transaction reorganization and separation costs, mostly associated with the Callon acquisition. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the second quarter was $434 million, or $1.17 per share. During the first half of the year, we generated roughly $200 million of free cash flow and returned $311 million to shareholders, nearly half of which consisted of share repurchases. That's a lot compared to the $200 million of free cash flow, but we liked buying at those share prices, and we anticipate free cash flow will be much higher in the second half of the year. That said, the balance sheet remains an important priority, and I will talk about plans for further debt reduction in a few minutes. Now let me turn to progress on the Callon integration. As John noted, we increased our estimate of annual synergies to $250 million. Since we announced the Callon acquisition, we have categorized synergies into three buckets, overhead, cost of capital, and operational. We are now increasing our estimate of expected annual overhead synergies to $90 million. Most of this was captured by the end of the quarter on a run rate basis, and the remainder will be done by year end. At this time, we anticipate that our quarterly core G&A run rate as we enter next year will be approximately $110 million. With that, we will have eliminated about 75% of Callon overhead cost, so no material further synergies are likely. Our cost of capital synergy estimate of $40 million annually assumed terming out Callon's $2 billion debt at APA's lower long-term cost of borrowing. At the closing, we used cash from the revolver and a $1.5 billion three-year term loan to refinance this debt. Instead of terming this debt out, our current intention is to use asset sales and free cash flow to simply pay off the loan before the end of its three-year term. This would represent a significant step forward in the goal to strengthen the balance sheet and to fully realize these synergies. Lastly, we are increasing our operational synergies to $120 million annually, approximately 60% of which is associated with capital savings and 40% attributable to LOE. To reiterate, these cost synergies do not include capital productivity benefits associated with uplifting type curves and improving well economics through spacing, landing zone optimization and frac size. We believe this will be a source of material long-term value accretion. Turning to our 2024 outlook. John has already discussed our activity plans and production guidance, so I will just add a few items of note. We now expect that our original full year capital guidance of $2.7 billion may start trending down a bit. A number of factors could contribute to this, including further synergy capture from the Cowen combination, lower service costs, improving capital efficiency and potential minor reductions in the planned activity set, mostly in the U.S. For purposes of third quarter U.S. BOE production guidance, we are estimating further Permian gas curtailments of 90 million cubic feet per day. This would also result in the curtailment of 7,500 barrels per day of NGLs. As most of you are aware, our income from third-party oil and gas purchased and sold can change significantly from quarter-to-quarter. This is primarily driven by the volatility and differentials between Waha and Gulf Coast gas pricing regardless of the absolute pricing levels. It's important to note that APA's gas marketing and transportation activities are generally more profitable when Waha gas price differentials are wider. For example, the Waha differential was very wide in the second quarter. While Gulf Coast gas prices averaged around $1.65, Waha gas prices averaged closer to negative $0.34. Because of the nearly $2 differential income from our third-party marketing and transportation activities was well above expectations. At current strip gas pricing, we expect a similar dynamic in the third quarter. Accordingly, we are raising our full year estimate of income from third-party oil and gas purchased and sold by $120 million to around $350 million. Approximately half of the full year estimate is attributable to the Cheniere gas supply contract and half is attributable to our marketing and transportation activities. Lastly, APA is now subject to the U.S. alternative minimum tax. And accordingly, we are introducing new guidance for current U.S. tax accruals of $95 million for the year. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Leggate of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Doug Leggate: So I guess there are so many things on the quarter that I could go after. I'm going to just try a couple. But Steve, it looks to us that your CapEx run rate exit, call it, fourth quarter, it looks like you're going to be around $600 million, which would be about a 10% decline year-over-year, if that held into 2025. Is the objective after you grow, you got the momentum from Callon, is your objective to hold that flat in which case should we be thinking something around 2.4, 2.5 [ph] for next year?
Steve Riney: Yes, Doug, I'd be careful just using fourth quarter. We're probably going to be a little completion activity in the fourth quarter because a lot of that is -- has been bunch into second quarter and third quarter this year just because of the timing of availability of wells for completion. So I think the easier way to do that would be to look at full year spend, take out the first quarter, which is just APA and then I would probably first adjust that for the exploration spend and then just divide it by three quarters because the quarter was high third quarter is going to be about average-ish and fourth quarter is probably going to be a little low. And then I think you'll get a number of something close to around $700 per quarter.
Doug Leggate: Okay. All right. That's really helpful, guys. And then we'll get a chance to...
Steve Riney: Sorry. If you take out the exploration, you'll probably get something closer to $675 million a quarter of capital spend on basically the U.S. onshore and Egypt. There's not a whole lot of capital activity, as you know, going on in the North Sea.
Doug Leggate: Okay. That's what I was trying to get a run rate. So that's really helpful. John, I wonder if you've not wanted to be drawn on inventory depth since the Callon deal, but I'm guessing you're getting your hands around that now. So when you look at the drilling pace with, I guess, you're going to be at nine rigs in the second half. What are you thinking with the up-spacing and so on? What are you thinking about your inventory debt looks like now in the lower 48, and I'll leave it there?
John Christmann : Yes, Doug, it's a great question. It's 1 we're working every day. What I would say is if you look at the existing U.S. Permian run rate. We've always said kind of end of the decade with the rig rate we're at. And when we said we're bringing Callon in pretty similar duration I think there's one upside on the Callon is that we can drive the productivity improvements that we think we can then there will be more inventory that comes into play that we did not pay for in our acquisition. So that's something we're currently working on. If you look at where we sit today, we've got a lot of flexibility going into next year. We're going to grow Permian a very strong clip from second quarter to fourth quarter on 9 to 10 rigs, about 8%. And so it gives us a lot of flexibility going into next year pace we want to go. And we've had plenty of inventory that we have visibility on that to carry us to the end of the decade. And we'll keep working that.
Steve Riney: Yes. Just to add on, Doug, to what John just said, just to enhance that a bit. When we were working on the acquisition, of course, we are looking at a lot of outside service providers that look at inventory counts. And most of them probably would have said that Callon had more running room, more inventory, more years of inventory than we did based on our analysis, as John said, which is a fairly conservative view of the world. We said now it's probably more similar to ours in duration. And as John indicated, or we can get capital efficiency, capital productivity into the right place on the Callon acreage, the more that inventory quantum could grow back to what some of the other people thought it was, which is something that would extend beyond the end of this decade.
Doug Leggate: Thanks guys. See you next week.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Freeman of Raymond James. Your line is now open.
John Freeman : Good morning, guys. Just kind of following up on some of Doug's questions. I mean, the Permian and Egypt both exceeding guidance and specifically on Egypt, a pretty solid job of getting that turned around. And I'm just trying to make sure that I'm thinking about this right, where you've got you averaged 16 rigs in the first half of the year, you're going to drop down to 11 rigs in the second half of the year. And -- am I kind of reading it right that even at that lower rate cadence in the second half of the year because of all the steps that you all outlined in terms of the improved kind of base production management, catching up on the recompletion, resolving kind of that backlog of oil off-line in the back half of the year. Is that 11 rigs sort of cadence in the second half of the year? I mean, is that like an acceptable number to kind of maintain volumes? Just trying to make sure I understand kind of the moving pieces.
John Christmann : No, it's a great question, John, and you're on the right track. I'd say that the benefit we've had by dropping the rigs is, it's been able to free up the workover rig time, which is critical because we have a lot of recompletion. And really, we also have a lot of CTIs, which are conversion to injection projects that we've been able to get to. And so when we were running two workover rigs and 18 drilling rigs. There's not much slack by ratcheting that back, it's freeing up the time and it's letting us get to some very meaningful projects that are making a huge impact. Is 11 rigs. This year, we kind of guided to flat to slightly down, is 11% the right number. It's early to tell on that front. But having gotten back from Egypt, there's also a lot of other projects that we're talking to Egypt about, for example, some gas drilling and other things, too, which could be pretty impactful as well. So there's a lot of flexibility there. And we'll be working through that as we work through our planning sectors.
John Freeman: Great. And then just my follow-up, John, you mentioned that you might -- you'd see the gas volumes on the U.S. side actually grow some, and it had to do with sort of the -- well, one of the drivers was the fact that you had less curtailed gas volumes potentially in 4Q. So in the current guidance, does it assume any curtailments in 4Q? I mean, obviously, you all -- you had some in 2Q, you have even more in 3Q. I'm just trying to get something that's built into that full year guidance?
John Christmann : Today fourth quarter does not have any curtailments built in. But obviously, we had up the third quarter with September with were Waha sets.
Steve Riney: Yes. And just second quarter actuals, the amount that was curtailed, we had 78 million cubic feet per day of gas and 7,6000 barrels of NGLs curtailed during the quarter on an average day, that's nearly 21,000 BOEs per day. Our forecast for third quarter, what we've effectively left out of our guidance is 90 million cubic feet per day of gas and 7,500 barrels of NGLs. That's 22,500 BOEs per day. Those are really large numbers as you might imagine.
John Freeman: Appreciate guys. Nice quarter.
Operator: One moment for our next question, which comes from Neal Dingmann of Truist. Your line is now open.
Neal Dingmann : Good morning, guys. Nice update. John, maybe sticking with -- on the Permian or the Callon -- specifically, the Callon acreage development. Really just wondering here, you all talked about, I think, pretty openly potentially up space a little bit. I'm just wondering besides potentially future of spacing. Is there any sort of material other changes either on the completion or other side going forward, you could see potentially doing at this point?
John Christmann : Yes. As I said in the prepared remarks that one of the advantages to is we're seeing impacts on the combined business just from the supply chain how we design the wells, we think we can drill a standard 2-mile lateral for about $1 million less than what Callon was spending last year, which is 20%. So we're anxious to see those numbers start to come through. But excited about what we're seeing. And quite frankly, we're just now starting to spud some of the Apache plan pads on the Callon acreage. So excited to see those results, but things are going extremely well on the integration side.
Steve Riney: Yes. The only thing I would add to that on the completion side, with the Callon drilled wells or Callon spud wells since they were spaced quite a bit tighter than we hold space than -- we haven't really changed the profit loading much on those. We did on a few, but not many. But we significantly increased the fluid loading on those fracs. As we get to our wells, the ones that we drill, obviously, both proppant and fluid loading will be quite a bit larger.
Neal Dingmann: Great. Great. And then maybe Steve for you. Just a second question on shareholder return. Specifically, your shareholder return continues to be quite active. I think it was down a little bit sequentially in this last quarter. I'm just wondering, can we anticipate a large step-up for many of the year? Or how would you like to think about the program for the remainder '24 to '25?
Steve Riney: I tend to think of that on an annual basis, a calendar year basis, we've got at least 6% of free cash flow through dividends and through share buybacks, both with April 1 acquisition using shares, the outlook of dividends and for free cash flow finished quite a bit. But the framework doesn't change 60% at a minimum. We're obviously way ahead of that in the first half of the year. And we'll see what the second half brings. I think we've demonstrated in the past that we're not afraid to go over well over the 60% mark. But let's -- we also recognize there's continued need for balance sheet strengthening after the acquisition. And so we're going to -- we'll balance that on a by quarter, really day-by-day basis. We'll see where we are as we go from one year to the next.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.
Charles Meade : Good morning, John and Steve, the rest APA team there. I'm wondering, you kind of -- maybe you didn't surprise the whole market, we surprised a few people at least with these last couple of asset sales. And I'm curious if you can share or you might want to share what is next? And I guess I'm thinking most prominently about the Central Basin platform, which is an asset or an area that we don't really talk about much anymore, and it doesn't seem like you guys are deploying capital there.
John Christmann : No, Charles. I mean, we typically wait to talk about property sales. But there's a chance, there's other things that we're looking at that are not core to us in places that we're not putting capital. So you may have some decent intel out there.
Charles Meade: Fair enough. And then I have a question about the shut-ins and the marketing in the Permian. As I think about how I would manage that the production, given that you have that valuable firm transport to the coast, I would -- I guess, I'm surmising that, that 90 million a day and 7,500 barrels of NGLs is that essentially all of your dry gas and some of your liquids-rich gas? Or is -- are you -- is there more that you could curtail if that basis got wider?
Steve Riney: Yes, Charles. So there's -- yes, we can we can actually curtail quite a bit more than that, a little more than twice that amount. And so what that is, is that's an average for the quarter, but it's in anticipation of there being periods of time where we're where we're curtailing quite a bit of gas and dipping into the rich gas well especially do that when price of negative or significantly negative. When prices are just low, we'll typically just go with the lean gas and not dip into the richer gas. So we do that based on a price basis. We do it -- we have specific prices where we moved from 1 tranche to another. We've got 4 specific tranches of gas going from lean to richer gas that we can shut in different pricing mechanisms. And so I just want to -- I want to make sure that we're really clear about one fact, and that is that the curtailment of gas volumes in the Permian Basin and the Alpine High in particular, is totally independent of our marketing activities because marketing is something that we have to do because we have firm transport on two large pipelines, more pipelines now with Callon. And we have to fulfill those transport obligations. And we do that with purchased gas in the Permian Basin, which we then sell on the Gulf Coast. And we have various access points both in the Permian and on the Gulf Coast to be able to buy and sell that gas. So we don't have a choice of doing that. If we choose not to transport gas, we have to pay the transport fee anyway.
Charles Meade: It's a nice piece of business. Thanks for that detail, Steve.
Operator: Our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
Roger Read : Hey, good morning. I'd like to maybe follow up on some of your discussions on Egypt, just to understand, where is the decision coming from on the switch from drilling to workovers? Is that all the partners? Is that your decision? Is it Egypt's decision? And then how should we think about that maybe reversing as we exit '24 into '25 to the extent you can offer any sort of guidance that way.
John Christmann : Well, I mean, we have a joint venture there. We have a one-third partner with Sinopec, but we never have issues in terms of directionally what we think is the right thing to do and we have full support. And I think the good news is the performance has been strong. The projects are very impactful. And it just shows that getting that workover rig and drilling rig balance into play really gives us a lot more flexibility. I would just say there's -- it would be our choice in terms of adding activity, and there is flexibility to do that. And we're recently over there, met with President Sisi, met with some of his new cabinet members, very impressed with the new minister and excited to work with him, and outlined some frameworks under which we could think about bringing on some other volumes of things. So very constructive meetings, and it's just something we'll factor in as we go into the planning process.
Roger Read: Okay. I appreciate that. And then just to come back around on the Callon integration, understand the changes in the synergies and all. But if you were to -- just give us an idea in the old baseball terms or football game quarters or whatever, as you think about the integration and the understanding of what Callon really brings to the Apache family, -- like are we early, we mid, are we late in the process of really kind of understanding all that?
John Christmann : Yes. I think it's probably more like going through fall camp. There's phases that get ahead early and phases that you're still developing, right? But in terms of the organization and so forth, we've worked through that very quickly with the integration of the assets into the portfolio. We worked through that quickly. Obviously, the piece that's the most exciting is still to come is going to be what can we drive on the productivity improvements and what does that do in terms of inventory locations. So we're just now getting to the first pads and spudding our first Apache plant wells. And obviously, anxious to get on with those results.
Steve Riney: Yes, I'd characterize it using the baseball analogy. I think going through the synergies and going through the headcount and all of that, getting the organization integrated, that's kind of the pre-game warm up. And as John said, we've just drilled our first well out here on Callon acreage. So I would say that we're at back the first inning, and we haven't taken the first pitch yet. So it's just starting. Game is just beginning.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Hanold of RBC. Your line is now open.
Scott Hanold : I was wondering if we could pivot to Suriname. And what are your high-level thoughts on how you look at activity maybe spending in 2025? I know it may be a bit early and your partner has an upcoming Analyst Day and that we're going to get more color there. But what is your understanding at this point?
John Christmann : Scott, I mean, we've been pretty consistent since this time last year that the -- after we finish the Krabdagu appraisal that we were highly confident we were going to have a project, and we stated we plan to have an FID by year-end '24. And obviously, we remain on track. It's consistent with the message that Total has now put out. I think that is the next step. And once we get to that step, then we can obviously talk a lot more about what that means and all of that, but things are going extremely well. Teams are working very well together, and they are doing their thing. So right now, I'd say we remain on track for year-end FID and first of all by 2028, and they're working hard to accelerate those.
Scott Hanold: Okay. Understood. And my follow-up question is back to kind of the Permian inventory runway. You talked about being confidence at the end of the decade at this point in time. Do you all think that's a strong enough position? And so what I'm trying to get to is like what is your appetite for further consolidation? Do you feel comfortable with that position now? Or are there other opportunities there for you?
John Christmann : Today, we feel very comfortable with where we sit. I mean -- and when we talk about inventory, we're talking about long laterals with extremely high PIs. So it's high-quality inventory. As you know, we've got a large acreage footprint in the Permian. We're always working on how we bring more acreage into drillable prospects, but it just takes time as you mark through and you've got a lot of tests along the way. But today, we're very comfortable with our inventory. We know there's a lot more inherently to do there, and we will get to that and improve that as time goes on. I think when it comes to transactions and things, you've got to continue to have a very high bar. We've had one. We've been very patient. We saw a lot of opportunity in Callon, which is why we moved on it. But today, we're very content with where we sit and believe that there will be even more to do than what we have visibility into today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Bob Brackett : Good morning. A bit of a follow-up on Suriname. Two interesting things that I interpret from your update. One is you all have gone out and with the partner secured a state-of-the-art slot on FPSO from a leading contractor, that's about the most expensive long lead item I can think of. Does that tell for your conviction in FID or am I overreaching?
John Christmann : Bob, I think we've been really confident we'd have a project, right? So -- but we still need to get to FID. So it just tells you the seriousness the time line that they're looking to accelerate. But it's -- they did declare commerciality earlier this year. We just got a lot of work technical work it takes to get to an FID decision. But we've said year-end, and I wouldn't change that now. We just know we're trying to accelerate that.
Bob Brackett: And then the second issue is you've disclosed that the field development area is agreed upon for kind of a joint Sapakara Krabdagu development. If I sharpen my crayon and draw a ring fence around Sapakara through Krabdagu I could capture the vast majority of all your discoveries out there, ring-fence that? And then under the PSE cost recover that and have a pretty good cost pool for future work? Am I thinking correctly there?
John Christmann : I would just say when we talk about Sapakara, it's pretty much the fine field as we have it defined today. When we talked about appraising Krabdagu, we talked about appraising a fairway and seismically driven, right? And so -- and if you go back to the comments when we announced the Krabdagu appraisal wells, we said that not only did it confirm and appraise Krabdagu, but it obviously derisked a lot of other prospects. So at this point, let's -- the next step will be an FID, and we need to get there. But you're definitely starting to think about things directionally in the right way.
Bob Brackett: Good thing. And I'll just throw a last one in, which is to say, you guys increased your acreage in Alaska by 20%, that suggests that you see something interesting there or perhaps the option value of that acreage is pretty low. Is that a good way to think of it?
John Christmann : I would just say we're excited about Alaska. The King Street Discovery is -- it's proof of concept. It proves the play that we're chasing sits 80 to 90 miles east of where it's been proven. So we're in a good area. We said it was a high-quality discovery oil, high-quality sands. So we are anxious to get back and continue exploring in Alaska in the near future.
Bob Brackett: Thanks for that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Leo Mariani from ROTH. Your line is now open. Q - Leo Mariani I wanted to quickly follow up here on Egypt. So I know you reiterated your comments from May where you thought that gross oil would be flat to slightly down, Egypt certainly noticed that gross oil in the second quarter was up a little bit versus the first quarter. Just trying to get a sense. I know that the rig count is coming down a little bit in the second half, but do you think you can maybe hold that second quarter gross oil run rate in Egypt? Or do you think it's more likely that it comes down by the end of the year with some of the lower rig activity?
John Christmann : Yes. I would just say we'll stick to what we said in the script. Clearly, second quarter was strong. Things are going well in Egypt. But at this point, we didn't see any reason to alter our guidance.
Leo Mariani : Okay. Any update on the receivable situation there in Egypt that you guys can share?
John Christmann : I'd say it just got back from being over there. As I said, I had a good meeting with the President got to meet some of his new cabinet. Things are going well in Egypt. I mean, I think if you step back and look at it, President Sisi has done a really good job of managing a fairly difficult situation. So we've been impressed with that. We have been receiving some payments this year. So all in all, things are going well, and they continue to work through a difficult situation, but we see no reason to be concerned at this point and a lot of positive things on numerous fronts. Steve?
Steve Riney: Yes. The only thing I would add to that, John, is that the new Minister of Petroleum as a set of priorities and high on that list of priorities, just to get the oil companies paid off. And we sit on all of that with him as well. And he's serious about his list of one of his anxious to get started on this.
Leo Mariani : Okay. That's really helpful. And you guys intimated in your comments that there could be some opportunities from additional gas there. I know Egypt has been short gas this summer. It sounds like they're a little desperate to get back at it. Would you anticipate some opportunities and then potentially that could be associated with the price change on some of the gas going forward?
John Christmann : Yes. I would just say, historically, we have explored for oil in the West Desert, and we're mainly focused on oil. We do produce a lot of gas. We had a very large discovery in case a couple of decades ago. There is gas in the Western Desert and we've had some conversations about what it would take to maybe go after some gas projects that could be helpful to the country. So it's something that we're discussing with them. But it's early. And obviously, you'd probably look at something that made more economic sense at the higher price for future gas exploration. But it's early, but definitely something that could come into play in the future.
Leo Mariani: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Scott Gruber : Yes, good morning. I wanted to come back to the upside on the Callon acreage. So as we think about the productivity improvement potential from up spacing and the completion redesign, will there be a material improvement in 30-day IPs? Or will the improvement to manifest more over time in the six and 12-month cubes? I'm just wondering if the shift in the completion design targets a shallower decline and what that means for the 30-day IP improvement potential versus the longer-term improvement potential.
John Christmann : Yes. Scott, we just need to get some down. But I mean, obviously, with the changes we'd be looking at, we're pumping a lot more fluid. I think you could see increases there, but also with a little wider spacing, you should see better longer-term performance. So we just need to get some wells down and talk from delivered results at this point, so -- which we're getting on to and anxious to demonstrate.
Scott Gruber: Okay. Okay. And then just another follow-up on Egypt. So you guys spent about $135 million a quarter, running 16 rigs on average in the first half, and that will drop to 11% in the second half. Roughly how much will the fiber reduction drop Egyptian CapEx in FDU?
Steve Riney: Yes. I don't have that number to hand. It should be relatively proportional, but we're running workover rigs and that some of that work is capital as well, and that doesn't change. So you could probably get with Gary, he could give you see some data on that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan Securities LLC. Your line is now open.
Arun Jayaram: Good morning. John and Steve, I wanted to get your thoughts on how should we start thinking about spending in 2025, you mentioned maybe a run rate of $675 million per quarter heading into next year. And I was wondering, as we think about some of your exploration activities in Alaska as well as assuming an FID at Suriname. I was wondering if you could maybe help us think about maybe a placeholder for CapEx for areas outside of your base D&C program.
Steve Riney: Yes. So first of all, let me make sure I was clear about the $675 million. That was a number that was -- it was about 2024 capital spending. And I was -- how do you get a -- it was a conversation about how do you get a grip on how much are we actually spending on a run rate basis with the current structure of the company with Callon included as well exploration, excluding exploration activity. And so that's what the $675 million was that's about how much we're spending on average between second, third and fourth quarter of 2024. If you exclude Suriname and Alaska exploration type of activity. As far as -- and so the point being that, that was not an indication that that's what our run rate is going to be going into 2025. Just to be clear about that. I think the best thing that we can do as we normally do is we're in the middle of the planning process right now. The great thing about our portfolio, John mentioned earlier, we've got a huge amount of optionality. It's a complex portfolio actually. And you've got to make a lot of capital allocation decisions with looking view of where you would be allocating capital where the best returns are going to be through other parts and so that's what we typically run our planning process starting in mid-summer through the fall. We have an upcoming conversation with the Board about that plan, a preview of that plan. And we've got a process that we run through. We typically in November, give a high-level view of what 2025 will look like. And then all of the details we typically give in February.
John Christmann : The other thing I was going to say, Arun, if you look at what Steve was saying on the $675 million, Permian is actually growing at about 8% in the back half of this year. So there's a lot of room in terms of moderating if we choose to what is the right plan going into next year. And that's a lot of what we'll put into the decision-making process.
Steve Riney: Yes. Yes, that's a great quarter, John. A lot of people talk about, well, okay, what's it takes to run flat going into 2025? And we had a little bit of a conversation about that around Egypt. We're running 11 rigs, can you hold flat -- Egypt flat with 11 rigs and we're down to 11 rigs because we had to create the workover capacity to get back at the -- to get us to recompletions and workover backlog, and we're also using that time to do some convert to injection for water injection on a number of these fields. So can 11 rigs hold Egypt flat? Maybe not. It might be a little low, but we were running 18 rigs earlier this year, and running flat in Egypt is much closer to 11 rigs than it is to '18. '18 was clearly more than we needed to be running in Egypt. And as John said, in the Permian, we're running 9 to 10 rigs for the second half of the year, and we're growing 8% from second quarter to fourth quarter. So clearly, the number is below that in terms of how many rigs do you have to run in the Permian to stay flat.
Arun Jayaram: Great. And just my follow-up. This year's financial is obviously benefiting from weak Waha prices and your ability to arbitrage that along the Gulf Coast. Steve, how do you think about maybe a more normalized earnings picture for that midstream, call it, piece when you have Matterhorn on and maybe some other pipes. So just wanted to think about how you think about kind of the normalized earnings potential there.
Steve Riney: Well, I don't know what normalized is anymore after the last several quarters. But in general, market dynamics would tell you that a balanced situation would be that differentials between Waha and Gulf Coast they need to formalized would be that, that should have over time we're basically just making money on the Permian and by buying something slightly below Waha pricing because we've got multiple receipt points and we can take best price, and we typically do, but you're talking about pennies per Mcf. And then on the Gulf Coast side, multiple delivery points where you can sell for pennies maybe above Houston Ship Channel here or there, and you can squeeze a few pennies out on both ends, but on 674 million cubic feet a day, that makes a difference over time. And it just pays for the transport and fuel costs. But in that oil and gas purchase for resale, remember that still includes the Cheniere contract, which, of course, has nothing to do with Waha differentials.
Arun Jayaram: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from Geoff Jay of Daniel Energy Partners. Your line is now open.
Geoff Jay: Hey guys. Just wanted to get some clarification on the DMC savings you guys talked about. I mean kind of $100 a foot for a colon 2-mile, I guess those are like $72 million of the total synergy. Just wondering kind of if you can give me any more granularity about what's in there? And are there any service cost deflation numbers in that figure?
John Christmann : Yes. So what we've included in the $150 million of annualized synergies excludes the benefit of lower rig rates for frac. Exactly [technical difficulty] have some integrity and [technical difficulty] synergies of a transaction [technical difficulty]. That is excluding any market synergies. So while John talked about $1 million cheaper or lower cost to drill a single well -- that includes the market benefit, but we only took about 70% of that number because 30% of that is the -- some of the market benefits on steel, on rigs, on frac and other things. What is included in the $250 million is about $60 million of annualized run rate for the lower drilling costs on these wells. And what that $60 million is, is basically with 9 to 10 rigs running in the Permian Basin, that's about how many Callon wells we would drill in a given year. And so that's how we got to that number. We're are obviously not drilling 60 wells this year. So we're not -- it's not like we're going to capture a full $60 million of benefit in the calendar year '24. But if we keep running at a similar rate that we're running these days, then we'll probably capture something near that in 2025.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Your line is now open.
Paul Cheng: Just one quick one. Alaska, John, can you share with us that what's the drilling trend over there? I mean, how many wells you guys are going to drill whether it's all exploration or is going to be doing some appraisal on the King Street? And what -- how much spending that we may be talking about? Thank you.
John Christmann : Yes, Paul, it's early. I mean we're working through plans with a partner. So at this point, no update on Alaska, specifically for plans other than that, we will be doing some more drilling up there.
Paul Cheng: Okay, all right. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to John Christmann, CEO for closing remarks.
John Christmann : Thank you, and to wrap up really, just a couple of points here. Number one, we're delivering strong results in the Permian and the Callon integration is going extremely well. Secondly, freeing up the workover rigs in Egypt is letting us do two things, one, implementing some very impactful water flood initiatives. Two, reducing the backlog of wells waiting for workover recompletion and the results of both of those are very visible. And lastly, we are raising full year oil production guidance while seeing a downward bias to our full year capital. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-02 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the APA Corporation's First Quarter 2024 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker for today, Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. 
Gary Clark: Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's First Quarter 2024 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO, John Christmann. Steve Riney, President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Tracey Henderson, Executive Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations. Our prepared remarks will be about 15 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. 
 In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. 
 Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss on today's call. 
 A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. Please note that the first quarter 2024 results reflect APA Corp. only as the Callon acquisition was subsequently closed on April 1. Accordingly, our full year 2024 guidance reflects first quarter APA results on a stand-alone basis, plus 3/4 of APA and Callon combined. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. 
John Christmann: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call today, I will review our first quarter performance, discuss the compelling opportunities we are seeing after the closing of the Callon acquisition and review our activity plan and production expectations for the remainder of 2024. During the first quarter, Upstream capital investment of $568 million was below guidance due primarily to the deferral of some planned facility, leasehold and exploration spend. 
 We continue to deliver excellent results in the Permian Basin with the first quarter marking our fifth consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding U.S. oil production guidance. U.S. oil volumes were up an impressive 16% compared to the first quarter of 2023, and we expect organic growth to continue through the year as we integrate talent. On the natural gas side, we chose to curtail a substantial amount of production at Alpine High, primarily in March in response to extreme Waha basis differentials. This dynamic has continued into the second quarter. 
 In Egypt, gross production was in line with our expectations, while adjusted volumes were just shy of guidance due to the PSC impact of higher-than-planned oil prices. As discussed previously, we are in the process of rebalancing our drilling rig to workover rig ratio in Egypt to further optimize capital efficiency. In the first quarter, we averaged 17 drilling rigs and 21 workover rigs. While the workover rig count will remain flat, we will reduce the drilling rig count over the next 3 quarters, allowing workover rigs to be redirected. 
 The amount of oil production temporarily off-line and waiting on workover remained at around 12,000 barrels per day during the quarter. We expect to make progress on this as the drilling rig count comes down and freeze up workover resources. The challenges we experienced in the fourth quarter 2023 with faulty new electrical submersible pumps have now been fully remediated through vendor change-out and design modifications. 
 Turning to the North Sea. First quarter production was impacted by a decrease in average facility run time at barrel in March. As a reminder, this type of downtime tends to occur more frequently and is less predictable when managing late-life assets like those we have in the North Sea. On the exploration front, we recently concluded our 3-well Alaska exploration drilling program. 
 As a reminder, our 275,000 acre position lies on state lands, roughly 70 to 90 miles east of analogous industry discoveries. Our King Street #1 well confirmed a working petroleum system on our acreage, discovering oil in 2 separate zones. The other 2 wells, Sockeye #1 and Voodoo #1 were unable to reach their target objectives in the allotted seasonal time window due to a number of weather and operational delays. We are currently analyzing all the data and we'll come back later with more commentary on next steps in Alaska. Lastly, in Suriname, we are progressing the FID study on our first development project, which we hope to FID before the end of the year. 
 Turning now to the Callon acquisition, which closed on April 1. We are 1 month into the integration process and are making very good progress. As anticipated, we are finding tremendous opportunities to reduce costs, improve efficiencies, leverage economies of scale and create value by applying our operational expertise and unconventional development workflows to the Callon acreage. 
 Accordingly, we have increased our estimate of annual cost synergies by 50% from $150 million to $225 million. Steve will comment further on the timing and nature of these synergies in his remarks. The most exciting and compelling value capture opportunity we see with Callon still lies ahead. That will come from capital efficiency improvements which will enhance overall development economics and potentially expand the development inventory that form the basis of our transaction value. 
 For the remainder of 2024, we will be revising most of Callon's operational practices and workflows. This includes everything from contracting and logistics to well planning and design, drilling and completions, facility construction and many aspects of daily operations. At a high level, you will see wider well spacing, fewer discrete landing zones and larger fracture stimulations. 
 Improvements in capital efficiency will manifest in fewer wells to deliver the same amount of incremental production volumes. While it will take some time to realize the full benefit of these changes, the implementation has already begun. In the meantime, we are modifying many aspects of Callon's previous 2024 plan to capture as much near-term benefit as possible. 
 Turning now to our activity plans and outlook for 2024. In yesterday's release, we provided guidance for the second quarter and full year 2024, along with our expected oil production rates for the fourth quarter. In the U.S., we have been running 11 rigs in the Permian since April 1. We expect to average approximately 10 for the remainder of this year as we actively manage changes to the combined rig fleet. You will see the rig count change as we drop some rigs when their term ends and pick up other rigs more suitable for the planned drilling program. 
 Similarly, we will be making a number of adjustments to our combined frac schedule. In terms of oil volumes, we noted in our first quarter materials that we expect U.S. oil production in the fourth quarter to be around 152,000 barrels per day which represents an 11% growth rate from our second quarter guide of 137,000 barrels per day. 
 Switching now to Egypt. In February, we commented that adjusted production would remain relatively flat in 2024. Today, we anticipate adjusted production will decrease slightly as a function of the PSC impacts of higher-than-planned oil prices. 
 And in the North Sea, production guidance for the full year is unchanged with an expected dip mostly in the third quarter as we conduct scheduled platform maintenance. In closing, we continue to manage our business with a clear and consistent strategy and deliver on our capital return commitments and financial objectives. The Callon acquisition is complete and the path to value creation is clear and well underway. Post Callon, our Permian Basin unconventional acreage footprint has increased by approximately 45% and our Permian Basin oil production has increased by more than 65%. The Permian Basin will represent an estimated 73% of APA's total company adjusted production in the second quarter and will approximate 75% of our Upstream capital this year. 
 Notably, our oil production weighting in the U.S. will increase to projected 46% in the second quarter from 39% on a stand-alone basis in the first quarter. 
 Finally, Steve will discuss our priorities around debt reduction, but I want to emphasize that our shareholder return framework has not changed, and we will continue to return at least 60% of our free cash flow via dividends and share repurchases. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney. 
Stephen Riney: Thank you, John, and good morning. For the first quarter, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA reported consolidated net income of $132 million or $0.44 per diluted common share. As usual, these results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which was a $52 million after-tax addition to the provision for costs associated with Gulf of Mexico abandonment liabilities. 
 Excluding this and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $237 million or $0.78 per share. The resulting adjusted earnings for the quarter include some significant exploration dry hole expenses, specifically, we took a $59 million charge for the 2 exploration wells in Alaska, which were unable to reach their targets. Additionally, we wrote off the remaining $42 million we were carrying for the Bonboni exploration well in Suriname, which was drilled in 2021, as we now have no active plans for further exploration in the Northern portion of Block 58. 
 The total after-tax impact of these items on adjusted earnings was $88 million or $0.29 per share. In the first quarter, we returned $176 million through dividends and share repurchases. As John indicated, we remain committed to returning a minimum 60% of free cash flow to shareholders. We are also cognizant of the need to strengthen the balance sheet, and we are looking at non-core asset sales as a source of debt reduction in addition to the 40% of free cash flow not designated for shareholder return. 
 Our priorities for debt reduction will be the 3-year term loan we used to refinance the Callon debt and the revolver. Finally, we incurred roughly $20 million of costs associated with the Callon transaction in the first quarter and expect to incur an additional $90 million of such costs. The vast majority of which will be in the second quarter for professional services, departing Callon employees and other closing costs. 
 Now let me turn to progress on the Callon integration. One month into the process, we are on track to realize more cost savings than originally projected. As John noted, we have revised our annual synergies from $150 million up to $225 million. Recall, we put expected synergies into 3 categories: overhead, cost of capital and operational. Annual overhead synergies have been revised up from $55 million to $70 million. This is moving quickly, and we will capture approximately 75% of this on a run rate basis by the end of the second quarter. 
 We expect by year-end, nearly all of these synergies will be realized and our go-forward G&A run rate will be around $110 million per quarter. Expected annual cost of capital synergies are unchanged at $40 million. The initial refinancing of the Callon debt realized a portion of these synergies and they will be fully realized when the debt is termed out or paid off. 
 We are seeing the greatest amount of opportunity in operational synergies. Our original estimate for this category was $55 million, which we have revised upward $115 million. We are making extremely good progress in this area, some of the more impactful items that we are working on include recontracting of frac services in rig high-grading, artificial lift optimization which will lower LOE and reduce downtime, supply chain synergies for casing and tubing, sand, chemicals and other items, compression fleet optimization and economies of scale and well design improvements that eliminate extra casing strings and reduced drilling days. 
 Further down the road, we see additional potential in areas like gas marketing and transportation and water handling disposal and recycling. To reiterate, these cost synergy estimates do not include capital productivity effects associated with improvements in well type curves and economics through well spacing, landing zone optimization and frac size. 
 Turning to our 2024 outlook. John has already discussed our activity plans and production guidance. So I will just touch on a few other items of note. Other than reflecting the Callon acquisition and our outlook, the most material change to guidance is associated with gas pricing in the Permian and its impact on expected near-term production and third-party gas marketing activities. As most of you are aware, Waha experienced severe basis differentials in March and April. We expect this will continue through much of May. 
 As a result, we have continued to curtail gas into the second quarter and our 2Q guidance now reflects an estimated impact on the quarter of 50 million cubic feet per day of gas and 5,000 barrels per day of NGLs related to the weakness at Waha Hub. Our income from third-party oil and gas purchased and sold, including the Cheniere gas supply contract is expected to be around $230 million for the full year which is up significantly from our original guidance of $100 million. You will also see that we have removed DD&A from our guidance at this time. We are still working on the Callon purchase price allocation and aligning our reserve booking practices. We will reinstate DD&A guidance with the second quarter results. 
 Finally, as a reminder, APA will be subject to the U.S. alternative minimum tax starting in 2024. We incurred no AMT in the first quarter and do not expect to in the second quarter. Based on current strip prices, we will likely incur these costs in the second half of the year. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Freeman of Raymond James. Your line is now open. 
John Freeman: The first question I had, just to make sure that I understand sort of the moving parts in Egypt. So last quarter had about 13,000 that was offline. I think normally, I think you all cited that, that would be closer to probably 8,000 -- I'm sorry, 5,000 would normally be offline. So you've worked it down a little bit, and I see how the rigs keep coming down, the workover rig level stays level. But I think historically, John you all said that used to be sort of 2x to 3x the number of workover rigs to drilling rigs. 
 So even as the rig cadence goes down the rest of the year, you still stay well below that level. So maybe just help me understand how you can -- you get that backlog or what's off-line worked down despite still being a good bit below that historical ratio? Like maybe why that historical ratio maybe doesn't apply anymore? Or just any additional color there? 
John Christmann: No, it's a great question. And as you acknowledge, historically, we have run a higher ratio of workover rigs or drilling rigs. Today, we're going to average 13 to 15 on the drilling rig side this year, and we're going to run right at 20 workover rigs. So it's going to take a little bit more time to kind of chisel away at that, but we're on it. It's coming down a little bit. 
 There's also things we're doing with the drilling rigs to be able to complete some wells, which will also help some of that pressure. So it's just going to take a little bit longer, which is why you'll see a gradual move down on that number. 
John Freeman: Got it. And then just shifting gears. Nice to see the 50% increase in the Callon synergies and obviously making a lot of progress on the cost side. You all put out previously a presentation just sort of showing all Permian results relative to legacy -- Callon results. And I guess -- it won't be until 4Q, and we get to see basically wells that you all kind of started design drill completed from the get-go show up in your numbers, and you mentioned some of the things that could drive to the better well productivity, wider spacing, et cetera. 
 Just to be clear, you all guidance just assumes legacy Callon well results right? Like it doesn't assume any uplift. Is that correct in your current guidance? 
John Christmann: Yes. Today, the guidance is what's in front of us, right? And it's going to -- obviously, Callon's drilled a lot of wells. We're immediately making changes on the completion side to the extent we can. But there are more wells drilled per section that we would drill. There are more landing zones. And so we're going to have to pump similar-sized fracs in terms of sand loads. I think the big thing will be changing is the fluid volumes will go up, but we're doing things with -- it's kind of a work in progress, right? 
 We start with what Callon has and we modify what we can and what we think is going to be impactful. And then by the time you get to the fourth quarter, you'll start to see how we plan things and what will be full Apache workflow on that. Just a little color in terms of where the rig count sits and things today. We're running 11 rigs, there's 4 in the Delaware, there's actually 7 in the Midland. We've actually moved 1 of the Callon rigs to some Apache acreage that was ready and kind of plan like we want to drill it. So we've accelerated some there. So it's going to be influx as we work through this. 
 But yes, we're anxious to get to fully Apache planned workflow and execution. And it's going to be a kind of a transition over the next 2 quarters until we get to the fourth quarter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. 
Neal Dingmann: I just had a quick one first on the Permian gas play. It's interesting the acreage and the potential returns there. I'm just wondering what would it take for you to bring some of that back? Is it just strictly it needs to compete against your now more oily play given that Callon and the larger footprint? 
John Christmann: Well, I mean, that is the big driver. It needs to compete internally on the oil side. And really, we measure that through Waha. So right now, you've had very, very weak Waha. Obviously, we've got Matterhorn coming on, but we're going to need to see much stronger Waha and it's going to need to compete internally with our oil projects. 
Neal Dingmann: No, that totally makes sense. And then just, again, maybe last one for you or Steve, just when it comes to shareholder return, you guys have continued and maybe sometime towards the end of the year, stepped a bit more into the buybacks and all. I'm just wondering, will that plan change? Or should we just think sort of more of the same when it comes to shareholder return? 
John Christmann: No. I mean I think big picture. We're committed to the 60%, right? We've shown that it's a minimum of 60%. And we will lean into that when we believe there's weakness, which we've historically done, and we'll continue to do in the future. That gives us the other 40% for debt reduction. We do have some non-core asset sales that we're targeting as we do believe we need to make some progress on the debt side with what we brought on with Callon, but you'll see us aggressively approaching both. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum of TD Cowen. 
David Deckelbaum: I wanted to ask a couple of questions around the capital program this year and your preliminary thoughts getting into '25 as you further integrate the Callon assets. One, can you just talk about, in this year, how many DUCs you're intending to work down and what you would carry going into next year? 
 And as a follow-up to that, if we think about the combined company this year, should we be assuming improved capital efficiencies into next year that would sort of have you on this glide path of combined companies spending in and around $3 billion a year. 
Stephen Riney: Yes. David, this is Steve. So in terms of the capital program and the treatment of DUCs, what we've done is we've added some frac capital in order to come up to the $2.7 billion of capital that we have in the plan for this year now. We basically just combined the final 3 quarters of Callon's remaining capital program with ours. But then we added some frac capital in the second half of the year because we did see that both of us were building DUCs. 
 Now I think it's probably best that we not get into numbers at this point simply because the program is still, I'd say, very much in the flux as you go out towards the back half of the year. We're working our way through it. As John said, we are changing a lot of the activity. There's hardly any activity that's going on, on the Callon acreage later this year that we're not changing from the Callon plan. And so you can imagine after 4 weeks that, that's still a bit in flux. And so maybe we can share some -- a bit more clarity on things like that with the second quarter earnings call in August. I think that would be better just so we can be through a bit of this, and we can solidify the remaining plan for the year. 
 But just as a general statement, we don't believe that it's good capital efficiency in general to be carrying a lot of DUCs. There are some value to having some DUCs and there's some just basic need because of the logistics of matching up frac schedules with drilling schedules, but we don't believe in the capital efficiency of having a tremendous amount of DUC inventory. 
John Christmann: And the only thing I would add is, obviously, we believe the capital productivity will improve on the Callon portion especially as we go to our modifications and our workflows back half of the year. So combined companies going to improve and we're seeing that productivity on the Apache side right now, and we'll get the Callon assets there towards the back half of the year. 
David Deckelbaum: Appreciate that. If I could make those first 2 questions, I guess, into one and ask another one. I'm just curious if you can share any targets that you might have in mind on proceeds or timing from non-core asset sales? 
Stephen Riney: No, we don't have any specific targets in mind. But what we recognize that even after the progress that we made in '21 and '22 on debt, for Apache Corp. We knew that we needed to make more progress and we didn't make as much as we might have wanted to during the intervening time, and we just feel like we need to get on with that and get debt down. And now that we've added some debt through the Callon acquisition, we're going to just try to focus on that this year. We think it's a good time to be doing that. The market seems to be strong for some of these non-core assets and we'll see if we can get some of those off and get some good prices, and they will be focused on debt reduction. 
 We're optimistic about that. We think that it's a good time to be doing that. Ultimately, the -- sorry, ultimately, the target is to get debt to a point where we are kind of a solid BBB type of rating on our debt so that you're not kind of dancing around the edge of investment grade and non-investment grade. And we slid into non-investment grade in 2020 with the massive downturn in oil price and we haven't been able to climb back out of that, even though we're -- we have the metrics of a lot of investment-grade companies. We're still not investment grade with everybody. We've gotten there with 2, but not all 3. 
David Deckelbaum: And do you think there's a path to getting there within the next couple of years? 
Stephen Riney: That's what we're trying to achieve. Yes. I think it's possible, and we're going to certainly give it a try. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Betty Jiang of Barclays. 
Wei Jiang: I really appreciate the color or the guidance that you have given for 4Q pro forma production for U.S. oil. If we think out to 2025, like Apache is delivering double-digit organic growth in the Permian this year. Do you expect to see continued growth on the combined assets going forward? Just thinking about the overall strategy, like approach from a growth outlook perspective? 
John Christmann: Yes. Betty, what I'll say is, as post the Callon merger, our Permian now makes up roughly 75% of the company. And we've been executing at a high rate on the Apache side. We're anxious to provide those workflows on the Callon side. We have added a little bit of capital, which is going to work down some of the DUCs in the fourth quarter of this year. So I mean, it's early to comment on 2025, but it's going to give us a lot of strong momentum as we exit 2024 with a very strong fourth quarter. 
 So we're very anxious to demonstrate that, and we're very confident in what we can deliver from the Permian. 
Stephen Riney: Sorry, Betty. I was just going to add one thing to that. One of the reasons why we added the frac capacity in the second half of this year, number 1 is frac is pretty inexpensive these days. So it's a good time to be doing that. But also just -- with the scale of the operation now that we have in the Permian Basin, as John said, 75% of our company now, with that kind of scale and the amount of activity that we're carrying on, we ought to be able to plan activity to where we don't have these big lulls a big rush of completions and turn-in lines and then a big lull of activity, and we ought to be able to plan it maintaining capital efficiency, but plan it in a way that creates a bit smoother profile to production volume. 
 And that's one of the things that we're trying to achieve as we bring this frac capacity into the back half of this year is to get a little more smoothness to that because we were -- we felt like we may have been setting ourselves up for yet another downturn in first quarter on volume, a little bit of a lull or a flat spot, and we don't need to be doing that, and we can do better than that. 
Wei Jiang: Great. I appreciate that color. Shifting gear to Egypt, a similar question. This year, seeing that growth of Egypt volume is down a little bit, but a lot of that related to the workover rig shortage. If we look out post the PSC contract renegotiation, there was an expectation of Egypt growing the single-digit range. Do you expect to go back to that type of profile. When do you think that asset will be ready to do that? 
John Christmann: Yes. I mean you've got one factor in Egypt is costs are big picture gas has been declining. So the gross BOEs have been declining because of that, and we've been growing the oil. We're in a place today where we're working to rebalance the workover rigs and the drilling rigs and find a good level in there where we can drive that production base. 
 So we'll monitor that over the year and come back later this year with projections in terms of what we'll do next year. And quite frankly, how Egypt continues to compete with what we're doing in the Permian, will play into that as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of ROTH MKM. 
Leo Mariani: I wanted to follow up a little bit here on Egypt. I wanted to just kind of get a sense from you folks what the situation is with the receivables there in country. I saw that Egypt recently got an IMF loan a little bit ago. I'm not sure if that's kind of improved the state financial well-being there. So maybe you could just kind of speak to that? And then also, could you speak a little bit to kind of your expectations for gross Egyptian oil volumes? 
 I know you talked a lot about sort of net, but it looks like growth has come down in the last few quarters. How do you expect growth trajectory on the gross volumes to trade over the next couple of quarters? 
Stephen Riney: Okay. Yes. So sorry, this is Steve. Yes, on receivables. So as we've always said, we worked very closely with the Egyptian Government on things like that. We've received 2 payments during the first quarter of this year. But despite that receivables, especially with oil price and all, receivables increased slightly in the first quarter of 2024. We kind of made good progress through 2023, bringing it down most quarters. 
 It increased slightly in the first quarter of '24, but it's still below the average of where we were last year. But more importantly, I think you hit on the point, I think Egypt is on a very good path right now. They've floated their currency, they devalued it and floated it. And with that, they had to raise interest rates to control inflation. But with that, their bonds are up and the ratings outlook is improving. 
 The IMF loan, as you talked about, they increased their loan program from $3 billion to $8 billion. They've gotten a significant amount of investment coming in from other Gulf states, mostly around some real estate opportunities. And they've got pledges now from both the World Bank and from the EU to offer support as well. So I think all of the signs for Egypt are pointing up now. 
 That doesn't mean that it's going to be an easy ride. It's not going to be a quick ride, but things are certainly improving. Liquidity is improving. It's just a big positive step in the right direction, and that's going to help as we go forward. And we have had indications from the Egyptian government that we will get a large payment in the second quarter of this year. 
 So we're will be -- and will actually be in Egypt visiting with them around that same time. So that's where we are on the receivables. It hasn't changed a whole lot in the first quarter, but certainly all of the signs of things going on in Egypt are pointing up and improving. 
 In terms of gross volume, we haven't declined for 2 quarters in a row. We've actually -- and if you look back to 2023, gross oil volume was pretty flat for a while and then rose. We're declining now from fourth quarter to first quarter. 
 A lot of that is around completion timing. We actually completed 27 new wells in the third quarter last year, 26 in the fourth quarter and then we completed 17 in the first quarter of this year. So that's not necessarily a surprise that volume -- oil volume might be declining a bit in this quarter. We'll see where we go going forward. We are continuing to reduce the drilling rig count. So that is going to have an effect on the number of wells that will be available for completion. But we'll see as we go quarter-to-quarter through the year on gross oil volume. 
 And then as we approach year-end. And as John said in the prior question, we've got to work through this issue of the balancing of workover rigs and workover capacity with our drilling capacity because it's not a very efficient use of capital to be drilling new wells when workover is so much more capital productive than drilling new wells. Nothing wrong with drilling new wells, but workover is cheap and normally returns quite a bit of production volume to -- on the line. 
 So you got to make sure you have the capacity to stay on top of the workover program. And we've got a lot of ideas on how we can work through that. Ultimately, there is longer term, the possibility you could bring more workover rigs into the country, but there are a lot of other things that we can try to work through before we get to that. So we've got a lot to do in 2024 to get things balanced properly and functioning properly between drilling new wells and working over and working our way through that backlog. 
 And then as we roll into '25, we'll give a better view to where Egypt is going. 
Leo Mariani: All right. That was very helpful, very good explanation there. And I guess just maybe turning to Suriname very quickly here. Just wanted to kind of get a better sense of kind of where things stand. I know you're still working towards FID kind of what's your confidence level with your partner on achieving that later this year. And it sounds like there's still no drilling happening in '24, but does Apache anticipate some drilling there in '25. 
John Christmann: Yes, I'd just say we're very confident be it still underway, and we would anticipate an FID by year-end. So it's all moving forward there. And then that's going to dictate timing in terms of drilling we've got till 2026 to start the exploration program. So there's nothing pressing on the '25 side, but we could be back to drilling in '25. 
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. 
Neil Mehta: John, I wanted to spend a little bit of time talking about the Callon cost synergies. And specifically on the operational side, you're talking about high-grading the service providers, stuff around casing, surface economics. So can you just spend some time getting us on the ground and giving us a little bit more granularity around some of those cost synergies on the operational side? 
John Christmann: Yes, I'll jump in, and I'll let Steve add a little bit more color. But in general, we're changing the program. So you're going to see fewer wells per section, fewer landing zones, larger fracs in general. The other thing is when you look at the well count in terms of how they complete their wells, Callon was putting 1/3 of their new wells on ESPs and 30% on gas lift. We've been running outside of Alpine High about 3% ESP and 60% gas lift. 
 So that's the other place in terms of just how we're equipping the wells, how we're flowing the wells and producing the wells and then obviously, the power then that is needed to drive those sub pumps is another big factor. I'll also say that they turnkeyed a lot of their stuff. I mean they turnkeyed a lot of their frac operations and we're going to self source and do a lot of stuff there. 
 So there's a lot of low-hanging fruit on the operations side. So those are some of the big ticket items. And we've already seen a lot of that, which is why you've seen us increase a lot on the operational side. 
Stephen Riney: Yes. Neil, I'd just add, if you went back to the Permian slide deck that we published in February, we specifically pointed out 3 areas where we felt like Callon was significantly kind of off the mark in terms of where we would want to be on LOE per BOE, workover cost per BOE and downtime percent. And they've -- Callon has a history of a much higher well failure rate including for new wells. 
 They have a higher rate of ESP failures than we do. And many of those are around -- we feel around their equipping choices, and we're already making some changes on a proactive basis in that -- even on some of the wells that they've already drilled and completed and equipped. There was a lot of inefficiency around compression and the use of their compression fleet, and we're making across a larger set of operations, we can make more economies of scale around compression optimization and even on the rate negotiations for compression costs. 
 As John pointed out, they have a tendency to use a lot of ESPs for which they purchase power. That's very expensive and a big contributor to their LOE per BOE. They use a lot of contract labor, a lot of our supply chain aspects of using APA rates around services and around product, using volume discounts that we get across the larger operations and just reducing overall usage. 
 They had a very high water handling and disposal costs, which we believe we can do much better at. They had a high rate of rental, rentals of ESPs, rental of compressions where we think we can do better at that as well. On the capital side, we'll use more technology to drill to use -- to decrease average drilling days on wells. We'll get better rig rates. 
 We'll do a better job of rig moves because we're not moving rigs across the basin between the Delaware and the Midland Basin. We will use spudder rigs generally for a lot of the wells that we drill. They did not have a practice of doing that normally. Frac rates will get better at proppant costs, again, more supply chain type of stuff. And then on facilities, we -- they typically have built facilities spec. We typically try to modularize that. We will typically go to multiphase flowing through a single line. They like to use test separators and meter 3 products in 3 different lines. 
 So we think there's just -- and there's just a whole bunch more of stuff that we're going to be looking at and doing to reduce LOE per BOE and downtime and the workover costs. 
Neil Mehta: That's a very thorough and helpful explanation. And good look as you bring the asset into the fold. 
Operator: We now have a question from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. 
Paul Cheng: Steve, I have to apologize. When you talk about dry holes, I sort of missed that. Can you repeat it? I think you're saying that you have a way of in share name on Block 52 that's I think 40-some-odd million. So what's the remaining with the driver expense at 123 -- the second question is that yes, go ahead, please. 
John Christmann: I'll jump in. The -- there's 1 dry hole in Suriname, which was related to Bonboni up in the north. It was one that we held and weighted because we didn't know how the North would factor in on the future exploration side. And so that's why we took that one now. And then we went ahead in Alaska and rolled off the 2 wells that we failed to reach TD on simply because the decision was made that it would be easier to go back and redrill those prospects with brand-new wells. And so that's what the dry hole expenses were for. 
Paul Cheng: I see. And John, on Alaska in King Street discovery, can you share that what's the thickness of the [indiscernible] that you have 2 [indiscernible] do you have any data about permeability or that any information that you can share? 
John Christmann: Well, it's very preliminary, Paul. But we're excited about both. I mean these are not shallow wells in the Brookie and play, 2 high-quality oils -- we were also very pleased with the early data, but we need to get the rock data back into the lab and analyze that and go through all that before we really share anything. 
 I think one of the big read-throughs on King Street though, it was the smallest and the most risky of the 3 prospects, even though it's the one we got down all the way, but there is a very positive read through in the Upper Zone at King Street for the big target in Voodoo, so it's very exciting. And if anything, it has us feeling even better about the program and the acreage going forward. 
 I mean we've moved 70 to 90 miles east of working hydrocarbon system. Truly wildcat area, and now we've proven petroleum system. We've proven oil, and there's also very high-quality sand there. So a lot to get pretty excited about going forward in Alaska. 
Paul Cheng: Right. And John, you're saying that you're going to drill the 2 new well for Sockeye and Voodoo. Is that going to be done? Or that is going to be drilled in the next drilling season? Or that you guys have not decided and may get pushed out further? 
John Christmann: I'll just say, it's highly likely that we redrill both prospects -- but it's -- we've got to work through the partners, and we don't have to make decisions yet on the 2025 drilling program. So we're -- it's something we'll be working through with the partners over the next several weeks. 
 But at this point, it's something that could be done in '25. It doesn't have to be done in '25, but we'll be working through the partners with that. 
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to John Christmann for closing remarks. 
John Christmann: Yes. Thank you. In closing, our Permian is performing extremely well, and we have just bolstered it with the addition of Callon and is now approximately 75% of the company. We will be integrating Callon over the next couple of quarters. And by the fourth quarter, you should start to get a good picture of what we can do with the Callon assets. 
 We have pulled from some frac capital into the second half of the year, which should really give us strong momentum as we head into 2025. On the cost synergy side, we have increased our expectation by 50%, and we'll capture most of these by year-end and we believe there is even more to do beyond that. 
 And lastly, we'd like to make more progress on debt reduction by the end of the year while also meeting our 60% shareholder return commitment. Thank you very much for joining us today. 
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-22 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the APA Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Gary Clark, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Gary Clark: Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2023 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO, John Christmann. Steve Riney, President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development; Tracey Henderson, Executive Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations.  Our prepared remarks will be about 15 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels.  I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss on today's call. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. Also, please note that the forward guidance we provided with our fourth quarter results reflects our outlook for APA Corporation on a stand-alone basis only and does not incorporate pro forma effects of the pending Callon Petroleum acquisition.  And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call today, I will review our key accomplishments in 2023, comment on fourth quarter performance and provide an overview of our 2024 plans and objectives. APA has a long-standing strategic framework for managing our business that emphasizes investing capital with a focus on long-term full-cycle returns, pursuing moderate sustainable production growth, strengthening the balance sheet to underpin significant cash returns to shareholders, responsibly managing costs, including rightsizing the organization commensurate with lower activity levels, growing inventory, both organically through existing play expansion and new area exploration, and more recently, building scale and/or adding inventory inorganically through acquisitions such as Callon. We have patiently employed this strategy through periods of considerable price volatility, and our approach going forward will remain unchanged.  Looking at APA's results, there were a number of highlights in 2023. The more notable achievements include on the whole, delivering on all of our production and financial metrics very close to original guidance. Egypt gross oil production lagged expectations for most of the year, but this was offset by continued strong performance from the Permian. Free cash flow generation of nearly $1 billion, 66% of which was returned to shareholders. We repurchased $329 million of common stock and paid $308 million in dividends. Adjusted oil production increased 4% from the fourth quarter 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by Midland and Delaware production, which was up in excess of 20% over the same time period.  We successfully appraised the Sapakara and Krabdagu discoveries on Block 58 in Suriname, identifying an estimated 700 million barrels of recoverable oil resource. On the ESG front, we now have implemented more than 70% of the projects necessary to achieve our 2022 goal of eliminating 1 million tons of annual CO2 equivalent emissions by the end of this year. Additionally, we replaced or converted more than 2,000 pneumatic devices in the United States during 2023, which aligns with our priority to reduce methane emissions across our operations.  And lastly, I want to recognize our operation teams for delivering the lowest recordable incident rate since we began tracking and reporting this metric. We highly value this commitment to safety and excellence, and thank you for your continued diligence on this front.  Moving to fourth quarter results. Upstream capital investment of $520 million was slightly above guidance, as we spent $27 million on the initial phase of our winter exploration program in Alaska. The U.S. delivered another strong quarter, with oil production in line with guidance and up 12% compared to the fourth quarter last year. Throughout 2023, our 5-rig drilling program was highly efficient, meeting or exceeding all key performance metrics.  Similarly, well connections and well performance were in line with or better than expectations. Our Midland and Delaware Basin teams are driving outstanding results, and we expect that will continue this year. In the North Sea, production for the quarter was below guidance due to unplanned compression downtime at both Beryl Alpha and Forties during the month of December. And in Egypt, adjusted production exceeded guidance, primarily due to higher natural gas production and the positive impact of lower oil prices on volumes within the PSC construct.  Gross oil production, however, was lower than expected for a few reasons. For several quarters now, we have been working through some activity delays and scheduling constraints associated with limited available workover rig capacity in Egypt. In addition to routine well maintenance and uphole recompletions, we also utilize workover rigs for completing many of our new drill wells. With the increased size and improving efficiency of our drilling program, the demand for workover rigs to complete new wells has exceeded expectations. This meant the workover rigs were doing fewer recompletions than planned and our workover backlog increased throughout the year. Thus, while production from the new wells was a bit better than expectations, Egypt gross oil volumes fell behind as we could not adequately support the recompletion and workover programs.  Compounding this, we also experienced a number of early life failures on new electrical submersible pumps known as ESPs. During 2023, we had 9 new wells impacted by early ESP failures, 2 of which occurred in the fourth quarter on high-volume wells. We have traced this problem to 1 manufacturing facility, and the situation is in the process of being remediated. In 2024, we will gear down the Egypt drilling program a bit, which will free up workover rig capacity to reduce the workover and recompletion backlog. I will say more about the effects of this on 2024 activity in a few minutes.  Turning now to our 2024 outlook. Given the potential for a flat to lower price environment this year, we have established an activity plan and budget based on $70 WTI and $75 Brent. We continue to diligently manage overhead and operating costs, and we are reducing our total capital investment to less than $2 billion. This includes approximately $100 million of investment for exploration activities and $50 million for FEED work and potential long-lead items in Suriname. This year's budget will redirect capital to the Permian Basin, resulting in reduced Egypt drilling program, which I mentioned earlier.  The outcome of this investment profile should be relatively flat year-over-year adjusted oil and natural gas production, but lower NGL volumes given our current plans to reject ethane. As in 2023, we expect robust Permian oil production growth to roughly offset production declines in the North Sea, while Egypt adjusted production remains relatively flat. In the U.S., total volumes will be up about 2% on a BOE basis despite our current plan to reject ethane for the entirety of 2024. We also project a strong finish to the year, with U.S. oil production up more than 10% in the fourth quarter of '24 compared to the fourth quarter of '23. This growth will be driven by the Midland and Delaware Basins, where we expect to achieve our goal of returning oil production to pre-COVID levels by year-end.  In Egypt, we anticipate that our moderated pace of drilling will result in a gross oil production decline. However, adjusted production should remain relatively flat year-over-year, primarily due to lower oil price expectations and the moderating effects of the PSC. And in the North Sea, with our significant reduction in capital investment prompted by the energy profits levy, we anticipate a roughly 20% year-over-year production decrease. This includes the effect of a lengthy planned maintenance turnaround that will impact both second and third quarter volumes.  Before closing, I'd like to take a minute to highlight our performance in the Permian and provide some thoughts on our pending acquisition of Callon Petroleum. For several years now, APA's Permian operations have been hitting on all cylinders and exceeding oil production guidance. We have delivered continuous improvement in well productivity and capital efficiency, and we expect this to continue in 2024. Since 2019, we have invested considerable time and technical resources in optimizing our drilling economics in the Permian Basin, and the results have been excellent. Our Midland Basin well productivity has moved up into the top quartile producers as measured by third-party analysts, and we continue to improve Delaware Basin productivity measures each year.  The Callon acquisition we announced in early January will bring scale to our Delaware position and balance to our overall Permian asset base, making it fairly evenly weighted between the Midland and the Delaware upon closing. While Callon has experienced operational and productivity challenges in the past, more recently, they have begun to make good progress towards demonstrating the upside potential of their acreage. By leveraging APA's technical capabilities and work processes across the Callon acreage, we expect to further build on their progress, most notably in the areas of capital productivity from well spacing, target zone selection, frac design and drilling, completion and infrastructure efficiencies.  When we first announced the acquisition, we assigned only $55 million to operational synergies and improvements. However, we are confident that there is substantial upside to this number. While the transaction is accretive on cost synergies alone, the big win-win for shareholders of both companies will be the integration of the assets into a larger Permian platform and the technical optimization, capital allocation, process knowledge and discipline that APA brings to the table. We look forward to updating our 2024 U.S. guidance upon completion of the transaction.  In closing, we are managing the business with a clear and consistent strategy, adhering to our discipline and delivering on our commitments and financial objectives. In the last 3 years, we have reduced outstanding bond debt by $3.2 billion and repurchased $2.6 billion or 20% of our shares outstanding. Our Permian Basin and Egypt operations are delivering a high level of free cash flow, along with moderate oil growth in aggregate. We have progressed a large-scale exploration and appraisal program in Suriname to FEED study, and we believe this will drive high-margin oil production beginning in the 2028 time frame. And more recently, we have further expanded our exploration portfolio with large-scale opportunities in Alaska and offshore Uruguay.  While the industry may experience some near-term commodity price weakness, we maintain a constructive medium- and long-term outlook. Accordingly, we will continue to invest a measured amount of capital in the differential longer-term exploration opportunities. And lastly, we remain fully committed to returning at least 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders through our base dividend and share buybacks. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney.
Stephen Riney: Thank you, John, and good morning. For the fourth quarter, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, APA reported consolidated net income of $1.8 billion or $5.78 per diluted common share. As usual, these results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which was a $1.6 billion increase in net income related to the partial release of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset. This was offset by a $167 million after-tax increase in the estimated net remaining decommissioning obligation for the old Fieldwood assets in the Gulf of Mexico. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $352 million or $1.15 per share.  Free cash flow was $292 million in the quarter. Through dividends and share repurchases, we returned 68% of this amount to shareholders during the quarter. And as John noted, for the full year, we returned 66% of free cash flow. Please refer to APA's published definition of free cash flow for any reconciliation needs.  G&A expense for the quarter was $75 million. This was significantly below guidance, mostly due to the decrease in the APA share price and the mark-to-market impact on previously accrued share-based compensation. In the fourth quarter, our Cheniere gas sales contract contributed free cash flow and pretax net income of $74 million, which was below guidance, as LNG margins over Houston Ship Channel narrowed through the quarter.  Turning to 2024. John already discussed our capital and production guidance, so I will just touch on a few other items of note. Based on recent strip prices, we currently anticipate our Cheniere contract will contribute cash flow of about $100 million for the full year and third-party marketing income related to our gas transport obligations will be roughly breakeven. In the Gulf of Mexico, our remaining Fieldwood-related decommissioning exposure is now $815 million. This is net of remaining security and anticipated future cash flows from the producing properties. These decommissioning costs are estimated to be incurred over the next 10 to 15 years, and in 2024, will amount to around $60 million.  Finally, we are preparing for the closing of the Callon acquisition, with a joint integration team working through plans for day 1 and beyond. John already indicated our confidence in meeting or exceeding our $55 million goal for annual operational synergies. We are equally focused on the transition of G&A activities and the refinancing of the Callon debt. At this time, we still expect the sum of the G&A and financing synergies will meet or exceed our goal of $95 million on an annualized basis. A majority of the G&A synergies are expected to be realized on a run rate basis shortly after closing, with a small portion requiring a transition period, which may take up to a few months. The financing synergies will be realized within a few days of closing, with the refinancing of the Callon debt planned and ready to be put into effect.  We noted at the time of the acquisition announcement that the assumption of Callon's debt would increase our leverage metrics slightly. This has had no adverse impact on our discussions with the rating agencies, nor on their published outlooks. We continue to target a BBB rating or the equivalent thereof with all 3 agencies. For this reason, we remain focused on further debt reduction, which will be achieved through the application of cash flow and possible asset divestments.  And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Doug Leggate: Thank you. John, good morning, and Steve, it's always interesting to hear how the operator tackles it, but I'll take that. Egypt, it sounds like you've identified the issue. Can you give us some idea as to what the point forward resolution is then? When can you anticipate that? I mean, ESPs should be -- sounds like a really simple issue to solve. Now you've identified it. I mean, why would you not get back on a growth trajectory once this is resolved? I guess that's what I'm really trying to figure out, what do you see as the go-forward outlook? Take your time line, 3-year, 5-year, whatever, and when do you anticipate this turning around?
John Christmann: Yes, Doug, I'll first start off and say the ESPs was kind of the second factor and kind of piled on. The underlying factor is just the ratio of the workover rigs to the drilling rigs. And these aren't just normal pulling units. These are good sized workover rigs. And if you go back historically, we've usually run close to 2x to 3x, the workover rigs to the drilling rig count. As we've said, we use these workover rigs to complete new wells, to perform the recompletions and do the workovers. And our ratio really has been just slightly over 1.  And so we're ratcheting back, kind of gearing down the rig program. We're still going to run 13 to 15 rigs. So it's not a major reduction, but we want to get the workover count work down. We've got a very large asset base there, and it's important that we're getting to the key workovers and the recompletions that underpin those decline rates. And so there's no reason to keep drilling more wells quicker and piling more ducks into the system right now, it's just not the most efficient use of capital given the workover rigs.  On the sub pumps, you're exactly right. These were the high rate sub pumps that we needed as we brought on 9 big wells last year. There was a problem with the manufacturing. We've identified that, and we are in the process of fixing that. So that will get straightened out and is being addressed right now. But it's really more a function of trying to balance the workover rigs and the number of wells we're drilling with the drilling rigs on a go-forward basis to kind of get into equilibrium to make sure we're investing the capital wisely and efficiently and getting the most out of it.  So once we work that down, I mean, I'd say today, we estimate we've got close to 13,000 barrels a day that's offline that needs to be worked over. We usually run around 5,000 barrels a day. So there's about 8,000 barrels a day there we need to work down and it's going to take a number of workovers and projects to do that. So we're on it. I think once we get into a good equilibrium point, then we can revisit the rig count at a later date.
Doug Leggate: And on the medium-term production outlook, can you touch on that?
John Christmann: We're just going to guide to flat adjusted production, net production for Egypt for now.
Doug Leggate: Okay. We'll watch that. Gosh, I'm kind of torn as to where to go. I wanted to ask about Callon, but I don't imagine we're going to get much more from that today. So I would like to ask Tracey maybe about the exploration program. We only have to look back at some of your peers on what exploration did for their portfolios. And it seems to us, exploration never gets outlook until you've got something to show for it. So characterized for me, please, how you see the risk profile? Alaska specifically, I believe, is near field exploration, you're going to have 3 wells this quarter, I guess. So what -- I'm assuming you're already halfway through those wells. What are you seeing currently? How would you characterize the risk profile of your [indiscernible]?
John Christmann: Yes. I mean I'll stop in, just a few things on Alaska, Doug, and then I'll hand it over to Tracey. But one, it's a large, underexplored area. As we put in the supplement today, it's 275,000 acres on state lands. It is highly prospective for what's become a proven play. And Tracey can get into some details into that in a minute. We are planning to drill 3 wells this winter. We are very close to spudding the first well. So we're not halfway through any of them at this point, but it's going to get fun here pretty fast. So Tracey, I'll let you talk a little bit more about the program.
Tracey Henderson: Sure. I'll carry on from what John has mentioned about the exploration program first. And then just give a couple of comments, I think, on your initial question around a little more insight onto the program. I think as John said, in Alaska, it's a position that sits between Prudhoe Bay and ANWR in the Brookian plays. So we've entered into an area where we have analogs there that have worked, but are looking and exploring in an area where that particular play has not really been explored for. So we're testing in a region where play has worked in an under-explored region. As you said, we're drilling 3 wells this season. All of those will spud in Q1, and we'll come back with an update on that once we've completed this season's drilling program.  I think in terms of just the portfolio, if you look -- we talk a lot about play diversification and portfolio diversification. And I think what you're seeing us build is optionality both in risk with some areas that are more proven, with some areas that are going to be more exploration based like the Uruguay licenses that we entered last year. So what we're really seeking to do is build a portfolio that will give us play diversity both in types of plays, onshore, offshore and with risk through time, both in near-term optionality like we're seeing in Alaska and longer-term optionality like we're seeing in Uruguay. So more to come on Alaska in the near term later this year.
John Christmann: And Doug, 1 more thing on your first question. We're limited in Egypt with the number of workover rigs that are in-country. So you're not in the U.S. where you can just go pick up workover rigs and pull in units. We're dealing with a constrained resource there. And so we have to kind of gear around that at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Neal, your line is open. Please check your mute button.
Neal Dingmann: Hello. Can you hear me?
John Christmann: Yes.
Neal Dingmann: My first question is also on Egypt. Specifically, I want to understand -- definitely discuss and understand the need for the activity change in the region. John, can you just speak a little bit about what you're seeing on the recent well performance and productivity there versus last year? It seems to still be quite good. I would love to hear more color on that.
John Christmann: Yes, Neal, the '23 program really performed in line as expected. So the new wells were good. We even had some -- what I'll call some really high success in the Barnes area, where we had the potential to bring on some high-impact wells. We just ran into some challenges on the ESP. So program has been good and the new well program is in line. So it's all about getting the balance together and just ratcheting back a little bit until we can go faster at a later date.
Neal Dingmann: No, that makes sense. And then the second question just on the Permian. While I appreciate still not having yet the pro forma Callon guidance, are you able to say anything about just sort of broader decisions if you just simply add the D&C of your activity with theirs? Or I'm just wondering, maybe it's too early for that. And if it is too early for that, could you maybe instead just talk about the cadence, how we should think about the existing activity there this year?
John Christmann: Yes. I mean as we sit today, we're limited on the company, the company interaction we have. We -- both companies have integration teams that are set up on the transition side, and so we're working through that. And as you clear certain hurdles, we can start to interact more. But at this point, we're working towards having a very smooth closing and transition. And we really believe that should take place sometime in the second quarter.  When you look at our operations, we'll be running 6 rigs Permian this year. They're running 5, and we'll start out with those 11 rigs, and we're very comfortable running those 11 rigs and really look forward to being able to integrate the Callon assets into our workflow and our schedules and so forth, but that's going to take a little bit of time. So as you know, we've been delivering outstanding results. And we're anxious to jump on their Delaware assets in addition to what we're doing in the Delaware and our Midland Basin.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.
Robert Brackett: All right. I think that's for Bob Brackett?
John Christmann: Yes, Bob, you're good to go.
Robert Brackett: Excellent. Following up with Alaska, kind of a 2-part question around setting expectations of what you're trying to do with this program and when you might be finished. In terms of what you're trying to do, it looks like this is a stratigraphic test more than anything and maybe a VSP to get some seismic control. And it looks like you guys have to kind of be done and off the ice end of April, and therefore, you might have some results by then? Is that fair?
John Christmann: Yes, Bob, as you know, you're limited on the winter window, and we are getting ready to get started with the first well. And we'll actually have 3 rigs drilling kind of simultaneously pretty quickly. So we do anticipate being able to get 3 wells down prior to breakup.
Robert Brackett: And these are stratigraphic tests?
John Christmann: Yes. You've got -- I mean, Tracey can say a few words, but you've got good seismic control. And they're fully supported. So we feel good about them, but it is exploration.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles Meade: John, to you, Steve, Tracey and the rest of the APA team there. John, my first question, I want to pick up, right, where you kind of left off, I think on 1 of the first questions about Egypt saying that more workover rigs was not -- is not an option that you're limited there. Is that a -- is there a time frame for that? In other words, I understand you might not be able to get 1 in 3 months. But maybe in 12 months, you could get a couple more workover rigs. So is that a possibility? And then the other aspect of that is -- you look at try to debottleneck your system, is there a possibility that you could bring in some wireline or coiled tubing to offload some of the work items on your workover rigs?
John Christmann: Charles, I'd just say, first of all, short term, there's not any real options. And obviously, the -- there are several avenues and things we've explored and been exploring. But getting equipment into a country like Egypt takes time. And so at this point, we don't have any real near-term options, and it's something we'd be happy to talk about later if we find a solution. But right now, we're just -- we're limited to the 20 workover rigs that we currently have.
Charles Meade: Got it. Got it. I appreciate it. And then back to Alaska. I saw -- I read that 1 of your partners there referred to the prospects that you're going to test as Pika lookalikes. And Pika being the Santos development that went FID in '22. So I guess I'm -- I'm curious, would you agree with that characterization? And for those of us who are just coming up to speed and learning about this, can you offer some details on what -- if you agree, is a Pika -- that the prospects are Pika lookalikes? What that means?
Tracey Henderson: Sure. Tracey. Thanks, Charles. I'll weigh in on that one. Yes, I would agree with that. We're really looking at more play types like Pika and Willow versus Prudhoe Bay. And we're exploring that, and that is part of the Brookian play that we're exploring it for, but we're going to be exploring for it in a younger sequence, but it's absolutely sort of the same geologic model and setup that we expect to see basically just a bit further east than it's been explored for on the other side of Prudhoe Bay. So we would agree with that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng: John and Tracey, happy to apologize. First, if we can go back to Alaska. Let's assume the program is successful. What's the next step? And what kind of infrastructure you need to put on in order for that to be able to grow? And what is the time line on that?
John Christmann: Yes. First of all, Paul, thanks for the question. I'll just say we're in the exploration phase at this point. So we've done a lot of scoping. It's onshore, it's state land, so things can move a little quicker than federal there. You're close to big pipeline capacity. But let's work through the exploration phase, see what we find and then go from there at a later date. So -- but we're excited about it.
Paul Cheng: But can you maybe share that -- what type of infrastructure we've been needing if it is successful?
John Christmann: Well, a lot of that will hinge on, these are 3 separate tests of similar play concepts. And a lot of that would just hinge on what we found. So at this point, we're purely in an exploration phase. And we'll just have to come back and give you some characterization if we have the success there that we hope we have.
Paul Cheng: I see. On Egypt, I just curious that, John, is the workover availability issue just happen, something happened in the country and that what used to be available no longer available? Or that your own need for the workover rig have just increased substantially last year? And if that's the case then, is that something that's happening in the rest of that, that led to that?
John Christmann: Yes. I would just say, historically, we were running -- if you go back to pre-modernization, we are running 5 drilling rigs and 12 workover rigs. We took the rig count up more than 3x to 15 to 18, and we were only able to take the workover rig count up to 20. So we could only double that when we tripled the drilling set. And -- so initially, it wasn't a major problem because we were trying to get the efficiencies lined out on the drilling side. But as we got the efficiencies lined out on the drilling side, the workover rigs they were required to complete the drilling wells. And ultimately, we've got to make sure we're managing the base. So it's just -- it's a new phenomenon. And it's something that ultimately longer term, we're going to need more workover equipment in country. And there's just not a good short-term fix to that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta: Yes. First question I had was just on Suriname. Maybe you could step back, John, big picture, talk about where we stand here. And we know we've got the FEED study that you're working through and you're targeting an FID in 2024. But what are you focused on as it relates to Suriname and any updates as it relates to that project?
John Christmann: Neil, first of all, thanks for the question. Secondly, that's exactly where we sit today. We're working with Total. They're in FEED study. We've kind of laid a time line out there that we anticipate an FID before year-end, '24, which is this year, which is great news. And then as of right now, we would say first oil in '28. But I can tell you, our partner and us are working hard to try to accelerate those time lines. But that's where we are at this point. So we remain excited. We do see additional exploration potential in Block 58. But right now, we've kind of got most of the attention on the move in the first development project forward.
Neil Mehta: And then the follow-up, we haven't really talked in Q&A about the U.S. production profile over the course of the year. Just maybe talk about your Permian plans. It sounds like it's going to be a little bit back half weighted with strong growth exit to exit. So just any thoughts on Permian oil and navigating the weakness, obviously, in local gas prices there, too.
John Christmann: Neil, we've had a number a good run of years of really outperformance in the Permian. And when you're running 5 to 6 rigs, which is what we've done, then it becomes very pad dominated in terms of your timing and your sequences. And yes, we don't have a number of -- very many wells coming on early this year. Things are kind of second and third quarter back weighted with the way the schedule works. And so you'll see strong Permian growth on the oil side. We're anticipating up 10%, Q4 '24 over '23. And that's going to more than offset the decline in the North Sea. So continues to be underpin our backbone, and we're going to continue to lean on Permian.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Securities.
Arun Jayaram: I wanted to first see if you could talk about the payment situation in Egypt. We did see an improvement in the working capital situation in the quarter. But Steve, maybe you could provide an update on where you stand in terms of ARO and how the collection trends have been with the Egyptian government?
Stephen Riney: Yes, Arun, as you know, we've talked about this a number of times since every quarter. We have a very active and constructive working relationship with Egypt, but it does require that ongoing conversation and work of the issue. Fourth quarter, we ended fourth quarter with our lowest quarter end past due receivables for the year from EGPC. And so we continue to make progress. They've come down through the year. They kind of peaked in early second quarter. Today, we're about 25% to 30% below where we were at that peak level. So they're still elevated, past due receivables still elevated from EGPC, but they're lower and trending in the right direction, have been pretty much through the whole year.
Arun Jayaram: Great to hear. And Steve, my follow-up is I wanted to go -- if you could go to Slide 30 in the deck. And just talk about -- I want to understand a little bit more about the abandonment cost impact to cash flow. Your costs incurred for the year were $979 million. Your total upstream capital is $520 million. Most of the delta is to ARO. So in 4Q, did you all have an outflow for that, call it, $347 million for ARO? And is $60 million, what you mentioned in 2024, maybe a good run rate for the next several years?
Stephen Riney: So you're talking about the ARO for Fieldwood?
Arun Jayaram: Yes, sir. Slightly...
Stephen Riney: So that does not go through the capital program there. It's -- there's a booked liability on the decommissioning obligation there. And so it doesn't go through the capital program, that doesn't show up as capital expenditure.
Arun Jayaram: Right. So -- but I'm looking at the costs incurred, which were $979 million in the quarter. Were there any outflows associated -- or maybe you could quantify the magnitude of outflows with ARO in 2023?
Stephen Riney: Yes. Can we -- maybe we could just take that offline instead of reconciling through the group here. I'll work with Gary to get back in touch with you. We can work through. I just want to make sure we understand the question.
Arun Jayaram: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, Steve.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with ROTH MKM.
Leo Mariani: Just wanted to kind of get back to the exploration discussion here. Just wanted to see if you guys could provide a little bit more color on kind of the risk profile in Alaska. I mean do you see these wells as kind of 1 in 2 shots, kind of 1 in 5? Just anything you could do to quantify some of the risk profile would be helpful. And then on just Block 53 in Suriname, it looks like you relinquished most of that block. Just any update on the thinking there.
John Christmann: Yes, Leo, I'll jump to Suriname first. I think we've been pretty clear that we see more exploration upside remaining in Block 58 versus Block 53. And so it was an easy answer to go ahead and let 53 go. When you look at the risk profile on Alaska, these are 3D and amplitude supported, but you're going to be -- this is a step out in an area where there's risk associated with it. So I'm not going to give you a number on a ratio, but it is exploration. We're taking -- we're going to drill 3 wells. And they are risky, but they're high reward. So -- and I don't know, Tracey, anything you want to add to that?
Tracey Henderson: Yes, I'll just comment, I think, on a little on both pieces, which is the Block 53 exit. I think we saw -- we mentioned on the previous call that we really saw the prospectivity in Block 58 as being more prospective than what we saw in Block 53. So what you're seeing with that exit really is strategic portfolio management and continuous high-grading of the portfolio where we saw more prospectivity both in Block 58 and in other opportunities that we had in front of us.  And I would just echo what John said on Alaska. There's -- we have a range because these are exploration prospects that have risk associated with them. But clearly, what interested us in the block is that we do see materiality with these prospects that we -- warranted expiration.
Leo Mariani: Okay. That's helpful. And I just wanted to follow up on some of the comments that you guys made here. I just wanted to make sure I understood this. Did I hear a comment that APA might be adjusting its headcount a little bit downward in response to some of the lower activity levels? I know clearly that once you guys integrate Callon, I'm sure you'll have to take a fresh look at the whole organization. But did I hear that right, but perhaps you think that maybe you might cut some of the APA headcount here at some point?
John Christmann: I mean, I'll just say, we're always looking to rightsize organization with activity levels. I think the comment in the prepared remarks was that we find ourselves in a much lower price environment. We're always wanting to reduce activity and associated staff if we need to do so. But we have gone through an exercise in the North Sea as we're kind of rightsizing for late life. And so we have gone through some steps there. But we're, quite frankly, very excited about integrating the Callon assets and pulling those into the organization. And we do see some synergies there, but activity levels are still going to be strong and relatively close to where we were last year.
Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to John Christmann, CEO, for closing remarks.
John Christmann: Yes. Thank you. We have chosen to reduce our capital this year and maintain roughly flat production given the potential for a lower commodity price environment while still funding our strategic initiatives. We have intentionally directed more capital towards the Permian, which is performing at an extremely high level. And we look forward to integrating the Callon assets into our Permian operations as well. And lastly, we will keep you up to date on our progress in Suriname and our other exploration plays. Thank you, operator.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-02 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the APA Corporation's Third Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to first your speaker today, Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Gary Clark: Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's third quarter 2023 financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also, on the call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development; Tracey Henderson, Executive Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations. Our prepared remarks will be about 10 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you had the opportunity to review our financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. The full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call, we will review third quarter highlights, discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter and provide a high level overview of our capital plan and anticipated production in 2024. For the third quarter in a row, adjusted oil production exceeded the high end of our guidance range; good execution and strong well performance in the Permian are the primary drivers of this trend. We also achieved the high end of our guidance in the North Sea during the quarter, which benefited from the production ramp of the Storr North well. In Egypt, gross oil volumes grew by approximately 4,000 barrels per day, which was a bit below expectations as previously disclosed. On a total company basis, third quarter reported oil volumes were up more than 15% from the same quarter in the prior year, and we are very pleased with this progress. Activity in the U.S. and Egypt remained steady, while we suspended drilling activity around mid-year in the North Sea. Our investment program in the North Sea is now directed towards safety, base production management, and asset maintenance and integrity. In Suriname, we achieved a very important milestone during the third quarter with the completion of a successful appraisal drilling program at Krabdagu on Block 58 and the subsequent announcement by our partner TotalEnergies of plans to proceed with feed work for a 200,000 barrel per day FPSO in the Eastern portion of the block. The planned oil hub is underpinned by an estimated 700 million barrels of recoverable oil resource at Sapakara and Krabdagu and is targeted FID by the end of 2024. Turning now to our outlook. In yesterday's financial and operational supplement, we issued fourth quarter guidance, which anticipates slightly lower production on a BOE basis compared to the third quarter. The primary contributor is in the North Sea, where the temporary shut in at Brae Bravo will result in volume deferrals of about 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the U.S., completion timing will lead to a relatively flat quarter consisting of unchanged oil production and a small decline in natural gas. And in Egypt, a combination of higher oil and lower natural gas volumes should deliver BOE growth, but not enough to fully offset the downtime in the North Sea. Let me provide a bit more color on production operations in Egypt. In February, we established a gross oil target of 154,000 barrels per day for the fourth quarter. We now estimate that number will be closer to 150,000 barrels per day, which is up about 5,000 barrels per day from the third quarter. After successfully working through the challenges associated with ramping our rig count from 11 to 18, our drilling program is now performing as planned. However, we have experienced a growing backlog of work over projects over the last two quarters and a corresponding uptick in barrels offline. To address this, we have begun to increase our work over activity, which Dave can discuss further in Q&A. During the fourth quarter, we are opportunistically accelerating the completion of eight Permian wells from January into December and adding a 6th rig in the Delaware Basin. This will result in an increase in our estimated fourth quarter upstream capital to around $500 million and bring full-year upstream capital to just under $2 billion. I should note that these investments will not have a material impact on fourth quarter production. As we typically do at this time of year, I would like to provide a high level overview of our 2024 outlook, which we will follow-up with formal guidance in February. Recall that we entered 2023 with a planned upstream capital budget of $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion. As of today, we expect a similar range in 2024, albeit with some changes in regional allocation. We are targeting low-single-digit oil production growth next year, with expected increases in the Permian and Egypt more than offsetting declines in the North Sea. APA remains committed to returning at least 60% of our free cash flow this calendar year to shareholders. During the first three quarters of the year, we generated $673 million of free cash flow, 65% of which we returned to shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks. This leaves more to do in the fourth quarter, and we will fulfill our minimum 60% commitment for the full-year. One of APA's core principles is to produce oil and gas safely and to reduce the environmental impact of our operations. I am pleased to announce that we recently achieved an important milestone in reducing methane emissions with the conversion of over 2,000 pneumatic devices in the Permian to lower emitting technologies. Our programs to identify and eliminate emissions throughout our global asset base are ongoing, and we continuously seek to expand and improve them. In closing, we are committed to our strategy of maintaining a diversified portfolio and maintaining operational flexibility to respond quickly to commodity price volatility and other externalities. We are demonstrating this today through the reallocation of capital from the North Sea into the Permian and Egypt. We also remain committed to investment in a portfolio of exploration projects which have the potential to drive differentiated future growth and competitive full cycle economics. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney.
Steve Riney: Thank you, John, and good morning. For the third quarter, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, APA reported consolidated net income of $459 million, or $1.49 per diluted common share. As usual, these results include items that are outside of our core earnings. The most significant of which was a $93 million release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax asset. This was offset by a loss on the quarterly mark-to-market of our Kinetik stock ownership and unrealized derivative losses on our Waha basis swaps. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the third quarter was $410 million or $1.33 per share. Free cash flow, which for external purposes excludes changes in working capital, was $307 million in the quarter. Through dividends and share repurchases, we returned 32% of this amount to shareholders during the quarter. As John indicated, year-to-date, we have returned 65% of free cash flow to shareholders. Please refer to APA's published definition of free cash flow for any reconciliation needs. In our 3Q earnings prerelease, we anticipated G&A expense would be significantly higher than our underlying run rate of cost, which is around $100 million. For the quarter, reported G&A was $139 million, mostly because of APA stock price appreciation and the mark-to-market impact on previously accrued share-based compensation. As we have explained in the past, the mark-to-market of share price movements also impacts LOE, CapEx and exploration expense. Thus, these items were also higher during the third quarter for the same reason. North Sea taxes also came in above guidance in the quarter by $46 million. This was the result of an incremental cargo lifting late in the quarter, which was not anticipated at the time we provided 3Q guidance in August. In accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, we recognize cargo liftings in the quarter they occur, which increases revenue and current tax expense, but has no impact on reported production volumes. To be clear though, this is just a movement of revenue and income tax expense from the fourth quarter into the third quarter and has no impact on our anticipated full-year North Sea production revenue or income tax expense. As previously noted, our Cheniere gas sales contract commenced on August 1 and contributed two months of free cash flow in the third quarter. You will find this impact on our P&L in the two line items, which capture the revenue and costs associated with oil and gas purchased for resale. In the third quarter, the Cheniere contract contributed free cash flow and pre-tax income of $32 million. We currently anticipate it will contribute approximately $90 million in the fourth quarter and $375 million for the full-year 2024. In closing, as anticipated, the second half of 2023 is poised for improving production and free cash flow versus the first half of the year. With the improving performance, we are tracking very close to our original full-year guidance across most of our key financial and operational metrics for the year. We will continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And while our balance sheet is much stronger than a few years ago, we continue to recognize the need for further progress on debt reduction. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Doug Leggate: Thank you. I think Gary just lost a bet on name pronunciation, but thanks for getting me on. Guys, the North Sea, I wonder if you can offer a little bit of color on what you see as a declining curve there with no capital. And where I'm going with this is obviously you've got, I believe the gas compressor. These are all the assets, I guess you're having to take it off the platform and so on, that's going to come back. And obviously production will decline because you're not spending any money. But my question is, how does the decline look versus the free cash flow in the North Sea. It strikes me that the free cash flow in a declining curve could actually be higher.
John Christmann: Yes, Doug, it's a good question. We're in the process right now working through the 2024 plan. Clearly, we've got some downtime that we've announced in the North Sea in the fourth quarter, as we do have a compressor that we had to haul onshore. We'll get that back on sometime early next year and then you'll be back at your base decline both for Forties and barrel. Forties is underwater flood, so it's got much lower decline than barrel. But we do not have the rig. We'll continue to focus on maintenance integrity projects and we'll come back early next year with a detailed look when we give out the 2024 plan.
Doug Leggate: But is it fair to say that versus 2023, when you were spending capital, that free cash flow could be higher, John?
John Christmann: I think it's early on the --
Dave Pursell: Yes, Doug. Yes, I think it's -- as John was about to say, I think it's a bit early to state that for 2024. It's certainly a possibility, but let's get to February. We'll have a detailed plan and then we'll -- and we'll know kind of what type of price environment we're looking at as well, and we'll have a better analysis on that at that point in time.
Doug Leggate: All right. Thank you. John, my follow-up is in Suriname; I managed to get a red eye to Total's Analyst Day this year and asked Patrick a very specific question about timing. And I wanted to get your perspective on this. What -- my understanding is that the 2028 schedule for first oil assumes a 42-month new build FPSO, but since that announcement, I understand that SBM has been selected with an early hull. In other words, a year earlier on that timeline with some 70% expected to be contracted at the time of FID. I know you're not the operator, but I wonder if you could confirm or offer any color around those points.
John Christmann: Yes. I would just say for now, I mean kind of the official timeline is FID by the end of 2024 and first oil by 2028. But obviously there's incentive and motivation to try to accelerate that, and I would expect that they will do everything they can to do so.
Doug Leggate: Fair enough. Thanks, guys.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: Standby for our next caller. And that is John Freeman with Raymond James. John, your line is open. Please go ahead.
John Freeman: Yes. The first question I had on the sixth rig that's getting added in the Permian well is the plan for that rig to operate exclusively in the Delaware or potentially toggle between Delaware and Alpine High?
John Christmann: John, it's a spot rig, we're picking up. It'll kind of go pad to pad. It will start in the Delaware on some oil pads, but then there's flexibility and we'll come back in February with a little more detail obviously on the 2024 plan and how that would sit.
John Freeman: Okay. And then, just my follow-up question, I appreciate the preliminary sort of outlook on 2024. If I take kind of what you said about the budget being in a kind of flattish versus 2023, and I think about like the sixth rig that's largely kind of funded with the North Sea CapEx reduction. And then Egypt, you've said previously is kind of status quo next year. And so it seems like just of your three main operating areas that's kind of flattish and the wild cards kind of expiration. Was your commentary about kind of a flattish budget? Is that all in? Does that include the expiration side? If you can kind of just walk us through kind of how you see the expiration in a year where there's probably a step down in activity and concern on ahead of FID?
John Christmann: Yes, John, it's a great question. Yes. It includes about $150 million of expiration. I think you laid it out pretty accurately. You'll see a full-year without drilling in the North Sea. You'll see an increase in the Permian, relatively stable drilling lines in Egypt, and you will see about $100.5 million in terms of expiration is what we're sketching out at this point. So relatively stable program with continued exploration investment like we've done over the last several years.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Bob Brackett: Yes. Good morning. You talked about in terms of the Permian; if we think about 12 net completions in 3Q is kind of driving flat production QonQ in 4Q, 20 net completions in 2Q allowed you to grow the following quarter. And it sounds like you've already connected 12 wells in October with 18 coming in the rest of the queue. Does that imply a pretty strong cadence into sort of 1Q of next year in terms of the Permian?
Dave Pursell: Yes. It's a good question, how timing of completions drives the quarterly production cadence, this is Dave Purcell, by the way. The remaining completions this quarter will be weighted more towards December, and then we'll provide you in February with what the cadence of completions looks like in 2024. And as you can imagine, there'll still be some lumpiness and we'll provide that in February once we get the plan finalized.
Bob Brackett: Okay. Quick follow-up, if there is an FID in 2024 around Suriname, does that change that CapEx budget of 2.0 or 2.1 or it's kind of a rounding error?
John Christmann: No, at this point, we've factored that in, Bob.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Neal, your line is open. Go ahead.
Neal Dingmann: Thanks for the time. So my first question is just on Egypt. I'm just wondering if the 2024 plans will continue to have sort of a similar level of exploration development activity. And if so, should we assume somewhere around I mean in your estimate around that sort of same drill and success next year?
John Christmann: Yes. Neal, program it will be pretty stable. We're running 18 rigs in Egypt and it is a steady diet of both development and exploration and I anticipate that to be very similar next year. And we do expect to be able to continue to show good growth in Egypt.
Neal Dingmann: Very good. And then, my second John asked a little bit on this but just on the Permian gas plans. I'm just curious if your decisions if and when to go back and boost that activity. Is that based more on how those gassy well economics compete against your oily Southern Midland or Delaware economics or is it just simply if those gas returns would provide a certain rate of return?
John Christmann: I mean it's really more a function of stability in the Waha pricing. And the wells we've drilled this year have been strong and very competitive. I mean I think at $3 at Waha, they're very, very competitive with Permian oil. So -- but it's really more a function of when we believe we'll have stability there at Waha that you can produce some end of the infrastructure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Scott, your line is open. Go right ahead.
Scott Gruber: Thanks. Can you just coming back to Egypt, you mentioned growth next year. Is that going to be on a year-over-year basis or do you think the exit to exit will be up as well?
John Christmann: Yes. We'll give you the details when we rollout the plan in February, but we'll show growth most likely year-over-year end exit. But let us give you those details in February.
Scott Gruber: Okay. And then, just think about the next few years. You have a project that would be moving forward in Suriname and obviously you have the carry from Total. You still have $1 billion or so of commitment. Can you just speak to whether that impacts your cap allocation across the rest of the portfolio on a multi-year basis?
John Christmann: Yes. I mean we look at the multi-year plan and that's the beauty of the carry is it's going to keep that in a very, very manageable place from where we've been. So I mean that we basically structured that deal, banking on success and you'll see that start to follow through if we move through the next phases. So got to FID a project first, but that's where the carry will kick in.
Operator: Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo Securities. Roger, your line is open. Go ahead.
Roger Read: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Just to follow-up Egypt had a little release of capital or working capital this quarter. Just how do you think that looks going forward? And also in Egypt, given that they've had some gas issues related to imports in the med, any interest or pressure from Egypt to have you increase gas production there? Is that something that could occur in 2024? That's not really a reasonable assumption given locations of fields and takeaway capacity, et cetera.
John Christmann: There's no doubt Egypt needs more gas production. We're flowing everything we can into the grid, which is where our gas goes. Our program has been focused on oil as we receive 265 per MMBtu there. But short-term there's not anything we could do to increase gas production. But there are some longer-term projects, but we would need to work on a higher gas price there.
Roger Read: And on the working capital thoughts?
Steve Riney: Yes, on the working capital, this is Steve. So we did have an increase in working capital in the quarter in Egypt, as you will see in the supplement. So the receivables did go up during the quarter, but receivables from EGPC actually went down during the quarter. And if we go back to first quarter of this year, when I think the concern about the payments from EGPC kind of surfaced at that point in time with the first quarter results in May. Since that time, from first quarter -- end of first quarter to the end of the third quarter, EGPC receivables have gone down and so have the past due receivables from EGPC. So I think we're in good shape there. We've made making progress; we've made some good progress. And as John always says, we're in constant contact with the highest level folks in Egypt about managing that receivable balance. So we're making some good progress there. More to go, but we're making good progress. I think the issue with a reason why receivables went up in the third quarter is because we were exporting more cargoes than selling them to third parties. And those third-party receivables have gone up during the quarter because we were -- third-party receivables were low at the end of the second quarter and higher at the end of the third quarter. So those are receivables that are just paid under normal terms from our normal credit worthy and on time paying purchasers of the oil coming out of Egypt in export cargos.
Roger Read: And that's in that situation, just normal seasonal or month-to-month kind of changes, nothing to read into that percent of that.
Steve Riney: Right, right. And you'll see there is a -- at the corporate level, not just in Egypt at the corporate level, there's a meaningful increase in working capital during the quarter. And that also is just seasonal type things. We had some payables in particular a large one around taxes, large cash payment in taxes in the UK that comes in the third quarter. And so a lot of seasonality to working capital movements for the company as a whole.
Operator: And our next caller is Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Welcome, Charles. Your line is open.
Michael Furrow: Hi, good morning. This is Michael Furrow actually filling in for Charles Meade.
John Christmann: Hello, Michael.
Michael Furrow: Hi, okay, just one question for me regarding Suriname. I know FID is not expected until late 2024 and this might be a bit premature, but when do you think that further exploration could occur within Block 58. And I recognize that Total is the operator here. So maybe a better way to frame it would be when would APA like to further explore Block 58 and maybe if you could even speak on Block 53.
John Christmann: No, it's a great question. The focus this year was appraisal of Krabdagu, so we could start a project in terms of getting it moving into the next phase. And we're in a position to do that now. We do see several high quality, low risk prospects in Block 58. A lot of the program at Krabdagu that obviously appraised that fairway also de-risked in our mind a lot of prospects. There's no urgency in terms of getting to them in 2024, but we will be working through those with our partner. And when I look at the two blocks, we see more prospectivity in 58 over 53. We're working with our various partners there on the next steps at Baja, but I think we would see more prospectivity in 58 over 53 at this point.
Operator: Please standby for our next question. And our next question is from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Scott, your line is open.
Scott Hanold: Yes. Thanks. My question is going to be on just general exploration. I mean, obviously you got Suriname going on, but more recently, you've kind of farmed in a position in Alaska. And on top of that, obviously you've got different things in Uruguay and Dominican Republic. Can you tell us in general, just first maybe starting with Alaska and then how you think about these other prospects moving forward for APA?
John Christmann: Alaska fits our exploration strategy and that is trying to build a high quality portfolio. We've got a proven operator, its state lands, very, very prospective acreage and it's something we look forward to sharing more in February. And it's all about a portfolio on the exploration side and having choices to high grade and drill the best things that are going to create the most shareholder value.
Scott Hanold: So when I think of APA, and look, I mean it seems to be in contrast with some of, I guess, your U.S. or even just E&P peers where there's a lot of, I guess, M&A going on there for domestic shale. But it looks like APA is taking a little bit different angle or is there still a desire to potentially maybe even bulk up in the Permian or other focus areas where you do have more, I guess, proven production at this point?
John Christmann: Yes. I mean I think we like to look at both avenues, both the organic and the inorganic. And we stayed committed to an exploration program and you're seeing that pay off in Suriname and longer-term, but I also think you saw us last year bolster some acreage in the Delaware. So it's a diet of both that you're constantly looking at and you've got to continue to focus on adding to the assets as well as what can create value for your shareholders.
Scott Hanold: So when you look at the Permian Basin, do you all feel at a five, six rig pace? You've got -- what you'd say ample inventory of kind of Tier 1 stuff?
John Christmann: Yes. I mean, I think with where we sit today, five to six rigs, David say, into the decade pretty easily. And that's focused on higher quality, longer laterals and we're always -- we've got a nice footprint that we're always moving inventory from one category of up into the high graded as we continue to test and find ways to make it all work, so.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum with TD Cowen. David, your line is open.
David Deckelbaum: Thanks for taking my questions, guys. John, I wanted to just ask, are you able to tell us the $150 million you have earmarked for exploration next year? This I guess to be more pointed about it, how much of that is included for ex-Suriname exploration?
John Christmann: At this point, we'll come back with more color next year on the program. It's a placeholder and we're working through. There's some other things we'll be doing. You've got exploration in Egypt that we've always funded and some other things, but we'll come back with more color in February.
David Deckelbaum: Appreciate that. Maybe if I could just follow-up on Egypt. You talked about the growth trajectory in the next year and I certainly know that U.S. oil is anticipated growing next year. Can you give a little bit more color just on what's happening with the increased work over activity? What's driving that? And are there any alterations being made that this won't be a drag into next year? Or is this being factored in with greater frequency now that you have this increased rig count?
John Christmann: Yes. I mean it's a situation where we've always had, I'll call it a wells or a volume offline that requires work over. We have a lot of sub pumps in Egypt and we've had some increase in the failures in a few areas and that number's ticked up. And Dave can get into some more color, but we've just got more barrels offline that we need to get to on the work over side. And we're addressing that, so it's something we're jumping all over.
Dave Pursell: Yes. And so just to follow-on what John said, we're working on a root cause analysis just to understand, are we seeing a structural change in well failures, we've seen a reduction in ESP run times, but we're doing a broader look at that. And to put some numbers on John's comment, on base level of work over inventory, that typically represents about 5,000 barrels a day of production that's offline at any given time. We've seen that increase to over 10,000 barrels a day, really from the end of the second quarter through today. So we've added a work over rig. We're doing some other things to start working that backlog down over time.
Operator: With Roth MKM, Leo, your line is open. Go ahead.
Leo Mariani: Hey guys just wanted to follow-up briefly on Egypt here. I think you guys maybe added a rig recently. I think you were at 17 earlier in the year, if I sort of got it right. So just curious, is that just because of lower North Sea activity or just kind of reallocating dollars here? And then I guess just in general, obviously there's been significant instability there kind of in that Sinai Peninsula area bordering Israel there with the conflict that's happening right now. I mean, do you guys have any concerns over potential spillover into Egypt and have you been kind of in contact with the Egyptian government regarding them?
John Christmann: Yes. It's something that it's interesting. We're coming up on our 30th anniversary of being in Egypt. So we've got a great history there. We've been there a long time and we've been through watched Egypt go through a lot of trying times. This year has been difficult for them and it's really been driven more by inflation and currency devaluation and some of those factors. We're closely monitoring the situation. I think the good thing from our perspective is our operations are all West of Cairo into the Western desert. And if you go back in history, even over the Arab Spring, we have not had any shut-ins or major interruption in our operations. So I think the good news there is the government continues to prioritize oil and gas operations. They know they need the in country production and we've been watching things very, very closely, so.
Leo Mariani: Okay. That's helpful. And then, in terms of the $150 million in exploration next year, I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but as you kind of looking at that at a high level in your mind, does that include some dollars in Suriname at this point or is that just sort of kind of still an open ended proposition?
John Christmann: It's in general right now; it's a placeholder for the things we want to do. But there's seismic that'll be being shot in Suriname in the where would be the development area, some other things. So it'll capture our exploration spend for next year and we'll come back with more details in February.
Operator: And our next question comes from Geoff Jay with Daniel Energy Partners. Go ahead, Geoff.
Geoff Jay: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. Really my question is around U.S. oil production, which looks like it's taken a pretty impressive step change. I mean, obviously you completed some more wells but obviously several quarters where it was just kind of locked into the 70s. Now we've taken this 8,000 barrel a day step-up in Q3. And I'm wondering a) what changed and b) if there's something that's happened that has kind of prompted this decision to add another rig in the Delaware. Thanks.
John Christmann: There I mean it's really just a continuous program. I mean, we're seeing the benefit of the deliberate approach we've taken. We've been focused on long laterals and really locking the rig lines down and giving the teams time to execute and you're seeing that we've continued to drill long laterals and we're continuing to have good results. It's really just a function of the timing of the completions. In terms of adding the sixth rig, it's really more allocation of capital from the North Sea into the Permian. And -- but we look forward to continuing to deliver strong results. And if you look fourth quarter is a little flattish compared to third quarter. A lot of that's because third quarter is running ahead versus fourth quarter running behind. So we're very, very pleased with the execution level in the U.S.
Operator: I am showing no further questions at this time. So this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to John Christmann, President and CEO, for closing remarks.
John Christmann: Yes. Thank you for participating on our call this morning. I want to leave you with the following thoughts. We've completed a successful appraisal program in Suriname at Sapakara and Krabdagu and will advance a project through the feed process during 2024. In Egypt, gross oil production continues to increase on the success of our drilling program. And lastly, we continue to deliver outstanding results in the Permian, where we've added a sixth rig which will add to the momentum as we enter 2024. We look forward to telling you more about the things in February and thank you for the call.
Operator: And this does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-03 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the APA Corporation Second Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is your sir.
Gary Clark: Good morning and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation’s Second Quarter 2023 financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development; Tracey Henderson, Executive Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations. Our prepared remarks will be less than 15 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday’s press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures today. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today’s call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. I’d like to remind everyone that today’s discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, we will review second quarter highlights and discuss our outlook for the rest of the year. APA delivered strong results and made notable progress on a number of fronts during the quarter, most specifically with regard to drilling and completion efficiencies in the US and Egypt. A reduction in year-over-year per unit LOE and G&A costs, working capital improvements in Egypt and the appraisal of Krabdagu in Suriname. We also delivered on our production goals with total adjusted production of 325,000 BOE per day coming in at the high-end of our guidance range. This was driven by good Permian Basin in Egypt oil performance, partially offset by price-related dry gas curtailments in the Permian and unscheduled compressor downtime in the North Sea. Total adjusted oil production of 154,000 barrels per day exceeded our guidance by 4,000 barrels per day, driven mostly by the US. Capital investment during the period was in line with guidance as our average operated drilling rig count remained steady at 17% in Egypt, five in the Permian Basin and one semisubmersible in the North Sea. As previously planned, we released the Ocean Patriot in the North Sea at the end of June. US oil production increased by 6% compared to the first quarter and we are projecting a similar percentage increase in the third quarter. Our steady drilling program in the Permian is delivering substantial efficiencies and oil production increases, which we expect will continue, though the timing and size of pad completions can result in a lumpy production profile. APA's Permian rig activity is directed towards oil development in the Southern Midland Basin, where we currently have two rigs operating and oil-weighted development in the Delaware Basin, where we currently have three rigs operating. As we noted on our last call, we are deferring additional drilling and completion activity at Alpine High until natural gas and NGL prices improve. That said, the most recent wells placed online at Alpine High are performing in line with expectations, and we look forward to returning to work there in the future. Turning now to Egypt. Gross oil production of 141,000 barrels per day was in line with our guidance, drilling efficiencies, new well connections, completions and exploration success were all consistent with our expectations for the quarter. As a result, we are projecting gross oil production will be up 5% in the third quarter to 148,000 barrels per day and we are making good progress toward our fourth quarter guide of 154,000 barrels per day. In the North Sea, second quarter production of 42,000 BOEs per day was well below our guidance due to the previously mentioned compressor downtime. We expect volumes to increase in the third quarter to a range of 46,000 to 48,000 BOE per day, driven by higher operating efficiency and the positive impact of our store North well which went on production in late June. In Suriname, Block 58, we are currently focused on appraising last year's Krabdagu discovery. As previously noted, we have completed testing at Krabdagu 2 and results were consistent with our predrill expectations. At Krabdagu 3, we are in the pressure buildup phase, and data collected thus far is very encouraging. The DD3 semisubmersible rig is still on location and will be released upon completion of operations. We believe that no additional appraisal or exploratory drilling is necessary in the Sapakara and Krabdagu area at this time. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect drilling programs to remain constant in both the US and Egypt. As a steady operational cadence in these areas enables more efficient operations. That said, we have reduced our full year upstream capital investment outlook to reflect previously noted North Sea platform drilling reductions, no additional drilling in Suriname this year and some minor service cost declines. We are also reducing our full year LOE outlook from $1.5 billion to $1.4 billion, which reflects our ongoing success in actively managing these costs down, as well as some price decreases associated with shorter-cycle items such as diesel and chemicals. APA remains committed to returning at least 60% of our free cash flow this calendar year to shareholders. During the first half of the year, we generated $366 million of free cash flow, 94% of which we return to shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks. Since the commencement of our share repurchase program in October of 2021, we have repurchased nearly 20% of total shares outstanding at an average price of just under $34 per share. In closing, we believe the investment case for APA and the E&P industry is strong and that the longer term outlook for hydrocarbon prices is very constructive. APA has a diversified portfolio and the operational flexibility to quickly respond to commodity price volatility and other externalities. We are committed to our shareholder returns framework into allocating capital for the long-term benefit of investors. APA seeks to produce oil and gas safely and to reduce the environmental impact of our operations. Last month, we issued our 2023 sustainability report, which highlights recent achievements on these fronts, as well as our current ESG goals and initiatives. I encourage all of you to review this report, which you can find on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney.
Steve Riney: Thanks, John. For the second quarter, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA reported consolidated net income of $381 million or $1.23 per diluted common share. As usual, these results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which are mark-to-market appreciation in the value of our Kinetik stock ownership and unrealized gain on Waha basis swaps. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the second quarter was $264 million or $0.85 per diluted common share. Free cash flow, which for external purposes excludes changes in working capital, was $94 million in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases, we returned 131% of this amount to shareholders during the quarter. As John noted, both operational and cost performance were very good during the quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, total adjusted oil production was up 14%. Adjusted oil mix increased from 44% to 47%, and we held lease operating expenditures nearly flat. G&A expense was $72 million, significantly below our underlying actual run rate cost. This is a result of APA's lower stock price at the quarter end and the mark-to-market impact on previously accrued share-based compensation. Underlying quarterly G&A costs remained stable around $100 million. Switching to forward-looking guidance. Oil production is expected to increase significantly in the third quarter in all three of our operating regions. Our full year guidance implies that oil production will increase again in the fourth quarter in both the US and Egypt. Declines at the mature Qasr gas field in Egypt and at Alpine High, where we have deferred drilling and completion activity will result in total company natural gas production continuing to decline through the rest of this year. Next, I would like to provide some color related to our changing guidance for profit or loss on our gas transport obligations. As most of you know, we hold just over 670 million cubic feet per day of Permian Basin takeaway capacity, we sell our produced gas in basin and we manage the transport obligation by purchasing third-party gas in basin for resale on the Gulf Coast. We realized a net trading margin based on the price differentials less the total transport cost. Since the transport cost is mostly fixed, this activity will generate a profit when price differentials are wide and a loss when they are narrow. In the second quarter, this activity generated a net profit of $13 million as we have all seen, the differential between Waha and Gulf Coast pricing is compressed dramatically since late May. Based on the forward strip, we anticipate these trading activities will result in a small loss in both the third and fourth quarters, and we have adjusted our guidance accordingly. The flip side of this is that we are now getting higher realizations on our gas produced and sold in the Permian Basin. We commenced deliveries under our Cheniere gas supply agreement on August 1. At current strip prices, this contract will generate approximately $120 million of free cash flow for the last 5 months of 2023 and an estimated $385 million for the full year of 2024. As you know, these cash flows are likely to be volatile from quarter-to-quarter. As a reminder, these projections are net of all costs, including the cost to acquire and transport the gas to Cheniere. Our complete guidance for both the third quarter and updated full year 2023 and can be found in our financial and operational supplement. Finally, a brief comment on Egypt receivables. We have a long-standing well-functioning relationship with Egypt based on nearly 30 years of working in their country. Like many parts of the world today, they are experiencing some challenging financial times and we will partner with them through that process just like we have in the past. Since the first quarter earnings call, we have had very constructive conversations with Egypt. As a result of steps already taken, the receivables balance came down in the second quarter, and we are confident further steps will keep us on the right track. In closing, our original full year production guidance is unchanged and we have reduced our 2023 budget capital and operating expense in aggregate by about $250 million. Our balance sheet and debt maturity profile are in good shape. This was most recently recognized by Moody's, who returned us to investment grade in June. Since the beginning of 2021, we have significantly improved our capital structure by reducing our outstanding bond debt by $3.2 billion, while also returning $2.9 billion to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Q – Doug Leggate: Good morning guys. I'll take that. Thanks for taking my question.
John Christmann: Good morning, Doug.
Q – Doug Leggate: Yes, it's more exotic than it probably should be, but—good morning, John. So couple of things from me. So I want to ask about Egypt, not about the working capital progress, which is terrific. I think you've addressed that, Steve, with your commentary. But I want to ask about the confidence in the medium-term oil growth trajectory in Egypt. That seems to be the only knock on the quarter is that folks or maybe a lot questioning whether you can actually deliver that. So, how is that progressing? What is the outlook today? And I've got a follow-up, please.
John Christmann: Yes, Doug, the nice thing being early August, we have the luxury of seeing a lot of the wells we've got coming on in the near future. And if you look and you won't see it. But our July volumes have actually averaged 145,000 barrels a day on the oil side were up already in July. Over the second quarter, and we've got good line of sight on what's coming, and it's going to be a good back half of the year. And I'll let Dave Pursell jump in with a little bit more detail.
Dave Pursell: Yes, Doug, as John alluded -- or John said, the gross oil at 145,000 in July gives us confidence. We have a couple other data points. We've had good success on exploration in both the [Indiscernible] Basin. So we have good line of sight on the well stock remaining through the rest of the year that will come online. If you look at expected wells online in the back half of the year, it's significantly higher than the front. So, just some numbers first half of the year, we brought 48 wells online. In the back half of the year, we expect to put over 70 wells online. So more wells, high-quality, good confidence in what those wells look like. So again, our confidence in the back half guidance is very good, very high.
Q – Doug Leggate: And what about beyond 2023, Dave?
Dave Pursell: We continue to look at the 2024 plan, and we're too early to give guidance, but we have confidence in the ability to keep the growth engine moving.
Q – Doug Leggate: Great stuff. Thank you for that. John, I apologize, I'm going to have to be predictable. But so Total hoping Analyst Day at the end of September, I think they've a pretty good steer that they're going to have something to say there on Suriname? So, I know you don't want to front-run that, but I do want to ask you about resource scale to the extent you can and what you know today? And I'll frame it like this. When [Indiscernible] sanction in Guyana with similar DORs, the capacity of the development, 600 million barrels, 120,000 barrels a day. From everything we know, especially with Baja and the connectivity there. Tell me why resource of that scale is wildly off the mark?
John Christmann: I mean at this point, a couple of things, Doug. Number one, we still have the rig on location, so it's early. Number two, we came into this year with the primary objective being appraising the Krabdagu Fairway. And you had the original discovery well -- if I flip over, it's a totally different set of partners in Block 53, but we -- when we announced the Baja discovery, we said it was a down dip low above that fairway. So yes, it does stretch from there all the way now back to Krabdagu 3. Krabdagu 3 was 14 kilometers from the discovery well. And as we've said, the results are very, very encouraging. We do -- we can confirm its oil, but it's early for me to comment or say anything at this point. We've got a lot of technical work to do. It's a very large fairway and there will be resource in there that you're not going to see from the flow test. So there's just a lot of technical work that we need to do, and we'll come back in due course with information in the relatively near future.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question and that will come from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. Your line is open.
John Freeman: Hi, guys.
Steve Riney: Good morning, John.
John Freeman: Yeah. The first topic I wanted to address was on the shareholder returns. You returned the 131% of free cash flow this quarter. Last quarter, you did 81%. So I'd just be curious kind of your thought process and kind of how you'll determine when it's the appropriate time to kind of really lean into to shareholder returns, like you did, obviously, that was more than double the minimum 60% target that you'll have. So just sort of how you all think about when it's an appropriate time to kind of lean into these things.
Steve Riney: Yeah, John, this is Steve. If I just -- if I step back and take a look at the year, we always plan that the second half free cash flow would be greater than the first half. And that's going to come from production growth. It's going to come from the Cheniere contract. It's going to come from a lower amount of capital spending that we'll have in the second half. And now as we look at the actual prices for the first half and anticipated prices for the second half price will also be a bit of factor there. So to address one potential concern that maybe we've done most of our share buybacks in the first half, I'd say the second half -- there's still plenty of buybacks to do, plenty of capacity to do that. We've always said the 60% is a minimum. And I think every time period that we would look at, we've exceeded that minimum. We did in that fourth quarter of '21, we did it for the full year of '22 and certainly doing it first half of '23 and I'd just say we did front end, we chose to, obviously, to front-end load the buyback program in 2023. I'd just say that we're very happy with the share prices that we got, especially in the second quarter and we'll see what the second half of the year brings for us.
John Freeman: Okay. And then my follow-up, just kind of following on to Doug's questions on Egypt. Just sort of what you all identified in terms of the you got the mature natural gas field that's declining so that oil mix as we've seen now for the last three quarters just keeps inching up. It looks like just ballpark that for 2024, like something in that like 65% kind of oil mix would be possible. Just sort of any commentary about how you all see that oil mix sort of continue to evolve as it continues to ramp up.
John Christmann: John, that's a great point. I mean as cost continues to decline, you're going you will see our oil mix and need to rise. And if you go back is a legacy large field 3 Ts. It's been on decline and it is declining. And so as costs continue to decline and our programs are in the more oily driven areas, you'll see that mix rise. And so it's early. I don't want to get into '24, but it wouldn't surprise me, and I would probably anticipate that the oil mix will be higher in '24 than it did in '23.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Neal Dingmann: Morning, guys. John, can I ask maybe one more in Egypt. Just specifically, given an ample, I'm just wondering, are you seeing ample equipment and personnel there to continue to run the 17 rigs and if so, given the strong results and your strong balance sheet, any thoughts to boost activity next year?
A – John Christmann: Neal, it took us a little bit on last year with training programs to kind of get the program where we wanted it. We're there today. So we feel good about that. We've put a lot of training in place I think right now, 17, 18 rigs is a pretty good number. I think it's about all that's in country and from a staffing perspective. So I think we're in a pretty good place. And you're seeing us finally get the results and the efficiencies where we were hoping we'd get to. So we feel like we're in a good place. And right now, that's what I see for the foreseeable future.
Neal Dingmann: Very good. And then my second for you guys is just on the Southern Midland. Could you speak to now, have you changed or are you walking up the average size, lateral length seems like some of your peers are continuing to get larger wells, larger pads to try to get more efficiencies. So I'm just on the same mindset.
A – John Christmann: Yes. We came into this year really with our programs focused on the longer laterals, a lot of two and three milers. So Dave, I think you've got little more color or some statistics there.
A – Dave Pursell: Yes. So just on the Permian in general, we continue to walk lateral length higher. If you look at last year, we averaged just over 10,000 feet. This year, we're going to average closer to 10,500 feet for lateral. Again, there's variance. There are some 3 milers and there's some 1.5. But on average, the program is getting longer. And in 2024, we anticipate the links will continue to inch a little bit longer as well. And I think on the frac side, we've tended to lean to a little bit looser spacing and larger individual frac stage size. And have had good success to that. And so I don't know that we'll get any bigger, but we've -- we're pretty comfortable with where we are on our completion designs at this point.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Q – Scott Gruber: Yes. Good morning. I'm going to peer around the corner a little bit too here to 2024 on the US side, it looks like implied in the full year guidance that your US oil reduction can continuing the decline in 4Q, you're maybe getting to the mid-80s. How should we think about 2024 at this juncture in terms of oil growth in the US?
A – John Christmann: It's early in terms of numbers. I mean we typically don't start getting into 2024. I can tell you, we're working the 2024 plan and a lot of detail right now that we start getting into reviewing that and so forth in the fall. I would anticipate pretty level activity sets from where we are today. And so if you look at that with the programs we're delivering and the types of laterals we're drilling, I would expect fairly similar increments of growth may be on a little higher base in terms of with the volume that we're growing this year. But it's always lumpy. We're running five rigs with the timing -- so I don't know how the timing will line up year-over-year, fourth quarter over fourth quarter, some of those numbers. But I would expect a very strong continuous program in the US and in Egypt for 2024.
Q – Scott Gruber: And if deflation in service costs here in the States, if that turns out to be more material? Do you end up recycling that back into more drilling, or would you kind of keep the program the same in light of that deflation and just reap the benefits in terms of greater free cash?
John Christmann: I mean, I would say right now, the plans would be to take the program and let the program dictate because five rigs, we're working 1.5 frac crews, a pretty good cadence there. It's hard to just add incrementally without going up in stair step function. So I would anticipate that the service side, whatever benefits there would come to free cash flow and the program will be pretty stable. We do try to go in every year with a pretty set framework on the capital side. And so a lot of what's going on this fall will dictate what our service costs will look like for the portions that we will try to lock down for next year. So we'll just have to wait and see how things play out. And clearly, you've had a little bit of softening in some areas right now, but I think everybody is waiting to kind of see what prices do in the back half of the year. to really steer next year's capital.
Operator: Thank you. That will come from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is open.
Charles Meade: Good morning, John, to you and your whole team there.
John Christmann: Good morning, Charles.
Charles Meade: John, I have to say I'm as I'm sure you guys all are to see all the -- or to learn about all the appraisal results at Krabdagu, but I recognize we're going to have to wait a little bit. So I want to instead ask about Waha. And specifically, what your plans are or what the considerations are for appraisal there? I recognize that you guys said it's in the same deposition system as a Krabdagu. And perhaps as part of talking about your plan for appraisal, can you also address it, is it also one of these shelf slope kind of targets, or has it is -- are you maybe starting to hit the transition into the basin four fans out there?
John Christmann: I can let Tracey in a second, get in a little bit to the geology, but what I'll just tell you first on Waha, it is a discovery that we discovered the discovery well is in Block 53, where we have a separate set of partners as opposed to Block 58, it's in Total. We are the operator of Block 53. And so I can't say a lot at this point other than we've got a lot of work to do in terms of does Waha potentially flow into an oil hub in Block 58, or does it make up its own project in Block 53. So at this point, I can't sell a lot there other than, obviously, there's a lot of work being done, a lot of different angles looked at. And Tracey, I'll have you chime in a little bit on the geology.
Tracey Henderson: Sure. Good morning, Charles. I think great question on the fairway and your initial assessment there about in a system what we've discussed in the past. So what we're describing is a fair way. And as John mentioned in his remarks, something we've defined now that's roughly 25 kilometers from Waha to Krabdagu 3. So you've got a very robust system that's coming through here in a series of slope channels that you call from our original release at Krabdagu 1, which are stacked systems. So correct in your assessment, we're seeing slope channel systems, as John said, we've got more technical work to do. We still got a well on location and a lot of work to integrate going forward.
Charles Meade: Thank you, Tracey, thank you, John. That’s it for me.
John Christmann: You bet.
Operator: Thank you.  One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open
Roger Read: Thank you. Good morning.
John Christmann: Good morning, Roger
Roger Read: John Just like to ask about Egypt and not from an operational standpoint, but it's been more financial, I don't know if I'd call it risk or just it's Egypt being Egypt. But I was just curious how things are going in terms of your ability to from the operations in the country, return capital out of the country as needed or as desired and anything else we should be watching there?
John Christmann: No. I mean, as Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks that Egypt in a lot of places around the world right now are going through some difficult times. There is stress in the system. If you look at wheat prices and things, but from a standpoint of our business, it's been pretty much normal course in terms of movements and things like that. And you've seen us working constructively with Egypt to make progress, and you're seeing that. So.
Roger Read: Okay. I'll take that as a good answer. And then my other question is just as you look at operations in the Permian, what would be the broader description of sort of productivity and efficiency gains you're seeing sort of leaving any service cost inflation or deflation aside, but just what you're seeing in terms of performance on the drilling side, on the completion stages, things like that.
Dave Pursell: Yes, Roger, this is Dave. So on the drilling side, we continue to improve our drilling performance. Again, there's any number of metrics, which I won't bore you with. But the drilling team is doing a good job of getting our wells down in a very efficient manner where I think you might be going is on the productivity side. Lateral lengths, as I talked about earlier, getting a little bit longer and that helps. But on a lateral length adjusted basis, relaxed spacing and bigger fracs have been a benefit to us in getting those lateral length adjusted productivity numbers to continue to improve. And it's always hard to forecast or we're going to keep getting better, but we're happy with the program so far, 2023 looks pretty good compared to 2022. And the team -- we have a pretty good or very good subsurface team that continues to try to push the envelope productivity per foot, and we're striving to continue to move that into 2024.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Securities. Your line is open. 
Arun Jayaram: John, good morning. I wanted to get your thoughts on how the process you think will move once you fully evaluated the Krabdagu 3 results towards the declaration of commerciality and perhaps an FID decision?
John Christmann: Yes. I mean, Arun, first of all, it's -- like we said, we're rigs still on location, and so we've got a lot of technical work to do. But we'll come back at some point with more data. That is exactly what you just mentioned would be the steps you'd take. And we've got a lot of work to do to be in a position to do that. And obviously, we'll be working with our partner in Total. So.
Arun Jayaram: Got it. Got it. I mean I just wanted to maybe follow up there. Total has a frame agreement with the subsea provider, John, as you know, and they've raised the scope of the SURF package to over $1 billion from previously to $250 million to $500 million. Anything to read into that in terms of potential boat size at this point?
A – JohnChristmann: The only thing I'd say, and I'm going to defer, we'll let Total handle those relationships, and that's what they're -- they'll be operator, right? I'll just leave it at that. But I mean, I would say we came into this year with the goal to appraise Krabdagu because we said it could impact scope scale. And clearly, we've had a positive result at Krabdagu 3. So that was one of the objectives with the appraisal program and the number three well was designed for a very large step up to better understand potentially what type of resource we could have there. So we've got a lot of technical teams do the work, but that was the objective coming into this year was to help better understand scope and scale.
Arun Jayaram: Great. A quick follow-up on the North Sea. John, oil prices, Brent is now moving eclipse 80. What do you think needs to happen for the North Sea to attract capital next year? And -- and maybe just thoughts on the broader portfolio. If we get in the situation where the Northeast is not competitive. Are you just comfortable with, call it, two legs of the stool ex-Suriname at this point?
A – JohnChristmann: I mean obviously, the nice thing is, is having a diverse portfolio where we've got places to put capital. And we basically program in the North Sea with the Ocean Patriot for six months. You see us in a good position in terms of sustaining and growing the company. So as we look at next year, we'll factor in what makes sense. But right now, more importantly from the North Seas perspective, you'd need to see some stability in the regime to make long-term investments. And right now, we have not seen any stability. And so I would not anticipate us jumping in because prices are up and deciding to put a lot of capital in the North Sea at this point than what we need to do for maintenance and integrity and safety.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Leo Mariani with ROTH MKM. Your line is open.
Q – Leo Mariani: Hi, guys. I just wanted to follow-up quickly on Suriname here. So certainly seems as though you guys have found significant oil here, Krabdagu based on the comments you've made. I understand there's more technical work to go. But I'm just curious little bit kind of around the thought process on kind of stopping drilling for the rest of the year. It feels like you've got great momentum there. You found a lot of oil at the end of the day, why get rid of the rig for the last, call it, four or five months of the year, why not sort of building that momentum, drill some of the other exploration targets just given how vast the basin is at this point in time?
A – JohnChristmann: Yes, Leo, I mean, we've got a large block. We've got a lot of time for other prospect areas and so forth. And I think the key was coming in, there's been a focus on let's get to project and an oil development, and that was what the focus was this year. And there are other prospects in the Krabdagu and Sapakara area. But at this point, we don't think it's necessary to drill those right down so.
Q – Leo Mariani: Okay. And then just in terms of the US well performance, you guys talked about this a little bit. It sounds like there have been some changes to the completion design potential here with a little bit kind of wider spacing. But it seems like the oil performance there has been a lot more consistent. You guys basically said that it looks like 2023 well performance is a little better than 2022. Just kind of wanted to get a little sense of what do you think the kind of running room here is on kind of the Tier 1 Permian acreage. If you look out handful of years. Do you guys have kind of an estimate on how long you can kind of keep five rigs running and kind of how much inventory you have maybe in terms of kind of rig years or something?
Dave Pursell: Yes. Leo, we've talked about kind of our visibility is kind of through the end of the decade on this run rate in this program and -- no change to that. So we're pleased with -- we're looking at a 3- to 5-year plan and pretty happy with what we have in there. So stay tuned.
A – John Christmann: Yes. The other thing I would add is if you look at the evolution of the program, a lot of the stuff we're drilling today that's Tier 1. Two years ago, we had it at Tier 2, Tier 3, right? We've got a nice acreage footprint. And so you're always also looking to see the evolution of the resource. So we've got strong confidence in the U.S. inventory at this program rates.
Operator: And thank you, one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Jeffrey Lambujon with TPH. Your line is open.
Q – Jeffrey Lambujon: Good morning, guys. Appreciate taking my questions. I wanted to ask my first one on US activity. Just wondering if the two Midland and two Delaware quits good to assume as part of that base case of steady activity. And if you could talk about how you think about toggling that in the near term, if at all, whether in terms of inventory comparing the two or any of the factors, I'd imagine the flexibility of the Delaware in terms of proximity of the Alpine High plays into some degree if you can also maybe speak to what you want to see there in the macro or from the wells to add back any sort of capital there?
A – Dave Pursell: Yes. Jeffrey, just a good question on the Midland versus Delaware split. If you -- again, as rigs are fungible, we could there's no magic a Delaware rig could move over to the Southern Midland Basin. But if you think about a the next 18 months or so, two in SMB and three in Delaware Basin is to make sense. And then the question on Alpine, it's really about not just gas price, but what gas price does it take for those wells to be competitive versus an oil rig line, either in SMB or Delaware. And those are the decisions we'll be looking at is Matterhorn comes online sometime back half of next year.
Q – Jeffrey Lambujon: Okay. Great. That makes sense. And then maybe just a follow-up on the North Sea. I know it's already a relatively smaller to the budget and getting smaller, just looking to next year with the release of the Ocean Patriot, as you guys highlighted, but can you talk about what sort of operations we should think about there just in terms of steady state going forward and what that means for CapEx? It seems like year-over-year, you could maybe be looking at something like maybe half the spend that was originally budgeted for this year.
A – John Christmann: Yeah. I mean I think if we look at the back half of 2023, we've got around $50 million of capital in the North Sea. And that's probably what you'd assume going into -- for each half of next year. I'd say so $100 million, give or take, is what it would look at like today roughly. I think the biggest thing there is just philosophy change. I mean, we're going to be operating for safety and integrity and managing decline and managing free cash flow. And there's still a lot of life left. I think the important thing is even by pulling the Patriot out, it doesn't really change our timing on when we see abandonment. I think we're still well into the early 2030s. And so we're going to do as good a job with that asset managing it for free cash flow.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Paul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning guys. John, maybe guiding, but I think at one point that's a number talking about your Suriname so far, the discovery, say, around 800 million barrels. Just wanted to clarify if that is the right number, and that's in pace or are we comparable way and whether -- I assume that's not including the Krabdagu-3 lastest appraisal. And just want to see, is that the geologies that to make what kind of reasonable recoverable weighting pace that we should assume any reason that you won't recover more than 50% of the resourcing pace? That's the first question.
John Christmann: Yeah. So Paul, the -- you get to the 800 million as we've disclosed at Sapakara from the original well, the second well, we had more than 600 million barrels of connected resource. So that's where six of it comes from. And then the original 200 was from the discovery well from the flow test we did there at Krabdagu. So the 800 million number is -- would be a connected resource in place, and it's not a recoverable number, but it also does not include Krabdagu-2 or Krabdagu-3 and the integration work that's going on now that will move forward. So -- and Dave, you might reference just it's really high-quality rock, and it'd be early to talk about actual recovery factors, but you can give some insights there.
Dave Pursell: Yeah. Paul, I think if you can just look at historical recovery factors in big deepwater discoveries to put a range on it, the recovery factors are a function of the field development plans that you have. We're going to have gas injection here. And again, there'll be a lot of pressure maintenance. These are high-quality reservoirs. So I think you'd expect high recovery factors. But at this point, it's way premature to try to put a number on that.
Paul Cheng: Do you have a rough estimate, what's the gas cut in that content there?
Dave Pursell: Yeah. You're talking about gas cut, Paul?
Paul Cheng: Yeah, yeah. What's the gas percentage, or what's the oil percentage either way?
Dave Pursell: Yeah. I don't have that at the tip of my fingers, but we've put the GORs in the prior press releases on the Sapakara and the Krabdagu discovery, and we've not disclosed anything yet on Krabdagu-2 or 3.
John Christmann: Yeah. Sapakara was 1,100 GOR, roughly. And the discovery well at Krabdagu had a couple of different ranges from around the high-teens to the high 2000s.
Paul Cheng: Okay, great. And on Permian, you've done a number of three-mile wells. So just want to see that, is there a number you can share what percent of your inventory backlog that you could do three months? And what percent of your work program for the next couple of years is going to be in the three miles? Thank you.
A – Dave Pursell: Yes, Paul, this is Dave. I don't have that number. It's a relatively small percent of the total work plan. We're happy with the results from our three milers. It's really just a question of where does the acreage footprint allow that to allow us to drill the three milers. You can tell just on the numbers I threw out earlier, most of what we're drilling are two milers. But the team, any time we get a chance to drill three miler, we'll do it and that's just acreage footprint. But from a modeling standpoint is probably best to just assume they're all two milers program.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Umang Choudhary with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. 
Q – Umang Choudhary: Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. 
A – Dave Pursell: You bet.
Q – Umang Choudhary: My first question is on the $100 million savings from your operating cost management program. You talked about diesel and chemicals driving some things there. Any additional color you can provide in terms of any other buckets, which is driving those savings?
A – Dave Pursell: Yes. This is Dave. If you look at it, it's really just across the board. It's a lot of things. And really, it's -- the operating team has shown really good cost discipline through the year. We came into the year with some inflationary headwinds and the team kind of took that as a challenge and really is doing a great job in all the areas, Egypt, North Sea and the US and trying to keep those costs in check. And so it's -- diesel and chemicals are easy to see. But everything else, it's just a lot of little things that add up to material numbers. And then I would echo comments from earlier, excited to see more on Suriname down the road. But separately, would just love your thoughts around the M&A landscape and how does that -- how does that compare versus some of your organic opportunities here?
John Christmann: I mean, I think, in general, you've seen a couple of deals take place in the Permian. They've traded at what we viewed as pretty high valuations. You look obviously focused organically. But you've always got to be on the lookout for things that could make sense. And obviously, that's where we are and what we do. We come in every day to try to make this company more valuable and more attractive. So….
Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. John Christmann for any closing remarks.
John Christmann: Yes. Thank you for participating on our call today. I want to close with the following thoughts. Our asset teams are executing at a high level, and we have a high number of quality wells scheduled for the back half of the year which gives us confidence in achieving our full year production guidance. We're progressing in a positive direction in Suriname, and we remain committed to our capital return program. We look forward to keeping you apprised of our progress. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you all for participating. This concludes today's program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the APA Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Gary Clark: Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's First Quarter 2023 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development; Tracey Henderson, Executive Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations.  Our prepared remarks will be approximately 12 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our first quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com.  Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels.  I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, we will review our first quarter highlights, update our operational progress and comment on our outlook for the remainder of the year. For the last several years, we have been navigating a volatile price environment, and this has been amplified recently with the ups and downs of global oil prices, extreme moves in global LNG pricing and the rapid decline in U.S. natural gas prices. Despite this volatility, we are constructive on long-term prices for oil, natural gas and LNG.  Based on this fundamental belief, we plan to invest over the long term for sustainable low single-digit production growth at attractive returns. That said, we cannot ignore price volatility and will, therefore, seek to moderate our investment plans during periods of significant price weakness. We must also be responsive to changing governmental tax and regulatory regimes within our countries of operations. Fortunately, our diversified portfolio provides us optionality, and we maintain the flexibility to adjust our investment plans relatively quickly.  In 2023, we have demonstrated this by reducing natural gas directed activity and even curtailing production in response to extreme Waha price dislocations. We also made the decision to reduce spending in the North Sea as the recently enacted energy profits levy has resulted in less competitive return opportunities than in the U.S. and Egypt. So while you should generally expect us to invest at a steady pace for long-term returns and moderate growth, you will also see periods where we respond to external influences by adjusting or redirecting capital activity.  Turning now to our first quarter results, which are characterized by strong operational performance and good cost control. APA met or exceeded production guidance in each of our 3 regions. Total adjusted production was 4,000 BOEs per day, above the top end of our guidance range. Adjusted oil production also exceeded expectations, led by performance in the Permian and the North Sea. Capital investment during the period was slightly below guidance, and our average operating drilling rig count remained steady in the quarter with 17 in Egypt, 5 in the Permian Basin and 1 semisubmersible in the North Sea.  In the U.S., we connected 17 new wells, and as planned, most of these went online in the back half of the quarter. While timing of well connections can drive production variances, on a quarter-to-quarter basis, we are continuing to see significant benefits from the steady pace of our drilling program.  As expected, first quarter oil production declined sequentially from the fourth quarter. However, we remain on track to deliver a significant uptick in the second and third quarters. Permian activity this year will be concentrated primarily on oil development in the Southern Midland Basin and oil-weighted development in the Delaware Basin. At Alpine High, we are currently testing a new 3-well pad at a constrained rate.  Beyond this, we are ramping down our planed 2023 lean gas drilling activity in the Permian due to the prevailing weakness in Waha natural gas prices. This will result in an upstream capital reduction of approximately $100 million but should have no material impact on our full year U.S. production guidance. We are pleased with the results at Alpine High and will return when Waha prices improve.  In Egypt, gross oil production increased by approximately 1,200 barrels per day compared to the fourth quarter. New well connections, recompletion activity and exploration success were all consistent with our expectations, and we are beginning to see positive contribution from our higher activity pace. For the second quarter, however, we are forecasting that Egypt gross volumes will be roughly unchanged as we have recently experienced some production disruptions, most of which are temporary. Despite this, our full year Egypt production guidance has not changed.  Turning now to the North Sea. Our production exceeded expectations in the first quarter, driven by strong facility operating efficiency. We are projecting second quarter average daily production will be in line to slightly below the first quarter as scheduled platform maintenance and expected return to more normalized facility operating efficiency will be mostly offset by contribution from a new well, which was placed online in late March.  In Suriname, we continue to progress toward an oil hub development project with activity in the first half of 2023 focused on appraising Krabdagu. We have completed the flow test on the first appraisal well and are currently in the pressure buildup phase. Results of this well thus far are in line with expectations. The second Krabdagu appraisal well is currently drilling and we'll provide more information on next steps in the future.  On the ESG front, we delivered another excellent quarter of safety performance and are making good progress toward our longer-term emissions goal of implementing projects to eliminate 1 million tons of CO2 equivalent emissions by year-end 2024. We reduced routine upstream flaring in Egypt by 40% last year, which gave us an excellent start on this goal. In 2023, we plan to further reduce flaring in Egypt and focus on converting diesel combustion for power generation to field gas, which will reduce both cost and net emissions.  In closing, APA has the portfolio and the operational flexibility to respond quickly to near-term commodity price volatility, and we are managing our capital activity accordingly. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders this year via dividends and share repurchases.  Longer term, despite many cross currents, we believe the investment case for APA and the E&P industry is strong, and the outlook for hydrocarbon prices and fundamentals is very constructive.  And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney.
Stephen Riney: Thanks, John. For the first quarter, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA reported consolidated net income of $242 million or $0.78 per diluted common share. As usual, these results include items that are outside of core earnings. The most significant of these items was a $174 million charge related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax liability in the U.K. caused by the most recent increase in the energy profits levy. This was partially offset by the release of a valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets.  Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the first quarter was $372 million or $1.19 per diluted common share. Free cash flow, as we define it, which excludes changes in working capital, was $272 million in the quarter, 81% of which we returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  As John noted, it was a strong quarter for production, and costs were a good bit under plan. G&A expense was $65 million, significantly below both the prior quarter and the same quarter last year. This is a result of APA's lower stock price at quarter end and the mark-to-market impact on previously accrued share-based compensation. Excluding this mark-to-market impact, underlying quarterly G&A costs remained stable at roughly $100 million. LOE also came in a good bit below expectations primarily due to the previously mentioned mark-to-market impact of stock-based compensation programs as well as foreign currency impacts in Egypt.  Switching to forward-looking guidance items. In the U.S., oil production growth is expected to return in the second quarter and should ramp further in the third quarter in conjunction with completion cadence. Our U.S. natural gas production outlook is more muted as we are responding to weak Waha pricing with lean gas drilling reductions.  In addition, we could see further lean gas production curtailments. But to be clear, further curtailments are not contemplated in our U.S. production guidance. All of this is consistent with our bias towards managing for cash flow and long-term returns, not production growth. The $100 million reduced drilling activity John noted will occur mostly in the second half of this year. With that, our full year capital budget has been reduced to $1.9 billion to $2 billion.  Next, I would like to highlight our 2 material gas trading activities that are truly differential for APA, our gas transport obligations and our Cheniere gas supply contract. Our gas transport contracts provide significant cash flow benefits during periods of dislocated Permian gas prices. We hold just over 670 million cubic feet per day of Permian Basin takeaway capacity.  We purchased third-party gas in-basin for resale on the Gulf Coast, realizing a trading margin whenever the price differentials are greater than the transport cost. In the first quarter, this activity generated a net profit of $23 million. Based on current strip prices, we have increased our full year guidance for net profit from such activity to $100 million.  The Cheniere agreement, which will commence on August 1, is another important commercial trading activity. This arrangement provides upside exposure to world LNG margins over Houston Ship Channel on 140 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. For 2023, projected cash flow from this contract has come down a bit from our prior guidance due to the decline in European and Asian LNG prices. Over the past few months, we have provided potential outcomes of annualized free cash flows at different price levels related to this contract. You can find those in the appendix of our financial and operational supplement.  At current strip prices, the Cheniere contract will generate and expected $175 million of free cash flow for the last 5 months of 2023. All of our guidance for both the second quarter and updated full year 2023 and can be found in our financial and operational supplement.  One final item I'd draw your attention to. Looking at the balance sheet, you will notice that our revolver debt increased by a little over $400 million in the first quarter. This was driven by an approximate $500 million increase in working capital primarily due to the paydown of accrued liabilities from December 31, but it also includes increasing accounts receivable in Egypt. Overall, we had a very good quarter to start the year. We're benefiting from relatively stable activity levels within a portfolio that allows us to generate free cash flow and invest in the long-term sustainability of our business. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from John Freeman of Raymond James.
John Freeman: I believe the original plan was after the 3-well pad gap brought on in Alpine High in the first quarter, there was going to be those kind of a break and then there was going to be 5 additional wells that we're going to come out at the end of the year. So is the $100 million reduction in the budget basically just coming from the removal of those 5 Alpine High wells? Or is there more to it?
David Pursell: Yes, John. This is Dave Pursell. We may have had more than 5 wells planned for the middle of the year. But if you're trying to -- there's some moving parts in the Permian budget, but the effect is, yes, the net $100 million is essentially all the Alpine drilling, completion and facilities capital rounds up to $100 million.
John Freeman: Perfect. And then just my follow-up question. I know at some point, there was some discussions about kind of following the release of the Ocean Patriot next month that there was going to be some use of that kind of freed up comp or it might have been to add an additional rig in the Permian. I'm just -- I guess, first of all, is that -- would that be the case? If you were going to increase activity anywhere in the portfolio, is that likely where it would go? And sort of what commodity environment would you likely need to see to potentially add another rig in the Permian at some point in the future?
John Christmann: Well, John, I mean, we did add some more weighted drilling in the Permian with that. That was contemplated. And then you're seeing us drop some of the gas weighted drilling at Alpine. So two effects there.
Operator: Our next Question. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate, Bank of America.
Doug Leggate: Sorry, guys, can you hear me now?
John Christmann: Can be.
Doug Leggate: All right. Sorry about that. I'm sitting in an airport. I have my new boss in on. I apologize, John. My first question is for Steve, actually. Steve, I wonder if you could just elaborate a little bit on your comments about the increase in receivables in Egypt. There's obviously, I think, some concern events over there, the devaluation and so on might have an impact on your ability to get cash out of the country. So I'm just going to hit that right upfront and ask if you can walk us through what you're seeing currently and whether that working capital build is in fact reversible.
Stephen Riney: Yes, Doug, let me just start with the working capital level, and we'll work into the Egypt receivables impact on working capital. So we -- I said in my prepared remarks that we've got about a $500 million increase in working capital in the first quarter, $300 million of that was a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits. So as you might imagine, through the year, we accrue primarily incentive compensation, both short term and long term. And we accrue that through the year. We do that every year, and then we pay it off in the first quarter of the following year. And so that's exactly what happened.  That was a -- we do that every year. It was a little bit larger going from the end '22 accrued liability to what was paid off in 2023 because of the performance, number one, but also because of the share price because it does include the long-term incentive comp, which is share price-based. And because of -- it's a 3 years of programs and because the share price had improved over those years, that raised the cost of that.  So that's $300 million of the $500 million. There was another $100 million decrease in general accounts payable, stuff for operating expense and capital expenditures, things like that. And so that's $400 million out of the $500 million increase in working capital. And all of those things are very common as we go from fourth quarter of 1 year to the first quarter of the next.  Now there were a number of other small, mostly kind of $50 million and smaller items moving in and out of working capital. And that includes a $50 million increase in accounts receivable. And again, I've provided this in my prepared remarks. Just to be completely transparent with folks because I know there's probably some amount of concern over what's going on in Egypt. So in the spirit of transparency, I indicated that accounts receivable in Egypt had increased $180 million.  If you look at our supplement, you'll see a working capital increase for Egypt of $224 million. That includes a number of other things like inventory and stuff like that. So $180 million in Egypt. And I don't know, John, you want to kind of [indiscernible] on Egypt?
John Christmann: On Egypt, just a couple of minutes here, Doug. One, we've been in the country for more than -- almost 30 years and we've partnered with Egypt and EGPC and the highest levels of government the whole time. I'd say over that time period, Egypt has been through a number of challenges and successful reforms. The best thing that we can do to help Egypt and our stakeholders is to deliver oil production growth. And that's what we're doing while reducing our emissions. Egypt, like many other places in the world today, is going through a challenging economic time with inflation. This does have some flow-through to us, but not anything that we haven't had to work through in the past. And in fact, there's been more difficult times in the past. Specifically, they are dealing with the after effects of a currency devaluation in January, and we are currently helping our Egyptian National employees through this as we have also done in the past.  We maintain very deep and long-standing relationships with our Egyptian stakeholders, both at EGPC and within the government at the highest levels, I'll say. And we are confident that they will work through this. And we are also having very constructive conversations on how to address the receivables over time currently. So we feel good and a long track record here.
Stephen Riney: Yes. And Doug, if I could just kind of add to John's comments there a bit. So we are -- it did go up $180 million in the first quarter. And I'd say that the receivables we have from Egypt are higher than historical averages, no doubt. Some of that is price and some of it is the delay in payment. But I'd just comment that, as John talked about the 30 years of history, we've been in this position several times. This level of receivables from Egypt is not unprecedented. It's never a good time to have this happen, obviously. But I would say it's not overly concerning at this point. Egypt's credit rating has been pretty stable since it got upgraded in 2015. We watch the situation extremely closely. And as John said, we're in active conversations about this specific issue, and we're doing that at the very highest levels in the country. So we feel confident about this.
Doug Leggate: Just to be clear, guys, always that balance you talked about in receivables. Are you able to get cash out of the country? Or was that an accumulation of -- basically because it's the highest free cash flowing asset in your portfolio currently? Is this -- are you able to get cash out of the country currently?
Stephen Riney: Yes. We are still able to get cash out of the country. That's not the problem.
Doug Leggate: Okay. My follow-up is, John, there are a few teasers in the deck about the status of Suriname moving towards potential hub development, I think it was the expression -- and you said you've got the results of at least the first appraisal well at Krabdagu. I wonder if I could ask a question like this. You said the result is in line with expectations. So what were the expectations? And what would you need to move forward by way of resource upside to the more than 800 that you identified in the deck today?
John Christmann: I would just say, Doug, we're still getting results from Krabdagu. We're in the buildup phase. To put things in perspective, I won't -- I'm not going to give you a predrill expectations, but the well was in line. But I will remind you that the Krabdagu 2 is 4.9 kilometers from the discovery well. So -- and Krabdagu 3 is 10.3 kilometers from the discovery well. So when you look at that map, sometimes you forget just how large of an area that is. And obviously, we're very pleased with the early data and the results we have from the appraisal well. But you know our history has been able to come back with connected volumes, and we're not ready to do that yet because we're still collecting pressure data.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Brackett at Bernstein Research.
Robert Brackett: I'll stick on the Egypt topic. One is just to refresh my memory that in Egypt, natural gas flows domestically sort of toward the Cairo Basin area, whereas oil tends to flow north and you export it and capture those revenues. Am I remembering that correctly? .
John Christmann: Yes.
Robert Brackett: Okay. The follow-up would be, you mentioned that to expect Egypt to be flattish 2Q versus 1Q. You mentioned production disruptions, some of which are temporary. Am I being too much of a lawyer to suggest that some of those are not temporary? And could you maybe give some color in terms of the cadence of getting oilier through the year? You've guided 60% oil for Q1 rising towards 64% for a full year average?
John Christmann: Yes. Bob, I'd say the first thing is, you know we've got a very large asset base area that stretches really from Cairo, almost to be. And we've got a number of fields, and I'll let Dave walk through some of the temporary things and then another minor issue.
David Pursell: Yes. So counselor, when we think about this, -- the capital program is performing as expected. So new wells and recompletes, those are on track. We've had slightly lower base production. So a series of things, and we'll highlight a couple of the big ones. We have an unplanned downtime at a gas plant, which will impact condensate production. We've had some ESP failures on some of our larger oil producers. Those are the temporary issues -- we've done some injection conversions taking producers to waterflood injection and that takes some time to see the oil production benefit from those. And then one of our mature fields, our field experienced an increase in water cut late first quarter. And put that in perspective, it's a 3,000 barrel a day field that's now producing close to 1,000 barrels a day. So it's not a big producer, but on the margin, that loss of 2,000 barrels a day impacted second quarter. It actually had a slight impact on the first quarter as well. So when we look at the second quarter, we just felt like given those events, it was probably appropriate to guide conservatively flat I'll tell you, the team is expecting to beat that. So we'll see, but we want to guide conservatively and we'll see as we go through the quarter some of the temporary issues will get back. I think it's important to highlight given the pace of new well drills, the quality of those wells, the recompletes, we remain confident in our ability to grow production in the back half of the year. So no change to guidance for '23.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charles Meade at Johnson Rice.
Charles Meade: John, I wondered if we could talk a little bit about the time line for these -- the Krabdagu appraisal wells. And maybe I was -- maybe I was off on the wrong track, but I thought we were going to get the -- some of these appraisal results a little earlier. But I found myself wondering maybe these wells, you've designed them to be eventual producers, and so they took longer to drill. So could you comment on, I guess, both of those things, what the time line is and whether the current time line is -- fits with what you expected and whether these are going to be producers and when you think you'll be in a position to share that connected volume investment.
John Christmann: Yes, Charles, I don't know where you got any ideas on time line because it wouldn't have been from us, but just because Total is operating. I would say the Krabdagu 2 moved on pretty much as expected. We're just in a period now where we're gaining data through the buildup. And so that is the most important information in terms of connected volumes. I will say the Krabdagu 3 well is running a little behind, but that also was a brand-new rig that was brought in the basin. And so there's been some fits and starts on the drilling of the third well. So I wouldn't read too much into that other than it just is taking a little longer than anticipated.
Charles Meade: Okay. And then going back to U.S. onshore in natural gas specifically, I want to commend to you guys before turning the dial back on that. It's -- I know it may be -- sometimes seems easier to do from seats like mine than the actual reality ever for you guys. But if we -- to your comments about being bullish on the longer-term outlook for natural gas, what -- can you give us a sense of what kind of price or what -- or how long at a certain price you would need to see natural gas before you would want to turn the dial back up on U.S. lean gas activity?
John Christmann: As we said in the prepared remarks, we're seeing good results on the program there. There's no reason to invest the capital today into this price environment. And so I think we want to see the infrastructure kind of get resolving it through this and feel like we're in a good place because we're making long-term investment decisions here. I'm very pleased with the results but we want a clear pathway on a more constructive price environment for gas.
Stephen Riney: Yes. And -- if I can just remind people also, John, we sell all of our gas produced in the Permian Basin in the Permian Basin. And so we're getting Waha or El Paso Permian prices for that gas. And we have our transport obligations to the Gulf Coast, but we buy gas and sell that on the Gulf Coast. We make that margin regardless of whether we produce a molecule of gas in the Permian or not. So everything has to be evaluated on the basis of we're selling this at Waha, not at the Gulf Coast.
Charles Meade: Right. But no -- nothing you're prepared to share about what Waha needs to be for some duration before you decide to put dollars back there?
Stephen Riney: Well, I think the simple thing would be to say that Waha has to be attractive enough to compete with more oil drilling right next door.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng at Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng: Gentlemen, can we go back into Permian? It seems that you're going to maintain 5 rigs and you're not going to do additional well in Alpine High. Should we assume in the second half, the number of wells you're going to bring on in the Permian is going to be higher than what you previously assumed? I think previously, based on your fourth quarter presentation, it looks like we may be talking about 22 wells in the third quarter and 10 wells in the fall. Should we assume it's going to be higher? Also then, in the second quarter, with 21 well, we thought the production will be higher than what you saw here. Is it the timing of the well coming on stream? Is winning in the -- in the quarter?
John Christmann: Yes, Paul, I'll let Dave jump in. But it is timing. We said most of the wells came on late in the first quarter in the Permian. And then effectively, your well counts are going to be pretty similar because we're dropping the gas-weighted drilling in the Permian, and we're adding some oil weighting. So it shouldn't have a big impact on the numbers, I wouldn't believe. But Dave, I'll let you...
David Pursell: Yes. In calendar year '23, it won't have a big number. The numbers we're looking at are a little bit higher than what you have, Paul, but not materially. And I think when you look at the 21 wells in the second quarter, they're big pads, and those pads come online. The Delaware pad, for example, is 11 wells on our Titus acquisition. And so we'll be bringing that online. It will come on at pace, but back-end weighted towards the end of the quarter, not the beginning.
Paul Cheng: Okay. And on the second question, the gross production for Egypt, can you just remind us then what is your full year expectation now? And also over the next several years, what kind of budget and what kind of growth rate that you have in mind on the gross production for that?
David Pursell: Yes. Paul, we had talked about 10% exit to exit on gross in Egypt, and the goal would be to, in the next couple of years, think about something in that range.
Paul Cheng: And what's the risk -- what's the biggest risk that you will not be able to achieve that for this year?
David Pursell: For this year?
Paul Cheng: Yes. certainly the first quarter second quarter is definitely, I suppose that is below what you've been looking at. And so you need to step up. And some of the challenge seems it's going to totally go away. So I mean, how big is the cushion when you're talking about 10% year-over-year exit rate?
David Pursell: Yes. I think for us, Paul, we have pretty good visibility on -- we have really good visibility on the program, and that program consists of new well drilling as well as recompletions. And both of those have a significant impact on the ability to grow production. So we have -- again, we still have confidence in our ability to hit that growth rate.
Paul Cheng: And do you have a budget that you can share for the next several years, we need to related to Egypt to achieve that plan?
David Pursell: We haven't shared that yet, Paul.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann at Truist Securities.
Neal Dingmann: John, my first question is on capital discipline, specifically. Really just in broad strokes, wondering how you all think about managed [indiscernible]. Is this more to insure you're generating sort of a cash flow in a bottle tape like we're in? Or do you think more about -- maybe ensure that you do not complete any wells that won't be high return threshold?
John Christmann: I mean you're cutting out a little bit on the question. So I didn't -- I think I -- it's about capital discipline. I'd say, I think, in general we feel good about where we are. Most of our capital costs are under contract. So it's about cost control and execution. We've made some choices to move some things around and you're seeing the impacts of those. And that's some of the flexibility of the portfolio. But everything is within line and really, we don't plan to drill wells that we wouldn't want to complete. And that's why you see us kind of curtailing the drilling in the gas-weighted programs in the U.S.
Neal Dingmann: Great details. And then my second, just on OFS inflation. We've heard a number of people talk about domestic softness. Just wondering if you've seen the something some of your international areas.
John Christmann: I would just say it's early, right? Everything is still under contract. I think where you'd start to see that as we start looking at, thinking about the '24 pricing and so forth, as you start pricing that in towards the middle of the year into next year. But right now, as you know, the cost structure always lags. And so we haven't seen any real direct softness today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram at JPMorgan Securities.
Arun Jayaram: Maybe, Steve, I want to ask you a little bit about the working capital build in the quarter in Egypt in the U.S. and just thoughts on the drivers of that. And would you expect that to reverse in 2Q over the balance of the year?
Stephen Riney: Yes. Arun. Yes, as I've indicated earlier, there was a $500 million working capital increase. $300 million of that was because of a paydown of accrued compensation obligations that were accrued through the 2022 calendar year, and $100 million of that was due to the paydown of other payables, other accounts payable. And then there were a bunch of other small items, ups and downs, that amounted to the full $500 million. And I did indicate that buried within that was the $180 million increase in Egypt accounts receivable. I think that most of that is going to reverse during 2023.  As every quarter, we accrue the incentive compensation that will be payable at the -- in the first quarter of the following year. So a lot of that's just going to reaccrue as we go through calendar year 2023.
Arun Jayaram: Great. And just my follow-up, maybe for David. David, in order to hit, call it, the midpoint of the full year oil guide, the business would have to average oil production in the upper 160s for the back half of the year. Just -- it sounds like your 2Q guide is a little conservative. But maybe if you could help us walk through and give us comfort on hitting those levels because the midpoint is 159 for oil.
David Pursell: Are we -- we're talking Egypt gross?
Arun Jayaram: No, just full year oil or the component.
David Pursell: Yes. So I think there's a -- if you -- without getting into the granularity of each asset, we feel confident in the ability to hit the Egypt exit to exit. The U.S. is going to grow. We have 21 wells coming online in the second quarter. We have more than that in the third quarter. A fair number of the wells that were brought online in the first quarter were 3 milers that were brought on towards the end of the quarter. So we feel good about the U.S. ability to execute. And then on the North Sea, which is kind of because of the EPL, everyone's kind of forgot about that, but we're actually having a pretty good operating success so far this year in the North Sea, both with platform operating efficiency. But we also brought on a really nice well at the end of the first quarter, and we have another well to store. It's the last subsea well that the Ocean Patriot drilled. It will be online here relatively quickly. That's going to be a little bit higher gas mix, which in the North Sea is not a bad thing right now. So we feel really comfortable with our ability to hit the portfolio growth targets.
Operator: Our next question comes from Leo Mariani at Ross MKM.
Leo Mariani: Just a question here on Suriname. Obviously, you guys are still going through the appraisal process at Krabdagu, but perspective [indiscernible] oil there, if you look at it in the radio and what you've already done appraisal wise at [indiscernible] are kind of enough to move forward with the development of a nice pool of oil here?
John Christmann: Yes, you're cutting out for most of your questions. So I think it's -- do we have enough. And I think the answer is, as we've said all along with Krabdagu, we're looking at an oil hub, which incorporates both Sapakara and Krabdagu. And the thing we've been focused on is a scope and scale right. So at this point, it's all I'll say the connected original in place. We put in the documents this morning does not include the appraisal work from Krabdagu yet. So we're making good progress.
Leo Mariani: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the U.S. side, Alpine High, you got 3 wells. You kind of mentioned that you're pleased with the progress. I was hoping to maybe get little more color on those 3 wells in terms of maybe how long you've been flow testing? And then I guess, is there any update on the Austin Chalk for APA?
John Christmann: At this point, no update on the Chalk. And on the Alpine wells, we're flowing them back at constrained rates, but we're very pleased with the deliverability and the early results.
Operator: Our next question comes from Roger Read at Wells Fargo Securities.
Roger Read: Yes. I guess maybe follow up a little bit on some of the oilfield inflation, deflation issues and broaden it beyond the U.S. to take a look at what the currency issues might portend for the cost structure in Egypt. Or does that not matter given the overall structure of the contract there in terms of the net barrel performance?
John Christmann: Well, number one, there's not a lot of competition for rigs or services in Egypt, right? So we've seen pretty stable cost with the devaluation that's actually helped cost structure now. But as I said earlier, we are assisting our nationals and doing some things to help with the inflation.
Roger Read: So you wouldn't expect a net reduction given like you said, kind of devaluation issues.
John Christmann: No, not big. Not big.
Roger Read: Okay. And then in the U.S., you mentioned obviously contract structure in place. But I was just curious, are you looking at indexed contracts? When is the next time we should see any potential for an inflection up or down in terms of the next contract rollover as we think about the rigs and the services?
John Christmann: We kind of keep a portfolio where some are on long term, some are on short and some are multiyear. And so it's a constant process of rejigging those, and that's kind of underway now and will continue. But it's not going to have a near-term material impact on our current cost structure of this year's capital program. So it will really start to show up in the $24 next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum at TD Cowen.
David Deckelbaum: I just wanted to follow up a little bit on just Alpine High. The decision, obviously, to reduce activity there makes sense in light of commodity pricing. But as we think about fulfilling contracts like the Cheniere contract and others, are you content to just fill with third-party gas? Or is there a certain level of organic gas that you'd like to maintain out of Alpine High as you get into '24?
Stephen Riney: No. For quite some time, our is that every molecule of gas we produce in the Permian Basin is sold in the Permian Basin, and our trading organization will take care of both the long-haul transport obligations through purchasing and selling gas, and we'll also take care of the Cheniere contract with purchased gas.
David Deckelbaum: Got it. And then maybe if I could just wrap up on Suriname. I guess as we think about moving towards an investment decision, do you anticipate that we'll have enough data points, just given some of the Krabdagu delineation and appraisal work in combination with we already know at Sapakara to reach a decision this year. Is that in line with your internal thinking?
John Christmann: I would just say we're waiting to see results, right? I mean we're making good progress. As I've said a number of times, we're kind of focused on potential scope and scale of what that first project would look like as there's an incentive for everybody to size upwardly. But we'll know when we get there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin MacCurdy at Pickering Energy Partners.
Unidentified Analyst: There's been much discussion in this earnings season about potential deflation on shale well costs, but I'm curious what you're seeing on the international side. Outside of the increased receivables, what is your view on raw materials and services in Egypt and the North Sea? And how is that trending relative to last year?
John Christmann: Well, in general, we -- like I said a few minutes ago, we don't have a lot of competition for services in Egypt. So it really kind of goes with the commodity fuels up, for the most part, chemicals. In the North Sea, we're going to be popping the Ocean Patriot. So if anything, capital spending is dropping there, but nothing major, nothing surprising in the way of the international service side.
David Deckelbaum: Great. And congratulations on reducing your 2023 CapEx budget. Kind of going back to the Ocean Patriot rig, are the savings from dropping that rig already built into your updated budget you released yesterday? Or have those savings effectively been redirected to the Permian?
John Christmann: They were in the plant from early on them because we plan to drop that rig midyear at the start of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs & Co.
Neil Mehta: John, as you started off in your remarks, there's a lot of uncertainty in the near term as it relates to the commodity price and the global economy. And so I'd love your perspective on how you as an organization are building downside resilience if there is a harder landing. And what are the lessons learned from experiences in 2015 and 2020 that you can carry forward?  And one of the things that I think you guys have made terrific progress on since COVID has been really cleaning up the balance sheet and taking out $3 billion worth of debt. So maybe you could speak to where you are in that route.
John Christmann: Well, I'll say a few comments and I'll let Steve jump in on the balance sheet. But I'd say, first and foremost, the best flexibility you have is being able to reduce your activity. And you've seen us do that with the lean gas drilling in the U.S. You've seen us do that in the North Sea. So when it's time to stop investing, you need to stop investing. And those are the lessons we've learned. Stay focused on cost and maintain that flexibility to invest in the projects that are going to continue to generate the long-term returns.
Stephen Riney: Yes. I'd just add that in the last two -- quarter years, we've reduced debt by $3.2 billion while also buying back $2.4 billion worth of equity. The biggest thing, I think we accomplished in the bond reduction, the debt reduction flows in the near term. And in the near-term maturities, we've got 30% of our bond debt matures here in the next -- well, between now and 2030. And only around $350 million of that matures in the next 5 years. So we don't have much of a runway to worry about.  And then 70% of our debt is 2037 and beyond. We've got some -- we've got a really good profile for debt maturities as well. And then the last thing I would add is cost management. John talked about the ability to reduce the capital budget, but we've been very disciplined on managing our cost structure as well. Keeping that low helps certainly build resiliency.
Neil Mehta: Can you remind us where you are in terms of getting to investment grade with all the agencies? And given what you've done with the balance sheet, I feel like you're getting close [indiscernible]. So any perspective on
Stephen Riney: Yes. Maybe you could kind of help us next time we go talk to the rating agencies, but appreciate that. But we feel like -- well, we talked to the rating agencies at least twice a year. We are investment grade with Fitch now, and we're on positive outlook for an increase to investment grade with S&P and Moody's. We have talked to them recently. We'll see what happens.  I think we -- as you've kind of alluded to there, I think we are due for an upgrade. Hopefully, that comes in 2023. And I think we trade -- I mean we benchmarked very well compared to some of our peers that are already investment grade. So I think we are due for that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon at TPH & Co.
Jeoffrey Lambujon: Maybe a few on the Permian ex Alpine High. First one is just on what your outlook is for productivity out of your Midland and Delaware this year just relative to the last few years and relative to internal expectations for what's left on inventory and then what aspects of the program operationally you're spending the most time on today from a design perspective. I think you noted the 3 milers earlier, I'd be curious on how you think about the mix of those in the program over time and how much inventory that might apply to and, again, if you're thinking about any other areas we're spending time on.
David Pursell: Yes. So Jeffrey, good questions. This is Dave. On the 3 miler question first, we tend to like to drill 3 milers where the acreage is set up for that. It's very capital efficient. We've been able to execute those really well, both on the drilling and the completion. So where it's possible, we'll do that. But I think you should think about the majority of our portfolio or 2-mile laterals. So the typical well is going to be a 2-miler. On productivity, we continue to -- the team's work and study and try to squeeze out productivity gains on every pad we get on -- and we continue to have pretty good results with that.  So we're -- I don't know how you think about that externally if we've got some -- a pretty good process in place and feel comfortable with it. We've got a good methodical pace of drilling and completions and are pleased with that pace at this point.
Jeoffrey Lambujon: Great, Dave. My next one is just on the sustainability of that productivity that you're seeing today, you could frame inventory depth as you look at the Midland and Delaware individually if we just kind of assume maybe the current pace for starters on an annual basis. And then I'd also be interested in how to think about steady state quarterly run rate activity as we think about next year, just given the shape of the program this year that was referenced earlier in the Q&A with that dynamic of Q3 completion count in the low 20s and Q4 going into the low teens or a little bit lower exiting the year.
David Pursell: Yes. So inventory, we've consistently said we've got line of sight kind of through the end of the decade. And we keep adding things to it. And that number will move around over time. At the current cadence, I think you could look at the second and third quarter activity pace and roll that through into '24, but we haven't really given guidance yet on '24 on what the capital program and activity would look like. We're assuming that we kind of hold serve on productivity gains. But again, the aspiration is to continue to squeeze more out of each completion.
Operator: I would now like to turn it back to John Christmann for closing remarks.
John Christmann: Thank you. Before closing the call, I want to leave you with the following thoughts. First, our asset teams are executing well. Safety performance continues to be good, and contributions from our drilling programs are strong. We are managing the portfolio to optimize returns and near-term cash flow and keenly focused on cost control. Second, we continue to make good progress on our appraisal program in Suriname and look forward to sharing more information in the future.  Lastly, we remain committed to returning at least 60% of annual free cash flow to investors through dividends and buybacks and believe our stock is a compelling investment. We plan to participate in a number of investor events over the next 2 months and look forward to seeing you. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-23 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by. Welcome to APA Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2022 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Gary Clark: Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's fourth quarter and full-year 2022 financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development, Tracey Henderson, Executive Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 15 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with the previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call today, I will review our key accomplishments in 2022, comment on fourth quarter performance, and provide an overview of our 2023 plans and objectives. Ahead of the pandemic, in 2019, we established a pragmatic long-term plan for our business that emphasized returns-focused investment, strengthening the balance sheet, right-sizing the organization and activity levels to deliver moderate sustainable production growth, conservative budgeting, and the selective pursuit of differentiated opportunities for value creation, most notably, exploration. The world oil demand and commodity price dislocations that followed in 2020 and 2021 required some difficult and necessary actions to preserve our business. After a few years of hard work, we have returned to and are delivering on this long-term plan. In 2022, we generated a second highest annual free cash flow in the company's 68-year history, which we allocated primarily to debt reduction and cash returns to our shareholders. We also increased our rig activity to a pace that is now capable of generating sustained production growth in both Egypt and the U.S. Some of the more notable achievements of the past year include free cash flow generation of $2.5 billion, 66% of which was returned to shareholders. The repurchase of $1.4 billion of common stock at an average price of less than $40 per share and the doubling of our annual dividend, a $1.4 billion or 23% reduction in outstanding bond debt, an increase in adjusted oil production from the fourth quarter 2021 to the fourth quarter 2022, which represents our first exit rate to exit rate oil production increase since 2018. The successful integration of our Texas Delaware Basin tuck-in acquisition, which compliments our legacy Delaware position and continues to exceed expectations. And importantly, on Block 58 in Suriname, the flow test of two appraisal wells at Sapakara South, which indicated a combined resource in place of more than 600 million barrels of low GOR oil. At Krabdagu, the discovery well was also successfully flow tested. An appraisal is now underway with two rigs. Additionally, in Block 53, the first oil discovery was made at Baja, which is on trend with Krabdagu. And lastly, on the ESG front, routine upstream flaring in Egypt was reduced by more than 40%. This is a significant step toward our goal of eliminating 1 million tons of annualized CO2 equivalent emissions by the end of 2024. Moving on to fourth quarter results. Following some operational delays in Egypt and unexpected facilities downtime in the North Sea in the first three quarters of the year, we ended 2022 on a strong note. Fourth quarter production and costs were in line with guidance, while CapEx for the period was slightly above expectations due to some small shifts in activity timing. U.S. production exceeded guidance on continued strong performance from our Midland and Delaware Basin oil properties. Oil volumes in Egypt strengthened as we continue to improve drilling efficiencies and project execution and North Sea production benefited from a substantial improvement in facilities runtime. Looking forward to 2023, we will continue to focus on managing costs and driving efficiencies while also taking advantage of the optionality within our portfolio to respond to commodity price movements. Specifically, with regard to the recent and substantial drop in natural gas prices, we are managing the portfolio for cash flow and not production volume. Accordingly, our growth in 2023 will be entirely driven by oil. We are reiterating our capital budget of $2 billion to $2.1 billion, which is consistent with what we indicated back in early November. We believe this appropriately reflects potential inflationary impacts for the coming year and remain confident in our ability to deliver within this range. At this investment level and assuming current strip prices, we anticipate year-over-year adjusted oil growth of more than 10% and BOE growth of 4% to 5%. This is consistent with the preliminary BOE guidance we discussed on our November call. Oil volumes in Egypt and the U.S. will be the primary contributors to growth more than offsetting a decrease in natural gas production in both regions. As we also noted on our November call, we are expecting a sequential decrease in U.S. production from fourth quarter to first quarter. This is primarily driven by our Permian Basin oil well completion cadence. However, natural gas curtailments at Alpine High and liquids volume reductions associated with ethane rejection during the month of January are also significant contributors. Importantly, our Permian oil well completion cadence will accelerate in the second half of February, which should lead to significantly higher U.S. oil production in the second quarter through the fourth quarter. Turning to the North Sea. We anticipate a moderate production rebound this year with three new wells coming online in the first half and shorter scheduled maintenance turnaround times. We plan to release the Ocean Patriot semi-submersible drilling rig around mid-year, following completion of a scheduled drilling campaign in the North Sea. The permanent reallocation of this capital to other areas is being evaluated as a recent tax changes in the UK have made returns less attractive than other investment opportunities within our portfolio. In Suriname, first half 2023 activity is focused on the two appraisal wells drilling at Krabdagu and subsequent flow testing. Following that, another exploration test on Block 58 is also planned. While average oil and gas prices are trending down relative to 2022, APA’s free cash flow this year should be bolstered by our gas sales contract with Cheniere. Steve will provide more detail around the expected impact of this contract in his remarks. We remain fully committed to returning at least 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders through a mix of dividends and share buybacks. Strengthening our balance sheet also remains a priority, and we anticipate that most or all of the free cash flow not returned to shareholders will be used to reduce debt. In closing, while the industry is experiencing considerable short-term oil and gas price volatility, we have a constructive outlook on the long-term supply and demand for hydrocarbons. Over the next several years, our plan is to maintain a relatively constant activity level yet remain flexible to shift capital within the portfolio to the highest value opportunities. Through the cycle, we also plan to continue allocating an appropriate percentage of our capital budget to high-quality differential exploration opportunities. APA’s investment case and portfolio are unique. Within the Permian Basin, we can allocate capital investment to oil or natural gas and generate growth from either or both commodities. Additionally, we hold considerable long-term gas transportation capacity, which our marketing team utilizes to purchase and resale third-party gas for a profit. We have gas sales to Cheniere commencing this summer that will provide long-term access to international index pricing. Our Egypt operations offer exposure to premium Brent oil prices, modernized PSC terms, and an opportunity to generate consistent growth in an area with tremendous potential. And in Suriname, our joint-venture partnership enables the appraisal and potential development of large scale projects on Block 58 with limited capital investment. We believe APA is well positioned to help profitably deliver hydrocarbons that the world needs for the next decade and beyond. We are committed to doing this while reducing carbon intensity and being good environmental stewards. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney.
Stephen Riney: Thanks, John. APA delivered very good financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full-year as we benefited from a strong albeit volatile price environment. For the last three months of 2022, consolidated net income was $443 million or $1.38 per diluted common share. As usual, these results include items that are outside of core earnings. The most significant of these items was a pre-tax charge of $157 million to increase the net contingent liability for decommissioning the former Fieldwood properties in the Gulf of Mexico. The increase reflects a combination of changes in cash flow during the life of the producing asset and estimated future decommissioning costs. This was partially offset by a $52 million pre-tax unrealized gain on derivatives and a $47 million release of evaluation allowance on deferred tax assets. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $476 million or $1.48 per diluted common share. During the fourth quarter, APA generated $360 million of free cash flow and repurchased more than 12 million shares of common stock, resulting in approximately 312 million shares outstanding at year-end. Underlying G&A costs for the quarter remained around $95 million. However, total G&A was $169 million, which was above our fourth quarter guidance. This was caused by an increase in anticipated incentive compensation plan payouts, as well as the recurring mark-to-market for previously accrued stock-based compensation that will be paid out in the future. These accruals also resulted in higher than expected LOE and exploration expense, though to a much lesser extent than G&A. Exploration expense was also elevated as we recorded $66 million of combined dry hole costs for the Awari prospect in Suriname and a non-commercial exploration well in the North Sea. Looking ahead to 2023, as John outlined, we expect continued production growth and strong free cash flow generation. At 2022 prices, free cash flow in 2023 would be about the same as 2022. Growing production volumes and cash flow from the Cheniere gas sales contract at current strip prices would offset the impact of higher taxes in the UK and the increased capital program. We will once again return a minimum of 60% of free cash flow to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends with the remaining 40% primarily used for reducing net debt. The gas sales contract with Cheniere will commence in the second half of 2023. We entered into the agreement in 2019 with the purpose of aligning aggregate financial outcomes with a more diversified portfolio of gas prices similar to the diversified oil prices we enjoy naturally through the portfolio. We are frequently asked about the contracts expected free cash flow and its sensitivity to movements in U.S. Gas and Global LNG prices. At current strip price levels, we project roughly $200 million of free cash flow contribution in the second half of 2023. If you want to put a range on annualized forward-looking free cash flows, let me give you two potential outcomes as realistic inputs. Assuming average prices of $20 LNG and $4 Houston Ship Channel, the expected annualized free cash flow would be approximately $500 million. Assuming higher average prices of $40 LNG and $6 Houston Ship Channel, the annualized free cash flow would increase to approximately $1.25 billion. It is important to note that these cash flow numbers include the costs incurred to purchase the gas to supply to Cheniere. Clearly, we believe there is substantial upside price exposure. Despite this, we will continue to plan and budget conservatively given the volatile gas price environment and the scale of associated changes in the cash flow profile. Turning now to income taxes. The UK recently increased its energy profits levy from 25% to 35% and extended the effective period through March of 2028. As a result, the combined statutory tax rate in the UK for 2023 is now 75%, and we expect this will be fairly close to our effective tax rate as well. With that, at current strip prices, we expect UK current tax expense of $550 million to $575 million this year. In the U.S., we do not expect to be subject to the 15% corporate alternative minimum tax in 2023 and therefore, anticipate no current federal income taxes for the year as accumulated tax losses more than offset projected taxable income. Please consult our financial and operational supplement for a full suite of guidance items for both first quarter and full-year 2023. To wrap up, 2022 was a year of great progress as we exceeded our minimum shareholder return commitment and significantly improved the balance sheet. We reduced outstanding bond debt by $1.4 billion while also returning 66% of free cash flow to shareholders and restoring the base annual dividend to $1 per share. Through the buyback program, we repurchased 10% of the company's outstanding shares at an attractive average price of roughly $39 per share. In 2023, we anticipate another strong financial performance with more share repurchases, more balance sheet deleveraging and more progress toward our objective of achieving an investment-grade rating with all of the rating agencies. We look forward to updating you as the year progresses. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Gary Clark.
Gary Clark: Thanks, operator. One quick administrative note, Steve Riney will not be available for Q&A as he unfortunately needs to attend to a family matter. So Ben Rodgers, our Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Midstream and Marketing has joined us and he will be able to address your questions related to financial topics and gas marketing and transportation. So we'll give it back to you operator for the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
John Freeman: Good morning, guys.
John Christmann: Good morning, John.
John Freeman: First topic, just looking at Egypt, obviously, a really, really solid quarter in 4Q. Nice to see the rig efficiency gains. I was looking at the success rate that you had in Egypt in 2022 versus the prior couple of years, and the success rate was meaningfully better about 85% average in 2022. And I guess I'm trying to get a sense of how much of that is maybe related to some of the seismic you had done a year ago? Or anything else you are doing in Egypt that would maybe indicate that, that higher success rate is sustainable going forward?
John Christmann: Yes, John, I'd say the program has been pretty constant. We drilled really a multitude of different well types, both on the development side and the exploration side. I think what you're seeing there is the impact from the modernization, there were some things that were not being pursued because of the modernized terms, and we're able to pull some of those forward and prioritize them. So you're running a little higher on the success rate as we get some of that low hanging fruit initially.
John Freeman: Great. And then a follow-up on looking at Suriname. Has the exploration well been identified where that will be after the two appraisal wells? And is the entirety of the 2023 plan, the two appraisals and the one exploration, which was kind of laid out in the presentation, we just want to think of it as you do the appraisals. I mean it's sort of a – let's see what comes of that and then determine the second half of the year sort of plan? Just a little bit more detail on Suriname, please.
John Christmann: Yes. I would just say today, we've got the two appraisal wells that we're drilling at Krabdagu, and that's going to take a good portion of the first part of the year, and that's where the priority is now. And then we do have one exploration slot that is still being worked and we're still debating with partner on which well that will be, but there are multiple wells identified. It's just a matter of which one. So for now, that is the plan. And obviously, we'll readdress that throughout the year.
John Freeman: Great. Thanks, John.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Jeanine Wai: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions.
John Christmann: You bet, Jeanine.
Jeanine Wai: Good morning, John. First question maybe just keeping along with John's on Suriname. The estimate for resource at Sapakara is now over 600 million barrels of oil in place. So I guess our question is, what's the confidence level of that estimate? And how much overall resource is required to get a project to FID, and we know you're doing a ton of appraisal at Krabdagu this year as well?
John Christmann: Yes. I mean in terms of the estimate at Sapakara, there's good confidence. We flow tested those volumes – is really high-quality rock. It's low GOR oil and really got one main sand package. So it's going to have a high recovery and it will be a big key component potentially of a future project. So we have great confidence there. And then we've got the two appraisal wells that are being drilled at Krabdagu right now. In terms of development size and so forth. As we've said, we're working towards a first project. And really, right now, it's premature to talk about anything pending the results of appraisal at Krabdagu, which we're very excited about and it's moving right along.
Jeanine Wai: Okay. We'll stay tuned for those appraisal results. Maybe moving to the U.S. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're managing the portfolio for cash flow and not production and so 23% is driven by oil this year. And so you also curtailed some Alpine High production in January. Can you provide any further color on what the price sensitivity is of natural gas curtailments at Alpine High? Thank you.
David Pursell: Yes. This is Dave Pursell. It's a good question. Our curtailments earlier in the year were relatively small, but when Waha – Waha has had a lot of volatility. So as we get down to low Waha basis, and sometimes it's going negative, so we're making those decisions daily and weekly. So it depends on dry gas versus wet gas. There's a lot that goes into it, but as we look at it now, we've been flowing Alpine, full out through most of January and February. So not going to give you a specific price marker, but we're looking at it, pretty extensively every day and every week with the marketing team.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.
Charles Meade: Good morning, John to you and the whole Apache team there. I wanted to ask a question about the Krabdagu appraisals. And I recognize that we still have to get the important data that those appraisals are designed to get with not just what you see in the logs, but with the flow test. But from my seat, and I think for most of the people outside looking in, you guys have – you have two – I guess you're about to have two appraisals ongoing. It really looks like you guys are trying to drive to get the data to get to a decision point in the near-term? And is that a fair inference to make?
John Christmann: I mean, Charles, we've prioritized the appraisal at Krabdagu right. And you saw us move from Sapakara with two appraisal wells there, and we're very pleased with those results. And Sapakara 2 kind of came in as we had projected and modeled and obviously anxious for the results at Krabdagu. And so it is fair to say. And its fact, we've prioritized the appraisal program right now.
Charles Meade: Right. Thank you for that, John. That's what we're trying to get to. And the second one, just a quick follow-up for me. How would you set our expectations on when we're going to hear about the Krabdagu flow test, both at the same time? Or what should we be thinking about?
John Christmann: Charles, I would just say that clearly, one of the wells is ahead of the second and the second one has been on location spudding any time now. So there will be a lag. And we'll just have to see what we decide to do and work with Total in terms of what we come back with and timing. But we're moving on both of those as quickly as possible, and it's very important information.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is now open.
Paul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
John Christmann: Good morning, Paul.
Paul Cheng: Two more questions. John, can you remind us that what is Alpine High role in your longer-term portfolio? I think at one point several years ago, you sort of write down edited then gas pipe become a little bit better, and I think you guys go back and sort of having – it seems like it's having a role in the long term. But how should we look at the Alpine High? And also, the second question is that I think you guys have not done any bolt-on acquisitions in the last 12, 18 months. Some of your peers has done so. How should we look at bolt-on acquisition for you guys over the next two or three years? Is that a – could pay a reasonable role or that you will be focusing more effort in exploration in Suriname and also that the activity level in Egypt. Thank you.
John Christmann: So two really good questions, Paul. I mean the first thing I would say is as Alpine High is a nice piece of our Permian portfolio, and we look at part of the Delaware Basin. And it's one of the levers we have, the optionality to allocate capital to. We've got really three wells that we're going to be bringing on during the first quarter. And then you'll see kind of a break and then we've got five wells that will be coming on year-end. But it is something we can toggle and we'll tend to leverage that. And what you've seen us this year is given the weakness in Waha and U.S. gas, there's no reason to be bringing on incremental volumes, but it's really about prepping for the opportunity and having that optionality when you look at 2024 and beyond some of the basin bottlenecks open up. So it will be a toggle for us, and it's a place we have the optionality to invest and we plan to use this such and that's been the game plan. I think when you step back in your second question related to bolt-on acquisitions, we did do our first acquisition last year in the Delaware, a very nice tuck-in acquisition. It was one that – we're constantly in the market looking at things as is we have assets in the market. We typically wait to talk about things until there's a transaction or something to do. The tuck-in we did last year is something that's been exceeding our acquisition forecast, something we're very happy with, and it's now integrated into our Delaware package in our Delaware assets. So I think it's something you just got to monitor. I mean if you've got a handle on your current inventory. You've got a handle on costs and if there are things that we think we can add at attractive cost where we can drive incremental returns, then we're not opposed to doing that. But it's been a high bar, and that's why we've really only done one transaction over the last couple of years. And we're going to continue to drive a balanced portfolio. We are emphasizing exploration with the program we've got in Suriname, but we also do a lot of just blocking and tackling things elsewhere around the globe.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Douglas Leggate: Hi. John, good morning. Hey. Good morning, everybody.
John Christmann: Good morning, Doug.
Douglas Leggate: John, I've tried this couple of times in the past, but I'm going to try it again. Suriname recovery factors, given your post permeability is world-class rock, obviously, can you give us some idea of what you think that looks like? And if I may reference the more than $800 million as opposed to the $600 million, it looks like we're heading to a joint potential Sapakara, Krabdagu development, what should we think in terms of timing and scale of an FID?
John Christmann: Great question, Doug. And there's a lot of work we've done, and we have a lot of confidence in what we put out, but there's also a lot of work left to do. So I will talk about give you a little bit of color on Sapakara and then I'm going to bring Dave in if he wants to add anything, you've really got two areas – you are correct. We are working towards with our partner, potentially a development hub where you would be bringing in both Krabdagu and Sapakara. They are a little different in terms of the makeup and so forth. Sapakara is predominantly one package, really, really high-quality rock when you're talking low GOR oil, 1,100 GOR oil and you're talking 1.3 to 1.5 Darcy rock, one nice blocky sand, you're going to have high recoveries. And that's really all I'll say at this point. You'd want to get into feed study and do more work before we come out with more specifics there. So some of the questions you're asking are things that will come later. And then Krabdagu is – there's three targets there. It is the incremental $200 million that you've referenced there, and we're in the process of appraising that. You've got a range of GORs there depending on the zones. And so the work we're doing to understand those and quantify those is really important to determining potential scale and scope. So all things underway. We prioritize it, which is why you've got two rigs there. And we're anxiously awaiting those as well because it's going to have an impact on scope and scale.
Douglas Leggate: Thank you for that, John. I guess we're not going to get the FID timing question, but I told you I would try again. I'm torn as to whether I ask my second on Suriname as well. I think I'm going to, so let me try this. Did you find an oil water contact on the second appraisal well at Sapakara. And I guess what I'm really trying to think of is the focus, obviously, is on these two, but they're still, if I recollect, multiple years left in exploration program. How do you think about the broader risk of the basin at this point? Oil window, obviously, prospects specific risk and so on, to generally characterize it for us, is this going to be one and done? Or do you see capacity for a longer-term exploration development program in the basin?
John Christmann: Well, a bunch of questions in there. So I'll try to answer all of them to the extent I can. One, Sapakara South 2 was an up dip appraisal. So I think that was important in terms of confirming what we confirm there. If you go over to Krabdagu, I'll remind you, Waha in Block 53 was a discovery of a down-dip lobe and the Krabdagu fairway. So there are multiple levels and that's part of what you're driving at. There's also a pretty good chance we're appraising updip at Krabdagu as well, which is always a good thing when you're appraising. We see a lot of potential. I mean if you look at where we are today and the area we're working, we've had great success. There is more beyond just Sapakara and Krabdagu that could also go into a potential hub. And then if you look on the outboard side of the block, you get further out, we've had a working petroleum system, and we found hydrocarbons. The trick has been trap and seal as you get out there. So I do believe we will have an ongoing program in Suriname as there is a lot of prospectivity.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist. Your line is open.
Neal Dingmann: Good morning, John. Thanks for the time. John, my first question, really just a broader one on shareholder return or specific to maybe capital allocation. The last couple of quarters, you all were pretty adamant about talking about maybe a minimum amount of buyback given still what I certainly agree with a cheap stock price. I'm just wondering, do you all still feel like that? I mean, you have kind of a minimum level that you think about going forward for this year or this quarter? I mean, I'm just wondering from a shareholder or buyback perspective, if you're able to frame anything up?
John Christmann: No, I think we have – good question. We have great confidence in the framework we put forward. And I'll underscore, when we say on the buybacks, we'll do a minimum of 60%. As you saw last year, we were able to execute on that. We feel strongly about it today as well, and that's what you'll see us do. By nature, things are back-end loaded last year just because of the volatility in the commodity price. We were active, I think, in 10 out of 12 months on the buyback. And you'll see us taking similar approach this year. But it is definitely a minimum of 60%. That gives us ample on the additional 40 to address balance sheet. So yes, we – I'll underscore that.
Neal Dingmann: No, great point. Okay. And then clearly, just a second question on domestic activity. It's been asked a little bit, but I'm just wondering, you all mentioned having the two Southern Midland Basin, the three Delaware rigs. How fluid is this? Could this change depend on prices, and I'm just – or even more activity in that newer Titus area? Just wanted for plans for remainder that maybe more second half of the year?
John Christmann: Yes. I would just say we're in a really good cadence in the Southern Midland Basin, and you're seeing it in our results because we're planning pads way down the road, and it gives us time to really execute and think about how to maximize the NPV and the returns. And so that two-rig program has been a good cadence for us at Southern Midland Basin. We've got three in the Delaware, and that's where's flexibility. And you've seen from the forecast, we're shifting those more to the oil-weighted projects in the Delaware and that's the luxury we have of our portfolio today. And then we've integrated Titus in – so it's really just part of our Delaware program and it's ours. So.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Roger Read: Yes. Good morning.
John Christmann: Good morning, Roger.
Roger Read: Good morning. Happy to finally show up here. One quick question for you on your comments about the outlook for the agreement with Cheniere, the range of 500 to 1.25. When we look at it between the ship channel price and the European price which one do you see more sensitivity to? In other words, we see a big move in prices here or could you slump per and big moves, we expect continued volatility over in Europe, which is the waiting towards?
John Christmann: It's going to be more on the global and TTF or JKM, but I'll let Ben provide any additional details.
Ben Rodgers: That's right. I mean there's a lot of variables that go into it. We've seen weakness in the ship channel this year, mainly from Freeport LNG being offline and just generally milder weather. So a lot of domestic variables that are impacting the Houston Ship Channel. But to John's point, with the war in Ukraine and a milder winter over in Europe, I think it was one of the – only the second or third warmest winter that they've had over there in close to 50 years. It's just going to insert a lot of volatility there. The good thing though, as we look at it, you just kind of step back, we think it does provide very significant potential uplift to our free cash flow numbers. And we have that inherently on the oil side by selling our North Sea and Egyptian oil barrels at Brent-based pricing. And it's one of the reasons we entered into this contract in 2019 was to get access to the global gas market as well.
Roger Read: Yes, it makes sense. The follow-up question I have is I understand the reason for reducing investment in gas in the near term. But as you look at your let's call it, guidance goals, expectations to deliver oil volume growth this year. What should we be paying attention to as the risk factors on that things that which I guess could cause you to come in underneath or any of the other issues, as you mentioned, kind of like well cadence, stuff like that?
John Christmann: I mean it's exactly those things, Roger. But I mean we've got good confidence in the program, and it's underpinned the two onshore areas with Egypt and Permian. But it will be that very thing. It's the turn-in lines and the timing. And you're seeing that a little bit with the first quarter because we only had four wells in the U.S. Fourth quarter of last year, and they are late, one Permian, three Chalk. So a lot of that's going to be driven by the function of just what's the timing on the execution. And when you're running five rigs in the U.S., it's going to be lumpy. And then Egypt, it took us a little bit of time to kind of get our legs under us with the 17-rig program. But I mean that's going to – those are the key things to watch. But we have good confidence in our projections.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Neil Mehta: Yes. Thanks, so much. Maybe, John, the first question is around capital efficiency. The spend budget came in a little bit lower than where consensus was. So maybe you could talk about what you're seeing real time, both international and in the U.S. in terms of inflation. Have you seen any green shoots that this period of immense inflation is starting to move back into your direction?
John Christmann: Yes, Neil, a good question. I would say we spend a lot of time trying to stay about a year ahead of our programs and so with our contracts and things because that gives us the visibility in terms of the spend. And so today, a lot of what you're seeing is contracts based on the back half of last year pricing. So I think it's a little premature from our perspective to be seeing any softness tied to the commodity price. I think if the price stays where it is today, that is one of the upsides of the plan as you're going to see cost structures follow. They just tend to lag but they will follow the deck. It just takes a little bit of time to play catch-up. So nothing there to really comment on in terms of green shoots or anything at this point.
Neil Mehta: That's fair, John. The follow-up is the North Sea, maybe you can talk about the impact of the 75% tax rate. How it's affected your willingness to invest in the region. There was obviously the Ocean Patriot release as well. And any comments you have around tax rate broadly would be helpful?
John Christmann: Yes. I would just say that it's made the North Sea less competitive relative within our portfolio. And so as we look at that still an asset that we're going to manage for cash flow and we'll get good performance there, and we're going to continue to invest in asset integrity and maintenance and all the things we need to do environmentally, safety like we always will. But longer-term incremental dollars that we have alternatives to put in other places, you're seeing us make that decision just because there's more attractive places to put that. And so it's made the North Sea less competitive on a relative basis within our portfolio. And that's why you're seeing us drop the Ocean Patriot rig later this year.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum with Cowen. Your line is now open.
David Deckelbaum: Hey, John. Thanks for the time today.
John Christmann: You bet.
David Deckelbaum: Just wanted to ask on sort of the future expectations for Egypt growth. I know since the modernization of the PSC and the ramp up to 17 rigs now, the view was that this could be sort of a multiyear growth opportunity. I understand the beginning of this year, production obviously declines and then ramped throughout the year. It seems like a combination of till cadence, but also was curious if there's infrastructure challenges driving some of that production curve. And then what we should expect once we're 10% higher in the fourth quarter of 2023 going into 2024 and beyond there?
John Christmann: No. I think you'll see a pretty robust program in Egypt. The thing you have to recognize here, we've got two factors going on. You have a big discovery that was predominantly gas and [indiscernible] that's starting to decline. And that's why you're seeing the oil growth, which is where the drilling program with the 17 rigs are focused in Egypt. So you'll see that oil mix is what's growing in Egypt as well, and that's what's underpinning that program. But it's an onshore multi-rig program. And it's a little bit different from the unconventional that you folks have gotten used to in the U.S. We're at shale and you can do pad math. But the nice thing is, this is conventional rock that flows at you pretty hard and fast and sets up smaller developments but very impactful material developments. So good confidence in the long-term curve there. We've been in Egypt since 1994, and a lot of good confidence in that.
David Deckelbaum: I appreciate that, John. And just my second one, just on Suriname. It sounds like we're obviously waiting for the appraisal results from Krabdagu and the intention to potentially build out a hub there. I guess does that necessarily preclude Sapakara being developed independently? Or would you view this as you kind of need to combine both Sapakara and Krabdagu into one hub system to maximize economics and that Sapakara wouldn't necessarily support a development on its own?
John Christmann: I'll just say your – both us and our partner are motivated to get the scope and scale correct from the get-go. And the larger the project, the larger the boat, the better the economics are going to be. And so there's no reason to try to get into – could you – because what we're really looking at is to how you get the scope and scale right. And that's why we're looking at trying to combine these.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with ROTH. Your line is now open.
Leo Mariani: Hi, guys. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the North Sea. Obviously, you're making the decision to drop the rig here later this year. It certainly sounds like that tax rate is going to be separately high for quite a few years. Should we expect the result of that rig being dropped is it going to kind of accelerate some of the production decline? Should we expect to see kind of steady declines on asset maybe starting in 2024 and beyond? Just trying to get a sense of what the ramifications are of the less activity?
John Christmann: Yes. I would just say, in general, it doesn't really change the abandonment time frames as we model that out today. And really, you look at this year, not much impact from the Ocean Patriot. It was drilling some things that are bigger impact subsea wells that take time to come into play. So it does have an impact, start to see a little bit in 2024 or 2025 and beyond, but it doesn't really drive – I mean we're still looking at early 2030s for both 40s and Barrel. And when we bought the 40s asset, I'll go back and remind you. When we bought that in 2003 from BP, it was scheduled to come out of ground in 2012. And so here we are more than a decade longer 12 – 10 years, 11 years longer. And still looking at close to another decade. So there's still good productivity in life there. We're just going to manage it for cash flow and be very prudent about the future investments.
Leo Mariani: That's helpful. And then just jumping over to the U.S. Just wanted to get a sense – is there anything at all planned in the Austin Chalk in 2023? I know you guys had some wells that kind of came on late last year. So if there's any update you have on that asset. And then also just to follow up on Alpine High a little bit. Do you guys really – it sounds like you're kind of viewing that as somewhat of optionality on the gas market in the next several years and then hopefully that gas market will improve. But do you guys have long-term designs on using Alpine High as a feedstock for some of these Gulf Coast LNG facilities?
John Christmann: I mean the thing I would say is recognize the contract with Cheniere is a separate deal. It's a corporate level deal. We buy gas and ship channel. So it's separate and aside from what our equity gas that we produce. So we sell that in basin at Waha and prices at Waha are going to dictate what we do in basin. So that's the point to make there. In the Chalk, we brought on those three wells. Today, we don't have anything planned in terms of drilling from a working interest perspective. In the Chalk, there may be some non-op wells we participate in, where we've got some non-op interest there that others are drilling. But nothing planned in our budget this year for Chalk drilling.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open.
Arun Jayaram: Hey, good morning. John, the more recent activities in Suriname have been focused on appraisal activity with, I guess, two rigs now on location at Krabdagu. What are you and the partners' plans in terms of incremental exploration post the evaluation results of Krabdagu with the two rigs.
John Christmann: There will be another exploration well drilled, Arun, and we're still working on that location between us. There are several prospects. Both teams are spending time, high grading. I mean, if you go back and look at both Awari and Bonboni and Block 58, we have working petroleum system, hydrocarbon systems out there. The main targets in both cases failed because of breach of seal. And so I'd say teams are spending time, but there is a lot more prospectivity to the outboard side, all the way back into the – where we've had great success. So working through that with our partners. And as we get in a position to drill more wells, we'll talk about those as they come onto the rig lines.
Arun Jayaram: Got it. And just maybe one follow-up in the Permian. John, as I think about your 2022 program in the broader Permian including in 4Q – the company didn't place as many wells on the sales as we have thought in terms of our modeling, looking at 4Q, I think you placed one or so wells to sales – what drove that in 2022? Were you building some DUCs and just thoughts on – will that shift a little bit as we think about 2023 because you have a pretty robust production growth outlook from the…
John Christmann: No, Arun, it's a great question. I mean it's really more just the lumpiness of a program. We're drilling longer laterals – and you've got two rigs in the Midland Basin. And so a lot of it is just the timing of the pads, completing the pads and then working through the completion timing. So with only two rigs, you're going to see lumpiness from us, whereas if we were running a lot more rigs and that lumpiness kind of starts to work itself out and normalize. So it's really just a function of timing on those with longer laterals.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor Pickering. Your line is open.
Jeoffrey Lambujon: Hey, good morning everyone. Appreciate you all taking my questions.
John Christmann: You bet, Jeff.
Jeoffrey Lambujon: Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a couple of here follow-ups on Egypt. Obviously, some solid execution there, especially relative to earlier in 2022, as you highlighted, that's showing up and production results as we all saw. So as you think about the 2023 guide. I was hoping you could speak to how you're thinking about the level of conservatism or risking that might be baked in there as you think about the oil growth exit to exit. And what kind of running room you might see from here on operations and efficiencies as you move through the year? And we're focusing on in terms of tracking execution from beyond the 2023 program?
John Christmann: Well, I mean, Jeff, a question. We obviously try to guide to what we believe are numbers with high confidence that we can hit, and we spend a lot of time on that. I do believe there are things at times that – the nice thing about Egypt is there is ability to – with success to bring other things on and get other wells drilled and high grade that schedule as you're moving through the year. But I think we've given a very realistic and good guides for 2023. And I think there's good confidence from the team. I know I sure asked that question and the response I get the response that I'm comfortable to relay.
Jeoffrey Lambujon: Okay. Great. And then I guess just on operations and efficiencies, again, obviously improved quite a bit as you move to 2022. Just want to get a sense for what you're focusing on from that perspective and what kind of running room you might see for improvements from here?
John Christmann: Yes. It's all about operational excellence and continuing to try to improve and learn from things as you go. In Egypt, we're drilling in some new areas with the seismic and some of the exploration that we're doing there. And so within those areas, we should see improvement as we drill more wells and things – areas you've drilled before. So you're seeing some of that. And the big thing is across the entire organization, across the asset teams across the functions, everybody is really trying to take all that they integrate it and get better. I mean it's about continuous improvement and execution excellence. And you saw great progress on the safety front. We're going to continue that and continue to focus on the operations. Paying attention to details.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Mr. John Christmann for closing remarks.
John Christmann: Yes. Thank you. And before closing today's call, I want to leave you with the following thoughts. First, I want to recognize our entire team for their hard work and dedication to safety, operational excellence and environmental stewardship. APA remains committed to financial and operational discipline. We are focused on leveraging the portfolio to invest in the highest return projects. While activity cadence will impact our first quarter, we are confident in our growth outlook for 2023. Lastly, in Suriname, the JV has accelerated appraisal at Krabdagu, and we look forward to keeping you informed of our progress. I will turn the call back to the operator.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-03 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to APA Corporation's Third Quarter 202 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce Vice President of Investor Relations, Gary Clark.
Gary Clark: Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's Third Quarter 2022 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call.  We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development, Tracey Henderson, Senior Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations.  Our prepared remarks will be less than 15 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our third quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com.  Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.  Consistent with the previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels.  I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call today, I will review highlights from the third quarter, provide commentary on our fourth quarter outlook and conclude with an early look at our 2023 plan.  APA continues to enjoy a robust free cash flow profile provided by our unhedged exposure to a globally diversified product price mix. With activity in Egypt and the Permian Basin now at levels capable of driving sustainable corporate production growth, our free cash flow is also expected to grow, assuming flat year-over-year oil and gas prices.  Turning to the third quarter results. We have had several key highlights. Global production was in line with our guidance range as outperformance in the U.S. offset unplanned facility downtime in the North Sea.  Permian Basin assets were strong contributors across the board from the core Midland Basin development program to the newly acquired properties in the Texas Delaware. In Egypt, drilling and recompletion programs are progressing closer to our original plans for the year. New well connections exceeded our revised third quarter guidance and production momentum is picking up into the fourth quarter.  The challenges associated with the activity ramp are not totally behind us, but we are making good progress. The North Sea after returning to production from seasonal turnarounds incurred an unusually high amount of unplanned downtime in August and September. Most of these issues have been mitigated and volumes have returned to a more normalized level as reflected in our forward guidance.  During the third quarter, we generated more than $600 million of free cash flow, purchased nearly 10 million shares of APA common stock at an average price of $33.85 per share and announced a doubling of our annual dividend rate.  In Suriname, we advanced our exploration and appraisal program with the first oil discovery on Block 53 at Baja and a successful flow test of the CrabDagu discovery well in Block 58.  And on the ESG front, I am very pleased to announce that we have successfully delivered on our 2022 goal to reduce flaring in Egypt. Today, new projects are reducing routine upstream flaring by 40%, enabling us to compress the gas into sales lines and deliver to Egyptian consumers for cleaner burning affordable fuel.  More information on our third quarter results can be found in the operational supplement posted on our website.  Turning now to our fourth quarter outlook. Capital investment is projected to be around $450 million, and our full year guidance of $1.725 billion remains unchanged. We expect adjusted production will increase by around 5% from the third quarter, driven primarily by an increase in new well connections and recompletion activity in Egypt and a rebound from planned and unplanned platform maintenance downtime in the North Sea.  Given the age of the North Sea facilities, we expect facility run times will generally be lower and more variable than in the past. As a result, we are now providing a production guidance range to accommodate a broader spectrum of potential future outcomes. In Suriname on Block 58, we are currently participating in the drilling of 2 wells, a second appraisal well at Sapakara South and an exploration well at Aware.  Results will be provided as they become available. Despite a few challenges during 2022 we will exit the year in a strong position financially and operationally. We are on track to generate around $2.7 billion in free cash flow for the year. Consistent with our 60% capital returns program, we anticipate returning at least $1.6 billion of this in share buybacks and dividends.  While there is more to do, we have significantly strengthened our balance sheet, reducing net debt by more than $1.4 billion through the end of the third quarter and production volumes are now trending sustainably higher in the U.S. and Egypt.  As we plan for 2023, our objectives remain the same. We will maintain capital discipline, target moderate production growth, work tirelessly to mitigate rising costs and continue to deliver meaningful emissions intensity reductions.  Our capital budget next year will be around $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion. This assumes 5 rigs in the Permian Basin and up to 17 rigs in Egypt, while activity in the North Sea and Suriname is projected to remain consistent with 2022 levels.  Similar to our approach in 2022, this early view incorporates what we believe is an appropriate view of inflationary impacts on the capital program. The majority of the expected inflation is associated with U.S. rig and frac costs as contracts are renewed at the higher current rates.  Inflationary pressures in our international portfolio should be more muted. Despite the planned increase in capital investment in a like-for-like price environment, we estimate APA's free cash flow will grow in 2023. Note, this excludes any uplift from our Cheniere gas supply contract commencing in the second half of the year.  Steve will provide more details on this contract, which gives us access to premium natural gas price points in Europe and Asia. Following 3 years of production decline since the beginning of the COVID pandemic, we look forward to returning to growth in 2023.  At the corporate level, we are targeting mid-single-digit year-over-year growth, driven primarily by higher oil production across all assets. In the third quarter, our Permian Basin results were particularly strong due to a variety of factors, including good underlying base production and new well performance.  The timing and number of new completions and relatively minimal maintenance, midstream and weather-related downtime. As we look into the fourth quarter of 2022, in the first quarter of 2023, we expect Permian production will be flat to down as we experienced a lull in new well connections and reflect the potential for winter weather-related downtime in our outlook. Planning for next year continues and we will have much more detail to provide with our fourth quarter results in February.  In closing, we have a constructive outlook on the long-term demand for natural gas and oil. This hasn't changed despite the potential near-term demand impacts of a recession and the ongoing debate over the pace of global decarbonization trends.  We continue to plan our business using relatively conservative commodity price scenarios, allocate capital to our highest return projects and target long-term single-digit sustainable production growth. APA will continue to return 60% of free cash flow to shareholders through buybacks and dividends while also continuing to strengthen the balance sheet.  Lastly, we remain committed to reducing emissions within our operational footprint, and we will be introducing specific CO2 equivalent emissions intensity goals around this objective in the near future.  And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney.
Stephen Riney: Thank you, John. For the third quarter of 2022, APA Corporation reported consolidated net income of $422 million or $1.28 per diluted common share. Our quarterly results include items that are outside of APA's core earnings. The most significant of these was a $275 million charge for the impact of the U.K. energy profits levy. This was partially offset by a $93 million release of tax valuation allowance due to the use of tax loss carryforwards during the quarter.  Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the third quarter was $651 million or $1.97 per diluted common share. Most of our financial results in the third quarter were in line or better than guidance. For the quarter, we reported a net gain of $12 million on the sale of oil and gas purchased for resale.  This was better than the guidance we provided in August of a $10 million loss. As a reminder, we sell our gas in basin at Waha Hub or El Paso Permian based pricing. Our marketing organization fulfills obligations on various commercial agreements, including our long-haul transport contracts using purchased product.  The reported gain or loss on the sale of oil and gas purchased for resale is a result of this latter activity. In the fourth quarter, based on recent strip pricing, we expect this activity to result in a net gain of approximately $70 million.  GPT expense, which is costs incurred for gathering, processing and transmission was above guidance for the third quarter. This has been a trend for much of 2022 and is primarily a result of the higher natural gas prices in the U.S. GPT expense increases with gas price because some of our gas processing contracts are based on the percentage of proceeds and accounting for such contracts results in costs going up and down with movements in gas price.  G&A of $69 million was considerably below our guidance. As with prior quarters, this was primarily the result of the required quarterly mark-to-market of our cash settled stock-based compensation plans. Underlying G&A for the quarter was around $90 million, a little lower than average. Turning to the balance sheet. You will notice that our total debt increased $244 million to $5.5 billion in the third quarter, as we utilize the revolver to partially fund the closing of the Texas Delaware Basin acquisition at the end of July.  As we've discussed on prior calls, the revolving credit facility is an asset that can be utilized when attractive opportunities arise. We've demonstrated this over the past 2 years using the revolver to fund timely debt tenders, share repurchases and asset acquisitions. Over time, we will look to pay down the revolver with available free cash flow that is not committed under the capital return framework. A few other things before we turn to Q&A. Please refer to our financial and operational supplement, which includes additional information related to our third quarter results as well as our updated guidance for the fourth quarter of 2022. This can be found on our website.  2022 will be a very strong year for free cash flow at APA. As John mentioned previously, at comparable prices, we expect to see increasing free cash flow in 2023. This excludes any financial benefit from our Cheniere gas supply contract.  At recent strip pricing, the anticipated benefit to 2023 would be around $570 million, assuming the latest possible start date of August 1, which is a slightly later date than we have spoken of previously.  One final note on U.S. income taxes. At this time, barring any contrary guidance that may be issued by tax authorities we do not expect to be subject to the new 15% corporate alternative minimum tax until 2024. Thus, we currently anticipate no U.S. cash income taxes for 2023, as accumulated NOLs should more than offset projected taxable income.  As always, please follow up with Gary and his team with any questions or if you need any other help related to our updated guidance. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Doug Leggate: I got one on Suriname to kick us off, and then I'll go to 1 of the financial questions, if that's okay. John, I realize that you've got a couple of wells drilling right now. And -- but I'm also aware that Hess and Shell, I guess, Shell, as you operator had a discovery that looks on trend, if I'm not mistaken, with your prospect.  So I'm wondering if you can characterize a your expectations or what the current status is? And whether I'm reading that right, that there might be some read-through from confirmation of a working hydrocarbon system. And I guess, Hess has not really -- you haven't any details as to whether that was a success or not, but it looks like they are reviewing it as we speak.
John Christmann: No. Doug, the well we're drilling in the kind of the northwest portion of our block is a You will remember Bonboni, it's 25 kilometers west of Bonboni, where we found an active or working hydrocarbon system. It appears that they have a working hydrocarbon system north of us as well. So I think that's all good news. The big thing here will be trap. And -- but Tracy Henderson is here, and I'll let Tracy provide a little bit more color.
Tracey Henderson: Doug, I think your comments are really spot on. We are sort of updip in trend from the well we know as much as you do in terms of what's been in the public domain, but it sounds like a positive result at least with respect to the petroleum system. So what this does do, as John mentioned, we had seen Bonboni in the upper -- or oil in the upper part of Bonboni previously. So what this does is basically push the mature proven kitchen further north into Block 42, so well north of our Block 58 Northern boundary, which is good news for the petroleum system.  And I would say it also increases the fetch area in the Block 58 or the Block 58 Northern prospects. I would counter that though with saying with these deepwater fans all along sort of that entire margin, the biggest critical risk factor is trap. So we will still need to be very focused on what our trapping geometries are, but from a petroleum system standpoint, if you have a working trap, this is good and it increases your confidence that you can charge them.
Doug Leggate: I hate to do a kind of Part 1b, but just while we're on the topic of Suriname, do you have any color on Sapakara South at this point as it relates to whether that can help inform an FID in 2023?
John Christmann: Well, a couple of things I have to say, Doug, on Sapakara South. Number one, it's strongly supported from a seismic perspective, and it's an updip test of Sapakara South.  Our operations are ongoing. And I'll say it could be a very material add to that area. So we're very excited about it in terms of FID and so forth. We've got the appraisal at Sapakara South, which is ongoing. We also got appraisal at Krabdagu, which will follow sometime early next year. So we're excited about that, and we'll just have to get with you when we're ready.
Doug Leggate: My follow-up is for Steve. And I guess, Steve, I'm going to try and layer in a couple of things to this, I guess. But obviously, Cheniere doesn't want to start this contract as soon as -- as early as you would like it to start. I think it was pretty clear given LNG prices.  But I guess what I'm really trying to get to is your comments about free cash flow. You said, if I'm not mistaken, that the free cash flow -- the cash flow would be higher next year on a similar price deck, excluding Cheniere, if I heard that correct.  But you've also flipped this Waha trading contract or gathering contract to a kind of almost a $300 million run rate on revenues. So when you wrap all that together, it looks to us that the free cash flow could be up even at a substantially lower commodity deck. So can you help me understand if I'm reading that correctly?
Stephen Riney: Yes, Doug, I think we're just going to have to be -- probably be patient to finish the planning process for '23 and to -- we'll get to that in February, and we'll give all the details on that. But as John indicated, if we -- if we have -- if we end up with a capital program that's kind of similar to where we've been running for the last 2 years -- or 2 years, 2 quarters, which would be the $2 billion to $2.1 billion.  If we allocate that similarly to the way we've been allocating and delivering activity for those last 2 quarters, if we end up in a price environment similar to 2022, then we will be up on free cash flow for next year. There have been some things that have changed a bit since the last time we talked about '23, which was in February, we've got a little bit more activity that's leading to that increase in capital spending because we do have an extra rig in the Permian.  We've got a couple of extra rigs going into '23 in Egypt. There is -- there are some new taxes, in particular, the energy profits levy in the U.K., and there's talk now about possibly increasing the rate on that, that we did say we don't believe we're going to be subject to the U.S. alternative minimum tax in 2023, and that would certainly be good if we can defer that until 2024.  So there are -- and we've talked about the North Sea, perhaps being a little less predictable in terms of production volume. So having a wider range of possibilities in -- and we know that Egypt has gotten off to a little slower start in '22 than we had hoped for, and therefore, that will carry over a bit into 2023.  So we've tried to be really transparent about where we are going into 2023 relative to the last time we talked about it in February. But we think we've got very good momentum. We're fixing some of the issues that we had in the second quarter certainly looks better in third quarter results and going into fourth quarter better.  And I think we'll go into 2023 better. So a long-winded way of saying, let's wait until February for the details on the capital program and the capital allocation and what that means for production volume. But we feel very good. We feel like the plan that we laid out last February is still very much intact with the transparency of the few things that have changed since then.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.
John Freeman: Just a follow-up on the last line of question. I definitely appreciate the early look on 2023, understanding that there's still some moving parts. But if I just wanted to kind of tap on to what you're saying, Steve, where if you're running kind of in aggregate in the U.S. in Egypt, it looks like on a year-over-year basis, maybe an incremental 4.5 rigs versus what you did this year. Is there a way to sort of parse out of the $2 billion to $2.1 billion CapEx number? How much of that kind of year-over-year increase is kind of activity driven versus cost inflation?
Stephen Riney: Yes, I'd say that -- and John might have some comments on this as well. But I'd say look at the last 2 quarters, where we've -- especially fourth quarter, we're going to be running basically at what we're planning for, for 2023 preliminarily. Most of that was the same in the third quarter.  We did have a bit of time where we didn't have the Ocean Patriot in the North Sea in the third quarter. But on the last 2 quarters, we've been running just a little under or this last quarter and next quarter, we're running a little under $500 million a quarter, and that would give you a $2 billion on an annualized spend rate.  And that's -- so that's a preliminary view with maybe a little bit of inflation built into that go into possibly $2.1 billion. And that's just -- that's the preliminary view. We are still early days on the planning process, and I'd just caveat that with that could change. So let's wait and see in February. But I'd characterize it broadly as the bulk of the change in capital spending is because of the change in activity.
John Freeman: Okay. Great. And then my follow-up question on Egypt. You all did a really good job of playing catch up, getting the completion cadence in the second half of the year back up pretty meaningfully after the growing pains in the second quarter.  But John, you mentioned that it's not totally behind us in terms of some of the -- what you are going through in Egypt. Can you just sort of maybe give a little bit more color to what you're speaking to because at least on a completion cadence, it looks really good, where you all going to exit the year at in Egypt?
John Christmann: Yes. We're in pretty darn good shape, but we've worked hard to get here in a pretty short time period. And a lot of it is just addressing manpower issues and training -- and so we're in pretty good shape, John.  And I think we're close to where we wanted to be, but you're still working through some things there, but we're in pretty good shape.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist.
Neal Dingmann: First question, a little bit on what Freeman was just asking. John, my first question is on production growth. Specifically, you all, I think, characterized '23 as potentially seen, I think, what you deem this kind of moderate growth.  But to me, looking at your '23 domestic and Egyptian activity plans, it seems like production could be even maybe a bit better than moderate? I know you don't have '23 guide yet, but I guess what I'm wondering is how you view sort of next year's contributions incrementally when you think about Egypt versus domestically given to me all the domestic opportunities, including the new play there?
John Christmann: Yes, I would just say, and Steve went into pretty good detail on an update of the early look on a 3-year plan, and it's very dynamic, and we're working that and we'll come back in February.  But in general, you're still looking at mid-single digits on a BOE basis at the corporate level is what we're looking at. And that's going to be driven by oil in Egypt. We should have cleaner run next year in the North Sea, although we're going to have a range -- and then obviously, we've had really good performance in the U.S., specifically in the Permian.
Neal Dingmann: Okay. Great detail. John. And then secondly, just on shareholder return, I'm just wondering, would you all say you're still leaning in the stock buybacks, I guess what I'm trying to get a sense of that 1.6 buyback plan, what remains year-to-date.
John Christmann: I would just say, I'll underscore, we're committed to the returns framework, and we will deliver a minimum of the 60%.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein.
Robert Brackett: I had a question on the Cheniere gas supply contract. You mentioned the scale of a $570 million opportunity. Could you break that down for us in terms of volume implied and maybe the price differential between Henry Hub and whether you think about TTF or JKM?
Stephen Riney: Yes, Bob, that -- so the contract is $140 million a day and the $570 million, I won't recall exactly what day, but it's based on strip pricing for -- and we assumed an 80% TTF, 20% JKM mix, which we have the right to elect and that was versus the same period strip for Houston Ship Channel. And then it has all of the deducts that we get from that contract for liquefaction for shipping, for shrinkage and for regas and things like that.
Robert Brackett: Very clear. And that's sort of starting up in September through the -- that $140 million a day is 4 months or 5?
Stephen Riney: It would be five months. The -- by contract, the latest that contract can start is August 1. It could start earlier. I'm not holding my breath.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays.
Jeanine Wai: Maybe we just go to the North Sea here. You mentioned in your prepared remarks, lower and more variable run times, just kind of given the age of the asset. Now we potentially have some higher EPL kind of overhanging here. The current 2023 outlook as it stands today, as you said, the North Sea activity should be consistent with 2022. But we're just wondering what the potential range of outcomes could be there, whether it's related to changes in the regulatory environment or by your choice. And we know it doesn't quite work like sale, but what kind of base decline is the North Sea on.
David Pursell: Yes, Jeanine, this is Dave Pursell. I don't have the numbers in of me. But think about the 2 different assets. We have 40s, which is a mature waterflood, that's going to be on a the base decline there is going to be on a high single-digit annual decline. These are high water cut low decline wells -- barrels a bit different.  There's water -- there's pressure maintenance through water injection in many of those assets, but the -- you'll see more conventional type declines in barrel. So they'll be higher than 40s. And so we can circle back and get to the blended number. But it's going to be somewhere in the mid- to high teens just based on memory, but we can -- we'll tighten that up.
Jeanine Wai: Okay. Great. And then maybe turning to the revolver. I think, Steve, you said you consider it to be an asset to utilize and there's attractive opportunities, you'll look to pay it down over time. I guess our question is how much is too much on the revolver? And how does this really factor into your appetite for future bolt-ons?
Stephen Riney: Yes. And I know our controller won't like me calling that an asset, but we view it as such in the nonaccounting sense and it's for that very reason. We can -- we used it for the bolt-on acquisition in July in the Delaware Basin. We use it for debt tenders. We've used it for share buybacks.  In particular, we use it during periods where we have a period where we have no material nonpublic information and we can use it for open market repurchases of shares in periods where we can be a little more selective at the pace at which we buy back shares during those periods of time.  So the revolver comes in very handy at those times. We -- especially with the price environment that we're in, we're pretty comfortable with the revolver where we've got it now and where it's been for most of the year.  But we do need to get that paid down and preserve it longer term for that optionality around potential bolt-on acquisitions if we find the good opportunities.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles Meade: John, I'm hoping to get you to elaborate a little bit more your thinking on supercar south to and what kind of piece of the puzzle this might be? I mean my understanding is you could drill appraisal wells in many locations, but the location you do because you're hoping it will answer some questions for you and move you towards sanctioning projects.  So can you talk about what the goals were with this location. I think you mentioned it's up dip and how that could play into the moving the project forward in '23?
John Christmann: Yes. The thing I would say, if you look at Sapakara South, it was a very, very high-quality discovery. You had 30 meters of pay -- actually 32 meters full to base. Low GOR, around 1,100 and you had really, really high perm 1.3 to 1.5 Darcy rock.  At the time of that, we announced a connected volume, which we later updated to more than 400 million barrels. So Sapakara South is really world-class rock. We also said at the time that we believe there was additional resource there that needed to be appraised. And that's exactly what this well is doing. It's moved up dip, and we are appraising and we've got really, really good seismic support. We think the seismic is working. And it could add materially to that Sapakara South discovery.
Charles Meade: Okay. Got it. Well, it would be interesting to catch up whenever you guys have the information to share there. And second question, I think this is perhaps for Steve, but maybe for you, John, I think Neal was going at this a little bit earlier.  Putting the pieces in your press release, you guys say that you're going to return at least $1.6 billion of cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. And then you guys had a helpful slide in your presentation where you say you're at kind of 1.1 right now, and you've got another 130. Actually, you're at 1 right now, and you've got maybe another 130 of dividends that are going to come in 4Q. So that -- if I'm doing the math right, that's about $450 million for the last -- or actually maybe you did $80 million in But it's on the order of $400 million for November and December. And that's a big chunk. Are you guys going to be able to -- are you guys going to have to enter into some kind of a tender to get those shares in? Or is this something you think you can do just participating in the regular daily bid?
Stephen Riney: Yes. Charles, let me -- I'll just run quickly through the similar math that you were going through. We do expect now at recent strip prices that free cash flow this year will be $2.7 billion, as John said. So that would imply a minimum committed returns of $1.6 billion.  Year-to-date, we've done $127 million of dividends. We've bought back 26 million shares at $34. So that's $884 million of buyback. And as you said, that's just over $1 billion so far this year. Since inception by the way, that's 15% of the company that we bought back at a little over $31 a share.  So at $2.7 billion of free cash flow that would imply for the fourth quarter total returns of $600 million. The dividends will be about $80 million. And so that implies buybacks of $520 million and we've done right around $80 million of that in October.  So your math was pretty darn close that with all of that, if you landed right on 60% would be about $440 million of additional share buybacks. Historically, we've delivered those buybacks through 10b5-1 programs and through OMRs. As I said, we use OMRs when we don't have material nonpublic information, we are drilling 2 wells in Suriname.  So we do understand that situation and the risk associated with that as John said, we're committed to that program. So you should assume that we have plans in place to make sure that, that will be delivered and -- because it will be delivered by the end of December.
Charles Meade: Got it. So I appreciate you corrected my math, Steve, and it's kind of a wait and see, but you guys have planned to get there, if I'm understanding it correctly. .
Stephen Riney: That's correct. We will get to you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng: Two questions, please. The first 1 is a little bit of the John, when you're talking about mid-single -- mid-single-digit oil production growth for next year. Is it based on the fourth quarter or based on full year 2022 level? Because if it is based on full year 2022 level, that suggests that your next year oil production may be lower than the fourth quarter level.  And with the increased activities -- and is there any reason why that the average production will be lower on the oil growth for next year than the fourth quarter level? That's the first question.  And second 1 is very simple. On the Permian, you're saying you're going to run 5 rigs, but do you include anything in the Alpine High. And then what's your view given the current commodity prices between the gas well and oil only weight as well.
John Christmann: So number one, it's -- '23 is a work in progress. So we're working on that. We said we'd come back in February. But in general, we said BOEs will be up mid-single digit. It's going to be driven by oil.  And it is year-over-year is -- but we'll come back with that in detail. That's really pretty much the shape of the 3-year plan that we put out last February. When we look at the Permian, 5 rigs, yes, today, we've got 2 in the Midland Basin, 3 in the Delaware. There will be activity at Alpine High. And we do like the mix, and we think those wells compete very well today with where the gas price deck is and the oil price deck.
Paul Cheng: John, should we assume you're going to have at least 1 rig at Apline High or is that just not necessarily it may be...
John Christmann: I would say today, today, just assume there's likely 3 in the Delaware and Alpine High will be part of that program.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with MKM Partners.
Leo Mariani: I was hoping to jump back to the North Sea here real quick. Just kind of looking at the production over the last couple of years, certainly, you guys have been hit with a lot of downtime there.  You're forecasting higher production here in the fourth quarter. Just wanted to get a sense if there's like some things you're doing different operationally where you're kind of feeling more comfortable that you're going to be able to kind of deliver maybe some higher rates here going forward in the North Sea.
John Christmann: I'd just say a lot of it's -- we're coming out of our maintenance turnaround season. And we've had to play catch up in '22 for '20 and '21. The Covid years hit pretty hard there and we were limited on what we could do on the tars.  And you've just got aging infrastructure. And when things go down, it takes a little longer to get things back up. But I think we've got a lot of that behind us. And we will be guiding with wider ranges in the future. But right now, we've got good momentum and things are running fairly smooth.
Leo Mariani: Okay. And just jumping over to Egypt here. Just looking at your kind of gross oil volumes, look like those were down a little bit here in 3Q versus 2Q.  Can you just give us some indications as we get into kind of 4Q and early next year? Do you think 3Q is the low point on those gross oil volumes, and we start to have some nice growth into kind of the end of the year. And then do you see kind of what type of growth do you see in Egypt next year? Do you see that driving a lot of the overall production growth of the company?
John Christmann: Yes. I think some of that is just timing of the well connections we had this quarter, and we've got good momentum really across the whole portfolio going into the fourth quarter, we're off to a good start and we had some wells that have come on and things. So we do think Egypt is going to be 1 of the big drivers in '23 and beyond.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum with Cowen.
David Deckelbaum: Just wanted to ask if I could. Following up quickly just on North Sea. John, I think your comments were just on the aging infrastructure. Is there sort of a more of an outsized maintenance CapEx spend that goes into North Sea and '23?  Is there an imminent need to upgrade facilities? And how does that sort of square with where production would be in the fourth quarter. Are we back to a more sustained level ex downtime heading into next year?
John Christmann: I don't think it's any outsized. I think we really played catch-up in '22 and '23. There are always decisions that you make as you get into later years like at 40s on equipment, and those are decisions we make routinely going forward. But those are all things you're constantly weighing the pros and cons of as you're looking at operating facilities as they get later in their life, but don't anticipate anything significantly outsized from normal and we should be in a period today with most of that behind us where things are going to run a little smoother.
David Deckelbaum: Appreciate that. And maybe if I could just ask for a little bit more color on the Cheniere contract. I think you all had marked today based on strip pricing. Can you give us a sense on just how those netbacks work?  Are the costs that are coming out of those LNG contracts on a fixed or variable basis. And what's a good ballpark to apply on sort of an MMBtu basis for costs relative to where the headline TTF price might be?
Stephen Riney: Yes. Unfortunately, we -- it's difficult to give a kind of a generic approach to figuring it out because some of the costs like shrinkage and fuel and things like that will come out effectively at it's a loss of volume. So it comes out at the TTF and JKM price, and some of them are contractual dollar amount costs that do have some provision for inflation over time.  So a good example of that would be the liquefaction fee. So it's not that easy to give a kind of a generic rule of how it will work through different prices of LNG or Houston Ship Channel for that matter. So we -- that's why we just give it as a as a margin over Houston Ship Channel. Because I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks that we actually sell all of our product that we produce in basin in the Permian. And we enter into pipeline contracts and things like that, primarily as a participant in the industry to keep less liquid markers like Waha Hub more attached to the bigger, more liquid markets.  And then we have a marketing organization that manages those contractual obligations. And -- we -- for that reason, we look at the Cheniere contract as a margin over purchased product because we will purchase product on the Gulf Coast and deliver that to Cheniere.  The pricing that we get is that netback calculation and they buy the product, they take title to it at their plant in let. So we don't have any title to product as it goes through their plant or the liquefied product as it comes out. We don't manage shipping or anything like that. We don't do the selling. They do all of that for us.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Doug Leggate: I'm sorry guys for lining up again. But John, I guess, I'm listening to all the questions about the North Sea. I'm listening to the higher windfall tax risk, the less predictability, the life expectancy the field, et cetera, et cetera.  And I guess the obvious question to me seems to be -- is this a core asset for Apache? Is there a point at which -- whether it be you get another core area and Suriname perhaps at some point does the North Sea become surplus to requirements, basically, is it for sale?
John Christmann: Yes. I mean, the thing I would say, Doug, is that today, North Sea is a core asset for us. Obviously, you've had some factors out there today that impact the ability to invest future and you have to continually weigh in that. We benefit from the Brent pricing and the high netbacks and the free cash flow.  But we also have a portfolio that is dynamic. And so you're always looking to expand your ability to invest in other assets. And as things change, sometimes out of your control, it shrinks some of that. So -- but today, it is core but it's something we're always taking into account as we're laying our future plans.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions. So with that, I'll hand the call back over to President and CEO, John Christmann, for any closing remarks.
John Christmann: Thank you for joining us on our call today. We started the fourth quarter with strong momentum across our global operations, which will carry into 2023.  In Suriname, we're drilling an appraisal well at Sapakara South and an exploration well at Aware. We will share results when they are available. We remain on track to deliver on our capital returns framework. We will deliver at least 60% of 2022 free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks.  Our teams continue to work on our plans for the 2023 program and longer, and we look forward to providing more details to you in February. Operator, I will now turn the call back to you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the APA Corporation's Second Quarter 2021 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce Vice President of Investor Relations, Gary Clark.
Gary Clark: Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's Second Quarter 2022 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann; Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development; Tracey Henderson, Senior Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations.  Our prepared remarks will be around 20 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our second quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com.  Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.  Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call today, I will review our second quarter highlights and discuss key trends and performance in each of our core operational areas. Following that, I will provide some color on the 2022 guidance, which we updated last night in our earnings release and supplement.  Over the past few months, fears of economic recession, a new wave of coronavirus outbreaks and concern about potential demand destruction have created substantial volatility in commodity prices and the value of energy equities. However, the pullback in oil prices from the second quarter peak is healthy for both consumers and producers. We continue to have a positive outlook on the long-term fundamentals for natural gas and oil and view APA stock as a compelling value today. As I look at our second quarter results, I see several key highlights. APA generated record free cash flow of $814 million. We repurchased 7 million shares of APA common stock, followed by an additional $6.9 million of share repurchases in July. Gross oil production in Egypt increased by more than 7,000 barrels per day versus the prior quarter, which was our first material quarterly increase in Egypt oil production since 2018.  Our 40s field maintenance turnaround in the North Sea was executed safely and on budget. We advanced our program in Suriname with the successful flow test at Krabdagu, and we made excellent progress on upstream flaring reductions in Egypt and are on track to achieve our 40% reduction target by year-end. The second quarter was very good in many ways as our diversified unhedged portfolio benefited from rising oil and gas prices and high margins. However, we have encountered a few challenges. In Egypt, although we delivered strong oil production growth in the quarter, we are experiencing some delays and inefficiencies as we scale our active rig count from 5 to 15.  These include supply chain, equipment and infrastructure-related delays, longer-than-expected time to staff and reactivate cold-stacked rigs extended drill times, which are primarily a function of new rig and new crew inefficiencies and increased regional competition for experienced national employees. Well performance in Egypt has been in line with expectations. So these are mostly short-term above-ground challenges. We have identified and are swiftly taking appropriate actions that will bring us back up to pace. In the Austin Chalk, our delineation program has generated mixed results thus far, so we have chosen to pause most of our planned drilling and completion activities. I will talk more about the impact of these items on our second half guidance in a few minutes.  Turning now to some of the details of our second quarter results. Our largest spend categories Capital investment, operating costs and G&A were in line or less than expected for the quarter despite a challenging overall supply chain and cost environment. Total adjusted production of 305,000 BOE per day was down compared to the first quarter, primarily driven by our early March Permian Basin minerals divestiture and the impact of high oil prices on our Egypt PSC volumes, the timing of well connections across the portfolio and seasonal maintenance in the North Sea. We continue to expect our global adjusted production volumes will return to a growth path this year as our activity has now reached a level that we have not seen since 2019 prior to the COVID pandemic.  In the U.S., we continue to run a steady 2-rig program in the Southern Midland Basin and recently initiated drilling at Alpine High with a third rig. In Egypt, we averaged 12 rigs brought online a number of quality wells and achieved a high drilling success rate. Our strong oil production growth in the quarter was partially offset by a decline in lower margin natural gas production. In the North Sea, we are in the midst of summer turnaround season. We completed the maintenance turnaround at 40s on schedule and on budget and have brought that field back into production. At Beryl, we are wrapping up a platform turnaround and will return to production in the near future.  On Block 58 in Suriname, our partner, Total, is drilling the Dikkop exploration prospect which sits roughly 8 kilometers northwest of our Sapakara South discovery. On the adjacent Block 53, we are drilling the Baja exploration prospect with our partners, PETRONAS and CEPSA. On July 29, we closed on an acquisition of properties around our active development areas in the Texas Delaware Basin. This is an attractively valued tuck-in acquisition that comes with PDPs a number of wells in the drilling and completion process and a nice inventory of undrilled locations. It also brings a high-quality drilling rig and experienced crew to continue development in this very tight service environment. There are currently 2 rigs running on the new acreage. One will be released in the fourth quarter and we will retain the other as our fourth U.S. development rig. These assets compete well within our portfolio and integrate nicely into our Permian operations.  Turning now to our outlook for the second half of the year, which we included in our financial and operations supplement last night. Our CapEx program of $1.725 billion remains unchanged for the year. Steve will have some comments on a few minor changes in other P&L guidance items. In terms of adjusted production, our new full year guidance range for Egypt is 63,000 to 65,000 BOEs per day, which is down about 7% from prior expectations. More than half of this decrease is a result of fewer wells being drilled and completed due to the operational challenges I spoke of earlier, the remainder is attributable to the PSC impact of higher oil prices. In the U.S., we have a number of moving parts affecting our outlook for the remainder of the year. First, we have removed roughly 8,000 BOEs a day of Austin Chalk production from the second half of the year following the decision to defer most of our near-term drilling and completions. Second, we expect the Texas Delaware Basin acquisition properties will average 12,000 to 14,000 BOEs per day of production for the remaining 5 months of the year. We've also encountered some completion delays on Permian operated and nonoperated wells and recently divested a small package of Permian properties. The net effect of these items is a slight downward revision to our full year 2022 U.S. production guidance.  In the U.K. our near-term activity plan and full year 2022 production guidance remains unchanged. Later this month, the Garden 3 development well will commence production, which should generate a significant volume uplift in the fourth quarter. I will note that the new energy profits levy recently became effective in the U.K. This reduces our free cash flow outlook going forward. And while it won't affect our 2022 drilling program, we are evaluating the longer-term impacts of the tax on our planned investment in the U.K. But in general, new taxes are not effective incentives for increased investment. Steve will share more details about the tax impact in his remarks.  Turning now to an update on our ESG initiatives. APA's top priorities are reducing GHG emissions throughout our global operations and supporting our employees and the people in the communities where we operate. We have completed several projects across the portfolio, most notably in Egypt that enable us to compress and direct previously flared gas to sales, thereby increasing revenue and improving our emissions profile. This puts us well on our way to achieving our goal of reducing upstream routine flaring in Egypt by 40% by year-end. I'm very pleased with our progress on this and many other fronts, and there is much more to come. Also, in late July, we issued our 2022 sustainability report. I hope you will take a moment to review the report and learn more about our strategy and initiatives to provide affordable, reliable energy to the world while also delivering on rigorous near- and medium-term ESG goals.  In closing, APA remains committed to returning 60% of free cash flow through buybacks and dividends as well as strengthening our balance sheet, including paying down debt as it matures. At current strip prices, we expect to generate approximately $3 billion of free cash flow in 2022, of which at least $1.8 billion would be returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Through July, we have returned just under 50% of this amount.  And finally, I would like to extend a personal thank you to John Lowe, APA's Chairman, who recently announced his retirement after serving 9 years on the board. John has been a great friend and colleague. We have benefited greatly from his experience and insights, and we wish him all the best. Lamar McKay has been elected to serve as APA's new Board Chairman, and will formally take over for John in September. Lamar has a wealth of experience that I know will be a tremendous asset to the board room and my leadership team. We are all looking forward to working with him and welcome him into his new role.  And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney.
Stephen Riney: Thanks, John. For the second quarter of 2022, APA Corporation reported consolidated net income of $926 million or $2.71 per diluted common share. As is common, this quarter, our results include items that are outside of APA's core earnings. The most significant of these was $129 million related to the release of tax valuation allowance for the use of tax loss carryforwards to offset U.S. income tax expense. Excluding this and other such items, adjusted net income for the second quarter was $811 million or $2.37 per diluted common share. Our second quarter results underscore APA's robust free cash flow capacity. The $814 million we generated during the second quarter represents a 21% increase from the preceding quarter and more than double the same period in the prior year.  Cost inflation has become a popular topic in quarterly earnings calls and for good reason. Oil and gas firms are subject to the same inflationary pressures on labor, materials, fuel and services as every other industry. We embedded a substantial amount of cost pressure into the budget we laid out in February. And for the most part, costs have tracked close to that plan for the first 2 quarters. For the second half, we anticipate a bit more inflationary pressure in LOE than originally planned, especially in fuel costs. As a result, our full year guidance has moved up a bit higher. Second quarter G&A of $89 million was considerably lower than first quarter and was also below our guidance. As we have discussed before, we use cash settled stock-based incentive compensation plans that require a quarterly mark-to-market based on movements in our share price. This introduces some volatility in our quarterly reported G&A expense, which we generally do not attempt to include in our guidance. For example, APA's share price increase into the end of the first quarter resulted in higher reported G&A expense and the declining share price into the end of the second quarter resulted in the opposite. As a baseline, our underlying quarterly G&A expense runs around $100 million, and our full year guidance reflects this for the remaining 2 quarters of the year.  With the higher commodity prices, you will note that both sales and costs related to purchased oil and gas have increased substantially. As a reminder, where possible, we saw all of our production in basin and our marketing organization fulfills obligations on various commercial agreements such as long-haul transport contracts using purchased product. The net impact of these 2 lines will mostly track the basis differential, less transport costs on the GCX and PHP pipelines. Finally, exploration expense was higher during the quarter as we recorded $32 million in dry hole costs related to the Rasper exploration well in Block 53 offshore Suriname.  Turning now to the progress we've made during the quarter on the balance sheet. In the second quarter, we paid down $605 million on our revolving credit facility, which brought our balance down to $275 million on June 30. The -- last week, we drew on the revolver to fund the closing of our Delaware Basin acquisition. So that balance will rise again in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we will pay off the January 2023 bond maturity of $123 million at par. While we have made great progress strengthening the balance sheet over the last year, we have more to do. That said, it is nice to see the rating agencies recognizing the improvement.  Our long-term desire is to return to investment grade through a continued steady pace of debt reduction. Paying off bonds at their maturity combined with the occasional debt tender or open market repurchases. A couple of other things before we turn to Q&A. With respect to our full year 2022 guidance, there are a few minor changes. We increased our guidance for LOE and decreased guidance for G&A to reflect some of the impacts I spoke of previously. We have also updated our guidance for our latest view on the net impact from purchased oil and gas I mentioned earlier.  Our guidance for U.K. tax expense has increased to reflect $130 million incremental cost for the energy profits levy. We will pay this additional 2022 tax in 2 parts, approximately half during the fourth quarter of this year and the remainder in the first quarter of next year. As John noted previously, we are committed to our capital returns framework, which means material share buybacks will continue in the second half of 2022. Ideally, all of this would be delivered in the day-by-day open market repurchase program. However, there has been and will continue to be periods of time where the possession of material nonpublic information will preclude open market repurchase of our shares. During such times, we expect to utilize 10b5-1 programs to maintain a minimum underlying pace of buybacks. This was the case for much of the second quarter and we have established similar plans for the rest of the year. As always, please refer to our financial and operational supplement or follow up with Gary and his team with any questions or if you need any help related to our updated guidance. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Doug Leggate: John, I wonder if I could hit the 800-pound gorilla in the room, which is in March, you laid out a 3-year plan. And a couple of quarters into it, were $555 million higher in spending and your production guidance is lower. How should we think about Apache management's ability to risk that outlook? And what would you say about the outlook for 2023 at this point?
John Christmann: Doug, thanks for joining us this morning. First of all, we feel good about our 3-year plan. there's been, as we laid out a couple of challenges, and we take responsibility for those and hit them head on. I think the programs are running well. We've got some work to do in Egypt and we're on it. But if you look at -- we did need to take this year's guidance down a little bit. A lot of that is shifting of Egypt to the right, but the well performance has been good. I think it's premature to look at our '23 and '24, and it would be premature to adjust those forecasts right now. But in general, I think we feel good about the overall delivery over the 3-year period. And I will say we baked in a lot of inflation on the cost side, and we have not had -- we've been able to manage that side really well. So I think in general, it would be early to do anything with the '23 and '24 years.
Doug Leggate: So the '23 guidance today, including the contribution from the acquisition, is that still intact? You haven't -- obviously, you haven't spoken to 2023, but is it intact? Is it higher? Is it lower? Because Street doesn't seem to believe it based on where consensus expectations are?
John Christmann: No, I would just say today, we go through a process every year in the fall, we're looking at the next 3 years. We will review that. We'll come out with a new 3-year look in February. But in general, we still feel pretty good about the 3-year plan we laid out. And we did pick up some properties in the U.S. The program has been running strong and I think as you look out with the 4 rigs in the Permian, we're going to be just fine in the U.S. and Egypt, we're confident in the well results. We've just got to work through some efficiencies there. So in general, we feel good, Doug, about the 3-year plan and -- but it would be premature right now to do anything. We've got some work to do in the short term, but we're on it, so.
Doug Leggate: All right. On a different number, my follow-up is on gas. Should we now think of the Alpine High having a dedicated rig in which case, what does that mean for the production trajectory there? And as a related follow-up, perhaps, my understanding is you guys have been kind of rethinking the potential implications of your Cheniere contract as it relates to the free cash flow outlook. So I'm just wondering if you could touch on those 2 things, and I'll leave it there.
John Christmann: Yes. No, great question. We did not -- and I'll let Steve comment on the Cheniere contract after I make a few comments on the U.S. rigs. We'll have 4 rigs. We've had 4 rigs running in the U.S., we'll maintain those 4 rigs. You're going to have all 4 of those in the Permian now. 2 in the Southern Midland Basin. We'll have 2 in the Delaware. We've got a rig that we recently moved to Alpine High. Following up the results of our Willow well. We're excited to drill some pads there. So I think it will be positive. So you'll see 2 rigs in that area. The nice thing is having those 4 rigs in the Permian now, we can move them around it based on pads and timing and things. But we do envision 1 of those pretty much stand at Alpine High with the near-term. Steve, anything you want to comment on the Cheniere contract, which is not in those 3-year free cash flow and cash flow numbers?
Stephen Riney: Yes. Thanks, Doug. So a reminder, the Cheniere contract is a 15-year term contract, 140 million cubic feet a day. Cheniere does have the option to start that early with 90 days' notice. They can do that at any time at this point. But at a minimum, that contract will begin on July 1, 2023. And obviously, the pricing of LNG, JKM and TTF pricing has been amazingly volatile in the last year or so and for that matter here recently, so as Houston Ship Channel. But basically, the contract is structured as a -- where we capture the margin of a mixture of JKM and TTF LNG pricing over Houston Ship Channel. So effectively, people can think of it as we're going to buy at Houston Ship Channel. We're going to sell at a mix of JKM and TTF and we're going to pay some costs associated with tolling through Cheniere's plant, and then we'll pay the cost of transport and fuel loss and things like that. So there's some costs in between that. But that would tell you what the margin structure is on that contract. Again, it will begin July 1, 2023. We believe that is the date that it will begin for the reason I'm about to tell you. And that is that to purchase a Houston Ship Channel on a -- if you look at the forward strip, not even today's prices, which are even higher. But if you look at the forward strip for second half of '23, this contract, the uplift of JKM and TTF over Houston Ship Channel less the cost would generate about $750 million of free cash flow in the 6 months the second half of '23.
Doug Leggate: And that is not in the free cash flow numbers in the 3-year plan, Steve.
Stephen Riney: And that is not in any of the free cash flow numbers that we put forward in February. We just assumed all of that, that there was 0 margin over Houston Ship Channel for that contract.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.
John Freeman: First question I had a follow-up to Doug's first question. I realize you said it's kind of premature to look at '23, but we've had as we've gone through this earnings season, we've got more and more operators have talked about how they're having to secure next year as being 2023 kind of services and materials a lot sooner than they would have had to do in years past, just given the supply chain issues, cost inflation, et cetera. And I realize it's easier for some of the peers of yours that you have a single basin type portfolio versus a global diversified portfolio. But can you just sort of talk about like what you're able to do to try and secure something ahead of time, given you obviously have a lot more kind of unknown than many of your peers with the unknowns of what Suriname would look like next year. You got the windfall profit tax in the North Sea. Just I guess, sort of how you all manage in this environment, trying to secure things and kind of lock things in as far as advantage you can give kind of global portfolio you all have?
John Christmann: Well, John, great question. The thing I would say is we typically try to stay about a year ahead of our programs. And so we've been working on 20 -- started working on '23 as soon as the calendar turned. And we continue to do that, and they're starting to get pretty good visibility. The thing I would say about our guidance when we put it out our 3-year guidance, we bumped our capital quite a bit this year, as you'll recall, and took a pretty material increase. Most of that covered where we are today, and that's why you didn't see us have to bump our capital again this quarter. So I think we've got a pretty good handle on things. And I'll just say we built in quite a bit of inflation in '23 and '24 for next -- those next 2 years when we put out that outlook in February. So it's early to come back with hard numbers. for '23 and '24, but I think we've built in a lot of where we sit today on the inflation side.
John Freeman: And then a follow-up question for me on Suriname you've got the drill shift it will move back to -- or move to Block 58 after drilling the Baja prospect and then you end up having the 2 rigs in Block 58. Do you know following the Baja exploration prospect and Dikkop, where those wells would be located and I guess, more importantly, just from a financial modeling perspective, if those wells are likely to be -- continue to be exploration or appraisal some combination?
John Christmann: Yes. No, John, good question. What we typically do, and you can understand the those rig lines are dynamic. You've got some things that are dependent, some things that are independent in terms of wells and orders. And so because of that, we've typically waited until we're ready to move the rigs to tell you where they are going. Total has the value there drilling the Dikkop prospects right now. That is an exploration well. Clearly, we've got the Gerry De Souza in Block 53, where we're drilling an exploration well. That well will be moving back to Block 58 to Total. And I'll just say you're going to see a mix. There's appraisal to do at Sapakara South. There's also appraisal to do at Krabdagu, and there are also some other exploration wells. So when you see the rigs move, you're going to see probably a combination of exploration and appraisal with the 2 rigs. But I'm not in a position today to tell you which rig is going where with both of them right now.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays.
Jeanine Wai: Our first question, maybe it's for Steve here on the balance sheet and cash returns. You ended the quarter with $275 million on the revolver and that kind of stands out relative to peers. So we were just wondering, can you talk about how you're thinking about balancing maybe upside to the 60% minimum payout this year versus paying down debt versus being opportunistic either with hitting the buyback pretty hard on stock dislocations or bolt-ons like what you kind of announced now?
Stephen Riney: Yes. Janine, there's -- obviously, there's a lot of embedded questions in that. We're focused on both of those things. We've still got, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we've still got work to do on the balance sheet. And if you'll recall, we did the $1.1 billion debt tender earlier this year and put quite a bit of that on the revolver. So we use the revolver for things like that, and we use it quite a bit more than we have in the past. That's why you have the revolver, frankly. And we used it again this quarter for the Delaware Basin acquisition. And so -- again, that's the point of having a revolver. You use it from time to time to take some of those material type of steps. In this case, it was just a tuck-in acquisition. But we've got to be focused on continuing to pay down debt. We'd like to get the revolver balance as low as possible by the end of the year. There'll probably still be a bit left on it. But at the same time, we want to balance that with doing the share repurchases in a thoughtful manner. And again, as I said in my prepared remarks, we were in possession of material nonpublic information for quite a bit of the second quarter. So we couldn't be in the market using open market repurchases for shares. So we had to use the 10b5-1 programs. that we had set in place earlier in the year, and we let those run just to make sure that we had a continuing pace. Then when we announced the results of the Krabdagu flow test, we were able to reengage in open market repurchases and you saw what we did in the month of July. And so -- we're going to -- we're somewhat constrained a bit from time to time with material nonpublic information on what we can do on the share buybacks. But I think you're going to see us continue to focus on that and try to be as thoughtful as possible on that for the rest of this year while continuing to balance it with continue to strengthen the balance sheet. I don't know if all of that answered your question or not, hopefully.
Jeanine Wai: It did. It did. Maybe moving to Suriname for our second question. John, your partner recently indicated that you all hope to have an answer on maybe how to incorporate or monetize the associated gas by year-end. And I think 1 of the prior options that was discussed was maybe targeting initial development that was maybe more black oil focused and that could help fast-track the project, get things online. Are there any updated thoughts on this from your end? And I know there's nothing special about reaching FID at year-end during the first half of the year or anything like that. But any update here?
John Christmann: No, Jeanine, I think we're on track today, I would say, we envision a hub that would really set up between Sapakara South, Krabdagu, in that area kind of a centralized hub. We're still targeting predominantly a black oil, lower GOR development today. I do believe we have found a significant amount of gas in the block as well. And I think longer-term, we will want to look at gas alternatives and gas options because there's quite a bit of resource there. But today, our focus has been predominantly on a hub that would be a lower GOR FPSO.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.
Robert Brackett: A question on the Delaware Basin tuck-in. Could you give us some color? I'm thinking in terms of a larger acquisition where you might talk about the undrilled location, what does that inventory look like? What did you pay in terms of a free cash flow yield, those sorts of metrics that drove the deal and how they might inform future similar deals?
John Christmann: Doug, Bob, thanks. It's a nice tuck-in inside our Texas Delaware Basin. It has good inventory with long laterals and fits nicely. If you look strategically, we've been selling in the Permian I think we've sold over $1 billion. And so this is a nice ability to take and pick up some properties in an area that we know well where we've been running programs. It's got some production that comes with it. It's got a lot of wells that will be coming online and it's got some good inventory. Dave, anything you want to add?
David Pursell: Yes, I think it's just some follow-on. John talked about it. We've got some wells that have just come online. We have a handful that are coming online later this month. which will drive production through the end of this year. We also have 2 rigs finishing out a pad. It will add a substantial number of DUCs that we'll likely complete in the first quarter of '23. So there's a lot there. I think in the current -- I think when you think about the opportunity set here, -- we've got a number of intervals that this zone has that are low risk. We know the rock around existing infrastructure. So we think about high-quality, low-risk opportunities. Again, you get probably have several years of drilling just on those. And there's some upside potential. There's a number of zones that we're testing in our existing footprint, and we'll continue to test those and we'll likely test those zones here on our new acreage. And again, that's all upside that hopefully we'll be able to talk about as we go through 2023.
John Christmann: And the other thing I would add, Bob, is it brings a hot rig. I mean that's something that if you look a year ago, we were looking to add a rig in the Permian, and we started in the third quarter and really have showed up in April. And the nice thing about this is we've got a really high-quality rig. It's been performing well and a good crew.
David Pursell: Yes. And again, we're not going to talk about the development pace here, but if you can think about conceptually putting 1 rig on this for the next couple of years, this is free cash flow positive from day 1, and continues to generate free cash flow.
Robert Brackett: And I think that's intriguing the idea that an efficient rig ready to go in the Permian is actually an asset. My follow-up would be -- if I think about the Austin Chalk, and I might have misheard you, but was a 6-well program for 2022, and the revised production guidance was based on the mixed results was 4,500 barrels a day. Can you talk about sort of what the predrill expectations were and some of the learnings on why you didn't hit that number?
David Pursell: Yes. And I'm not -- we probably had more wells than that baked into the plan. But just to frame the Chalk to make sure everybody's familiar. We have a non-op and operated position in Washington County, which is West of College Station. What we've put the pause on was a 20,000-acre piece east of College Station on the Eastern edge of Brazos County. In that 20,000-acre piece, the first well we drilled was an outstanding result. We went into delineation mode as we were trying to delineate this 20,000-acre piece, and we ended up with a lot more variability in the results than we had anticipated. So the thought was, let's put pause on this. We've reduced the number of wells that we're going to put online this year. We're actually going to defer some completions as well while we study the results. And the point is this capital is better spent in the Permian. So we're going to pause it and we'll let you know what we come up with probably sometime in 2023.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist.
Neal Dingmann: My first question on EGF, I'm just wondering, John, if you -- maybe a bit more detail, just maybe talk about broad comments on what you're seeing on returns there. including maybe just an idea of how natural gas prices are trending the area as well.
John Christmann: Yes. Great question. First of all, our natural gas price is fixed, $2.65 per million per BTU. So gas price are fixed. As you know, we make our money through the profit oil in the split is the way the PSC is designed. So the other thing I would say is if you look at the overall market, here, we are increasing our rig count threefold at a time when the rig count in MENA has been growing at about a 20% clip. And so we found ourselves in a pretty unusual situation where there's been high demand for a lot of our trained Egyptian talent, national talent. And we're in the process at 1 point, I think we had 75 folks that we've had to replace effectively and backfill for. And so it's an interesting time, and it just gives you a little bit of a clue into the competition for national talent in the area today. And the good news is, as we're on it and addressing it. But what it's done is it's the safety statistics have been good, but it's manifested in just some delays in terms of getting wells drilled getting the rigs up and running and then getting wells connected. And so a lot of it, it's mainly just in the reactivation of the cold stacked rigs. And it's something we've done before. but it's just taking a little bit longer. And we'll get it ironed out, and we're working collectively with the folks on the ground there and this is something we'll sort out. You see it in our supplement. If you look at what we had planned to bring on in the second quarter, I think, 24 wells, we actually only got 11 on, but you see the pace with third quarter and fourth quarter picking back up. So it's kind of a short-term above-ground set back, but it's something we will recover from. In terms of the well performance has been good and kind of in line with performance. So no issues on the well performance side.
Neal Dingmann: Okay. Great details. And then just moving to Alpine High. I think you moved to rig or moving a rig there. Will that rig stay? And maybe if you could just comment on what you think the overall pace of activity might be later this year and into next year?
John Christmann: Yes. For now, we see it there. We've got some pads lined out to drill with 1 rig. It takes some time to drill those pads. So I think it will be late, late this year, early next year before you might see some production from that. But the plan is to leave that rig in there for now and for the most part, stay there. It might, after a pad or 2 jump over and pick up a well or 2 in the Delaware. But for the most part, it's going to stay at Alpine High.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with MKM Partners.
Leo Mariani: Just wanted to ask a little bit about the U.S. growth trajectory. I think previously, I think you guys had expected the oil volumes to kind of start to grow by the fourth quarter on an organic basis. I realized you made an acquisition, but you clearly took some volumes out of the Chalk. Just any updated thoughts when you resume organic oil growth again in the U.S. Is that still this year? Or is that maybe sliding into next year?
John Christmann: No. I think we'll get back on track pretty quick. We did pull out the Chalk, but that is greater than 50% gas there. So when you look at that 8,000 BOEs a day, you could think of that probably as being about 3 million or 3,000 barrels a day and about 30 million cubic feet of gas a day, right? So -- but with the addition of moving the rig back to the Permian, they're going to be a little more oily than what the chalk was. And I think we'll get back on track at -- here pretty quickly.
Leo Mariani: Okay. That's helpful. And then just wanted to ask on Egypt real quick. So you mentioned in your prepared comments, but your gross gas volumes were down quite a bit in the second quarter versus the prior quarter. I think you all had previously talked about several months back about trying to hold gas volumes kind of flattish in 2022. Was there anything anomalistic there, where maybe a plant went down for maintenance or something that caused the drop? Just trying to get a sense of some of those volumes are going to come back or maybe you just have some wells that maybe decline a lot or something?
John Christmann: No. I mean you've got 2 big things there. We've been focused on more oil-focused drilling with the current rig program. And then you've got [Kassar], which was a big gas field that we found along many, many years back, and it's been on a gradual decline. So there's time periods where you'll see the Kassar impact in those numbers.
Operator: I'll now hand the call back over to Chief Executive Officer, John Christmann, for any closing remarks.
Gary Clark: Andrew, it looks like we have 1 more analyst who has a question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. .
Neil Mehta: Yes. Thanks, team. I appreciate it. So 2 quick questions for me. First is in Suriname. There has been some talk of some -- I don't know, say, geopolitical tensions, but definitely political uncertainty down there. And so how does that affect the way that you and your partners are thinking about investing in the region? And the other is in the North Sea. Can you guys give us an update of how you're thinking about that basin and the profitability there? And particularly, in light of firm natural gas prices, but also around the risk of windfall taxes.
John Christmann: No. Two really good questions. I'll address Suriname first. Big picture, we feel really good about it. Neil, the offshore, which is a big plus in terms of where the operations are taking place. And I think it just underscores how important development of resource would be for the country of Suriname. And so Statoil's been there a long time. They've got a great track record, and we look forward to working with them and helping try to bring some energy and some GDP growth into the country. So I think it's a positive from that perspective. And it just shows you that in today's world, there are some challenges out there with inflation and other things going on and a lot of countries are addressing that, including Suriname. In the North Sea, I think we've got a very, very strong business there. We've always characterized our assets as kind of 2 different plays in 2 different -- 2 totally different assets. 40s, we're obviously managing it into the later phases of its life and looking to manage that margin. And as you see it wind down, we still see that happening early next decade. And you see the profits levy there starts to impact timing of some of those things. And so in the prepared remarks, my comments were this isn't helpful sometimes for future investment, and it may actually shorten the life of some things, but we're not facing that today with where it is. And then the other asset up there that we have still some great programs in and see some future development is in the tertiary at Beryl. And we've had some good strong programs and look forward to that. But I think you do have to just step back and look at your future capital, how it fits within the portfolio. But today, we see the North Sea playing a key role.
Operator: I am now showing no further questions. So with that, I'll hand the call back over to CEO, John Christmann, for any closing remarks.
John Christmann: Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to leave you with the following closing thoughts. We remain very focused on generating free cash flow. In 2022, this will be approximately $3 billion. We will return at least 60% or $1.8 billion to shareholders. Our new properties in the Delaware Basin are additive to this framework. It's an attractively priced tuck-in acquisition and cash flow accretive from day 1. In Egypt, well performance has been good, and we're actively addressing the above-ground inefficiencies to get well tie-ins back on schedule. Operator, I will now turn the call over to you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-05 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the APA Corporation First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Gary Clark : Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's First Quarter 2022 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann; Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development, Tracey Henderson, Senior Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations. Our prepared remarks will be around 20 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our first quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John Christmann : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. The first quarter brought a strengthening in both oil and gas prices to levels unseen since 2014. This quickly shifted the prevailing energy narrative to questions about spare capacity, energy security and whether producers could realistically deliver more reliable and affordable oil and natural gas. These are all very good questions and hopefully represent a more thoughtful outlook for our energy dialogue. At APA, we significantly increased our capital activity coming out of 2021, and we will remain squarely focused on executing on our 3-year plan, generating strong free cash flow, delivering on our shareholder return framework and continuing to deleverage our balance sheet. Since the beginning of 2021, we have made tremendous progress with debt reduction, which enabled the initiation of our capital return framework. In that time frame, we have reduced our outstanding bond debt by $3 billion, repurchased $1.1 billion of APA stock or roughly 10% of shares outstanding and increased annualized dividend to $0.50 per share. At current strip prices, we expect to generate approximately $2.9 billion of free cash flow in 2022. Based on our capital return framework, this would imply a minimum of $1.8 billion of return to shareholders. Thus, if commodity prices sustain at these levels, you should expect an acceleration in the pace of share buybacks through the rest of the year. With regard to our operational strategy and 3-year capital activity plan, we anticipate no material changes at this time. In Egypt, we have been increasing our rig count over the past year, investing in shorter cycle projects designed to deliver 8% to 10% compounded gross oil production growth over the next 3 years. In the U.S., a fourth rig, which was contracted in September, recently arrived and has begun operations. This should help return U.S. oil production to a modest rate of growth as planned. Given the substantial supply chain bottlenecks and scarcity of oil service equipment and field personnel, any attempt to increase activity in the U.S. would be logistically challenging and capital inefficient. In the North Sea, our plan calls for a stable drilling program with 1 floater and 1 platform rig, which should be capable of broadly sustaining production over the next 3 years. And lastly, we continue to explore and appraise our 2 large blocks offshore Suriname, which we believe have the potential to deliver a significant new source of lower carbon intensity oil production. Of equal importance to this investment activity is continuing to reduce emissions throughout our global operations and improving the health and welfare of our employees and the people in the communities where we operate. Turning now to some details of the first quarter. Our results continue to demonstrate the power of our unhedged diversified global upstream oil and gas portfolio. Some of the key highlights for the quarter include: free cash flow generation of $675 million, up 39% compared with $485 million in the preceding quarter. In addition to strong operational cash flows, we realized approximately $1 billion in proceeds from the sale of selected minerals acreage in the Delaware Basin and the monetization of a portion of our shares in Kinetic. We continue to return cash to shareholders through the dividend and ongoing share buybacks. During the first quarter, we repurchased $261 million of APA shares. Since initiating the buyback last October, we have repurchased more than 10% of the company's shares through the end of March at an average price of $29. We believe our stock is a compelling value and remain committed to this program as an important part of our returns framework. We also took another significant step forward in strengthening the balance sheet with $1.3 billion of bond debt reductions during the quarter. In terms of operational highlights, we exceeded our oil production target in the Permian Basin and continue to deliver significant productivity improvements in both the Delaware and Southern Midland Basins. We also announced an exploration discovery at Krabdagu on Block 58 in Suriname. Upstream capital investment in the quarter was approximately $360 million or $30 million below guidance, which was mostly driven by the delay of some activity into the second quarter. Despite the lower first quarter spend, we are increasing full year capital investment guidance by about 8% to $1.725 billion. Approximately half of this increase is associated with Suriname as we now plan to keep the Noble Jerry Desouza drillship in country following conclusion of operations at the Rasperwell in Block 53. Non-operated spending as well as some changes in our U.S. activity mix account for most of the remaining capital increase. Total adjusted production in the first quarter was 322,000 BOE per day, which was down about 3% from the fourth quarter and in line with expectations. Total U.S. volumes decreased 7% from the fourth quarter, driven primarily by well completion timing in the Delaware Basin Minerals divestiture in early March. U.S. oil production was nearly 70,000 barrels per day and continues to exceed expectations with Permian Basin wells demonstrating excellent performance. This offset some softness in natural gas and NGL production caused by weather events and unplanned third-party downtime. We have been consistent in noting that U.S. production will bottom in the second quarter as an increase in the number of wells placed on production in the second half of the year and incremental activity from a fourth rig should drive volumes higher. That fourth rig is now running in the Delaware Basin, where it is drilling out a previously unfinished 6-well pad at DXL in Reeves County. Following this, the rig will mobilize to Alpine High to resume gas and NGL development drilling in the summer. Outside the Permian Basin, 1 rig is currently delineating the Austin Chalk in Brazos County, where we are in the early stages of flowback on the first 3-well pad. Moving to international. First quarter adjusted volumes increased 8% compared to the fourth quarter driven by the positive impacts of our recently modernized PSC terms in Egypt. Adjusted production in Egypt was just over 68,000 BOEs per day consisting of 57% oil. We deferred a number of high rate uphole recompletions from the first quarter into the second quarter as the producing zones in these targeted wells were still delivering at economic rates. As a result, first quarter Egypt oil production was a bit below expectations. However, we are now seeing a significant uptick as this recompletion work is performed. We are in the process of adding our 13th rig in the Western Desert, with the 14th and 15th rigs expected by midyear as planned. Dave Pursell can provide more color on our Egypt operations during Q&A. In the North Sea, production of 43,000 BOE per day was impacted by unplanned downtime at the Forties Echo platform. This resulted in the loss of 2,300 barrels of oil per day for approximately half of the first quarter, and we expect required repair work will keep these volumes offline through the end of the second quarter. Scheduled turnaround repair and maintenance work will also be conducted at both barrel and Forties through the summer. So we expect North Sea production to decrease for the next 2 quarters before rebounding in the fourth quarter. Moving on to Suriname. In Block 53, we spread the Rasp per exploration well in late March and are drilling above the target zones at this time. We will update the status of this prospect at the appropriate time. In Block 58, we are focused on drilling a prioritized list of exploration and appraisal wells in the central portion of the block to assess and appraise resource, scope and scale to underpin and optimize a potential first development. At the previously announced Krabdagu discovery, flow testing is complete and we are now in the buildup stage in both tested zones. After we have obtained and analyze this data, we will provide more details. Following conclusion of operations at Krabdagu, the Maersk Valiant will mobilize to the nearby Dico exploration prospect. Before turning the call over to Steve, I'd like to make a few remarks about our ESG progress. We have multiple initiatives underway within our focus areas of air, water and people, and we are piloting and investing in a number of technologies to support the measurement, understanding and reduction of our emissions footprint. In Egypt, we recently completed 2 projects that are making an immediate and material contribution toward our goal this year of reducing upstream flaring in our Western Desert operations by 40%. I will close by commenting on a frequent question that E&P companies are receiving from industry watchers. That is how will capital investment programs and capital return frameworks change in the context of sustained higher oil and gas prices. As I noted at the beginning of the call, we do not currently anticipate any significant changes to the activity levels set forth in our 3-year program. APA remains committed to safe and steady and efficient operations in all of our regions and returning a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney.
Steve Riney : Thanks, John. For the first quarter of 2022, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported consolidated net income of $1.88 billion or $5.43 per diluted common share. As is commonly the case, our results include several items that are outside of APA's core earnings. The most significant of these was $1.1 billion of after-tax gains on the divestments of Altus Midstream and the Delaware Basin minerals package. Other material items included a $187 million benefit, related to a release of tax valuation allowance to offset deferred U.S. income tax expense or a $53 million charge for early extinguishment of debt associated with our March bond tender. Excluding these and some other smaller items, adjusted net income for the first quarter was $668 million or $1.92 per diluted common share. In our financial and operation supplement, you can find detailed tables for all of our non-GAAP financial measures, including 1 for adjusted earnings. Our first quarter results underscore APA's strong free cash flow generating capacity. The impact of the Egypt PSC modernization on production volumes, combined with the higher commodity price environment, drove a 39% increase in first quarter free cash flow compared to the preceding quarter. Cost inflation has become a popular topic in quarterly earnings calls and for good reason. We embedded a good amount of cost pressure into the budgets we laid out in February. And for the most part, costs are tracking close to that plan. However, 1 cost issue in the first quarter that was not fully captured in guidance is related to equity-linked compensation. So let me go through a few details on that with you. You may recall that we have multiple equity-linked compensation plans that are denominated in APA shares. As these plans vest, some are paid out in actual shares and some are paid out in cash, we accrue the anticipated cost of these plans each calendar quarter through their various vesting periods. For the payers that pay out in cash, the accounting is a little more complicated. In the fourth quarter of 2021 and now, again, in the first quarter of 2022. These plans had a significant impact on our results for 3 key reasons, all related to improved underlying business performance and share price performance over the last several months. First, since we accrue the cost of these plans at the quarter end share price, our quarterly cost accrual has been increasing substantially with the near doubling of our share price since the beginning of October. Second, the cumulative number of shares that are accrued but not yet paid out must be mark-to-market at the end of each quarter. The first quarter results include a large mark-to-market impact again due to the significant share price increase since January 1. Third, as a result of the improved business performance and relative share price, the variable payout plans now appear likely to pay out at a higher level than previously anticipated. So we are increasing the accrual levels accordingly. These stock plans apply to nearly the entire employee base. So some costs will flow to LOE and some to CapEx, but most will flow through G&A. As a result, G&A is notably above our previous guidance and market expectations. We have revised our G&A guidance for the remainder of this year accordingly. That said, stock price movement due to its unpredictable nature will continue to impact quarterly results beyond our revised guidance. We achieved a significant milestone during the first quarter with the closing of the Altus Midstream Eagle Claw business combination and the monetization of a portion of our ownership in the resulting entity Kinetic Holdings. Accounting rules require that we consolidate Altus' profit and loss through the February 22nd merger date. So you will see a partial quarter for these items reflected on our income statement. From a balance sheet perspective, upon closing of the transaction and reduction of our ownership to a minority interest, we will no longer consolidate Altus' balance sheet. As a result, $1.4 billion of debt and redeemable preferred equity from the 2021 year-end balance sheet are no longer consolidated. This could have a significant positive impact on various APA debt metrics, depending on how you calculate it. Subsequent to the completion of the transaction, APA sold 4 million shares of our Kinetic common stock holdings in March for net proceeds of $224 million. At quarter end, the market value of APA's remaining 8.9 million Kinetic shares was approximately $580 million. At this point, we view Kinetic as a noncore holding and following the expiry of our lockup period in February of 2023, we will evaluate the potential for further monetization of our position. In the meantime, we continue to see this as an attractive investment with a leading Delaware Basin footprint, stable cash flows, a strong dividend and attractive near-term growth potential. Turning now to the progress we've made during the quarter on our balance sheet. In addition to the deconsolidation of Kinetic, APA completed 2 important steps on the path to reducing leverage and maintaining strong liquidity. First, we initiated a tender offer in March for $500 million of outstanding bonds. We upsized the tender to $1.1 billion, with a focus on repurchasing shorter maturity bonds. This extended our average maturity to approximately 16 years and reduced our annual bond interest expense by approximately $50 million. To accommodate the upsized tender, we temporarily drew on our revolver, which ended the quarter with a balance of $880 million. By the end of April, however, we reduced the revolver balance to $680 million. By the end of the year, we plan to use a portion of free cash flow to pay off the revolver and to call at par $123 million of bonds maturing in January 2023. We also recently refinanced Apache Corporation's revolving credit facility. The new facilities, which have been moved up to the APA corporation level and had 5-year primary terms, consist of a $1.8 billion revolving credit facility and a GBP 1.5 billion letter of credit facility, which will be used for LC postings related to the abandonment obligations in the North Sea. These efforts, along with our robust cash flow generation and deconsolidation of Kinetic have already been recognized by 1 rating agency. Fitch recently upgraded Apache to investment grade with a BBB- rating and a stable outlook. I would like to close by discussing some changes to our 2022 production guidance, which can be seen in our financial and operational supplement. Our full year U.S. production guidance is unchanged at this time, with oil volumes continuing to perform well. Reported production guidance for Egypt is down roughly 4%, the majority of which is associated with the impact of higher oil prices on our PSC cost recovery volumes. In the North Sea, we have reduced our full year production outlook by 1,000 BOEs per day, primarily to reflect first half unplanned downtime. Outside of these production impacts and the activity changes that John spoke of, the only other material change to our full year guidance is an $85 million increase in G&A expense, which reflects the equity-linked compensation-related accrual impacts previously discussed. Please refer to our financial and operational supplement or follow up with Gary and his team for any questions related to our updated guidance.  And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America.
Doug Leggate: I think you asked me. So John, I'm going to start -- maybe I'll try to for here. On Suriname on the buyback, the 60% of free cash flow you obviously fell quite a bit below that in the first quarter. But my understanding is when you have non-public information on the well test that you can't actually be in the market. So I wonder -- my 2 for it is, I wonder if you could give us a more fulsome update as to whether you feel like you are still making progress towards a development and FID this year. And whether at this point, you are able to be back in the market taking advantage of, for example, today's share price weakness. And I've got a follow-up, please.
John Christmann: Okay. No, Doug, great question. First off, I'll say we are committed to the return framework of a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders, and we are committed to that, and we are committed to that for the calendar year of 2022. We do have periods where you have material nonpublic and we have to use other vehicles in that plan ahead with [ten V51s] and so forth. So there are periods where we have to rely on those and think ahead. We have completed the flow test at Krabdagu. We are now in the important buildup stage. And as you know, Doug, and I appreciate, sometimes the buildup can be as important as the flow test are more important. So we're excited about where we are. At this point, we're not going to dribble information out on Krabdagu. We'll wait and come back with a report at the appropriate time. But I would say there have been no surprises. As we think about a path to FID in Suriname, we're kind of moving more towards what I'll call a central area hub concept. And it's something that we're excited about and starting to think about with Total. You've got a foundational piece at Sapakara South. We think Krabdagu can also be a foundational piece, but I'm going to hold comments there until we're ready to talk about that. And we prioritized a list of both exploration and appraisal targets that we need to drill. Obviously, the appraisal targets are helping us find connected volumes, which are critical to scope and scale and the exploration targets that are sizable, we also need to drill to make sure you would get the scope and scale right of that potential first FID. So things are on track. We're excited about how things are progressing. We did say the Maersk Valiant will be moving to an exploration target next, which is DCP. So we're excited about that. And quite frankly, things are progressing nicely. In Block 53, while I'm on Suriname, we're drilling Rasper. As we said in the prepared remarks, we're above the target zones. But we are excited about Rasper, and we'll come back on that when we can talk about it. And we also said we will be retaining the Noble Jury to SUSA in country in Suriname, which is 1 of the reasons why the CapEx is going up.
Steve Riney: And Doug, this is Steve. If I could weigh in on the second part of your question about the pace of buybacks and uses of cash. So as John said in his prepared remarks, we anticipate a strip, about $2.9 billion of free cash flow this year. That would imply at least $1.8 billion, as we said, in returns to shareholders. In the first quarter, we -- between dividends and share buybacks, we did just a little over $300 million. So we're a little bit above a 15% payout at that implied pace of annual payouts. And I think there was some activity that may have been limited due to MNPI. But I think also, you don't start the year with guns a blazing, you start probably on a conservative pace. We also, as you know, chose to do something on the debt side. But as John said, we absolutely remain committed to the full year payout of 60% of free cash flow and we actively plan around periods of MNPI. So we understand what that does to us, and there are other mechanisms we can use from time to time to be able to be in the market and buying back shares.
Doug Leggate: Hopefully, my second -- my follow-up, I'll let someone was taking to the soon. I think there's 2 tests going on, so I'm sure others will get into that. But I want to ask you about the trajectory in Egypt. This is the first quarter since the normal modernization. There's are a few mixed counties in there that I think might have surprised some people. So certainly surprised me a little bit more gas. What is the trajectory to how you see your adjusted volumes after minorities and tax files or tax molecules? Can you give an idea what that looks like? And I'll leave it at that.
John Christmann: Yes. And I think if you step back big picture in Egypt, Doug, we've been declining gross operated production for a number of years. And the key to modernization was it facilitates the investment levels. And so you've seen us really ramp the rig count, really in the back half of last year, second half, we went from 5 to 11 rigs. We're at 12 today. We're in the process of picking up a 13th and 14th rig fairly soon, and will likely go 1 or 2 higher than that. I think when you look at modernization, you have to look at the net. So despite a rising oil price, our net production was up 13% in Q1, and that's really the benefits of modernization. And that's with growth staying relatively flat as you're now starting to see that curve turn. April production is moving up quite a bit.  And I'll let Mr. Pursell jump in and provide some more details here.
Dave Pursell: Yes. Doug, so we'll get to your mix, we'll answer the mix question, but it's important to give you the preamble before that. And as John said, April production is moving higher, we're up to -- we're up 8% as we've exited April here relative to the first quarter. So we've got the oil production trajectory the way we like it. And really, that's driven by a couple of things: continue to increase drilling rig count. We talked about we'll be up to 15 rigs by the middle of the year. Those drilling rigs really focused on oil have an oil-focused is both exploration and production. We talked in the supplement. We've had a couple of nice exploration successes is at Pita and Hazem Northwest or Pita West and Hazem Northwest. Our development drilling is on track. We did have some delays on recompletions in the first quarter moved into the second quarter, but we're -- we think we're on track to continue to grow oil production in that. So the oil production mix will continue to improve or increase over time relative to gas. I think -- and I'll let Gary kind of offline, walk you through the blood guts and feathers of this. But when you think about the modernized terms, it's also a simplified structure. And so we think going forward that the adjusted and reported mix should mimic and track the gross mix very closely. So there won't be that ambiguity in how you roll up into the adjusted and reported numbers. So we think growth is what you should focus on, and that gross oil mix is going to improve as we continue to focus on oil development here over the next several years.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman from Raymond James.
John Freeman: The first question I had, when you mentioned that about half the CapEx increase was related to the increased activity in Suriname with the decision to keep the Desousa drillship starting on falling Raper. And I'm just wondering if there's a way to maybe give a little bit more color on how exactly you all go about estimating the incremental CapEx there given, obviously, your CapEx obligations are materially different, whether it's appraisal or exploration-related activity in Block 58 as well as out of that rig, drill simply split time between Block 58 -- Block 53. It's just a lot of different scenarios, and I'm just wondering kind of how you all kind of came up with some risk kind of CapEx number?
John Christmann: Well, John, we're going to keep the Desousa. There's -- you could think about an exploration well in Block 58, where we've got 50% or another well in Block 53, where we got 45% pretty similar. Obviously, if it's appraisal wells in Block 58, they're going to be less because of the carry. So -- and there's also the ability to keep the Desousa for maybe more than 1 well. So I'll just leave it at that. It will stay in country, and we're still working through details, but we felt like we ought to at least move it up from the amount we've moved it up, and we think it's a good number.
John Freeman: So is it -- not to try and put wording about some, but is it fair to say that if all of the incremental activity with Desousa ended up being appraisal that, that CapEx number might come down some?
John Christmann: Potentially could. But I would anticipate -- we've got risked exploration and appraisal wells. So it's going to be both.
John Freeman: Okay. Okay. And then just my follow-up, kind of sticking with the CapEx side. So on the U.S., where it was due to the increased non-op activity and then you mentioned the mix change in your activity, some higher working interest, is it possible at all to sort of say, of the incremental CapEx associated in the U.S. kind of the split between it being due to kind of increased activity/higher working interest stuff versus just cost inflation that we've been hearing about these calls the last few days.
John Christmann: Yes, John, I think, as you know, we built in quite a bit of inflation into our capital numbers with what we laid out first quarter. So the majority of this is we do have some wells that are going to be higher working interest than what we had originally planned, and that's just a function of shifting some pads and moving some pads forward. So there will be some higher working interest. And then we do have some increased non-op capital, some of that could be increased activity and then some of that could be some inflation on the other operators, too. It's hard to dig in and understand that, but it's really what we're just seeing on the non-op side moving up. And so those 2 factors kind of come to play together there on that. But I think we've done a pretty good job of anticipating the inflation and the increases in our 2022 plan. And I think that's playing out kind of as we budgeted and forecasted.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan Chase.
Arun Jayaram: Yes. John, I was wondering if you could give us an update on your marketing agreement with Cheniere on Stage 3, I believe you have the ability to sell 140,000 MMBtu to them. Obviously, a very, very good pricing environment. So I was wondering if you could give us some details the timing of when that could kick in and perhaps the operating leverage there between your leverage to this and the North Sea exposure to global gas?
John Christmann: I'll let Steve dive in. I wish it was a bigger contract, but I'll let Steve dive in on the details.
Steve Riney: Yes. We wish it was bigger, and we wish it was sooner. So that contract, that's a 15-year contract. You got the basic terms right, Arun. And that one contractually begins on July 1, 2023. At any point in time now, Cheniere does have the option with 30 days notice -- or 90 days notice, sorry, to elect to start that contract early. They haven't given us that notice. So we would like to obviously get that one at any point in time. But if we do, we'll start at 90 days later or any other time frame that we might agree with them within that. So it's a fair option to be able to do that. And we obviously can't disclose the terms of that contract. But suffice it to say, what we do is we select a mix of Asian versus European pricing and we effectively sell our gas, we deliver gas on the Gulf Coast. We sell it at this mix for a full year, a mix of Asian and European pricing. And then we net back through liquefaction fees, transport fees and a marketing fee that we pay. So we're were, in effect, fully exposed to the European and Asian LNG market pricing for that 15-year period.
Arun Jayaram: Great. And that starts mid of next year unless Cheniere elects to early stress that.
Steve Riney: Exactly.
Arun Jayaram: Okay. Great. And just my follow-up is on Egypt. John, you guys have highlighted your the expectation to grow your oil volumes there by 8% to 10% kind of per annum. Just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about how your early results are trending. It does sound like things are -- when you got the recompletions going that you are starting to see some growth there. But I was wondering if you can maybe dig down and give us a sense of the trajectory of growth, any supply chain headwinds in country? Obviously, you guys are rapidly expanding activity, but give us a sense of what you're seeing on the ground in Egypt.
John Christmann: No. It's – number 1, it's good to get back to work and kind of move our activity levels up to where we can grow that production base. I think we've got a couple of key discoveries to build on. I think the Pita West in between Pita and Barnes is a nice early win. It's going to give us some things that we can get on fairly quickly. We did get some of the recompletions underway. And as Dave mentioned, I think we're up about 8% in April over the first quarter already. So it just takes a little bit of time, but things are progressing. And then there's a couple of other discoveries that have been nice. So we're going to be focused on oil drilling. We're kind of prioritizing that. We've got the Northwest Razak concession that we're -- we shot seismic on and it's kind of a new frontier for us. So -- we've got some nice exploration wells that we're also excited about. But lots of inventory, Arun, and we feel good about the plans that we've laid out, and we're kind of getting our feet under us and getting going. So anything you want to pile on, Dave?
Dave Pursell: John answered the supply question really well. The trajectory we're very we're still confident in the path that we laid out. I think on the supply chain questions, remember, in Egypt, we're drilling relatively conventional. These are conventional wells are vertical. We don't have much, if any, hydraulic fracturing activity in country. So these are, I would call it, kind of commodity sort of wells. But that said, our supply chain team is all over it. They're making sure that we're not waiting on parts. So we've -- as we ramp up, one of the nice things about having a visibility on the plan as it gives the supply chain folks lead time to really make sure that we have all the equipment necessary to keep the program moving forward. And so far, that's been the case.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Scialla from Stifel.
Michael Scialla: You're getting close to 1x debt leverage now. Stevie, you said one of the agencies upgraded the debt rating to investment grade. Stock's also done well this year, but it sounds like you're still focused on debt reduction and share buybacks. So I guess with that in mind, I want to see how you view the intrinsic value of the company relative to the current stock price and how you weigh that versus potentially increasing the dividend?
Steve Riney: Yes, Michael. So yes, a number of questions in there. I think that the key answer to your question would be -- or the key part of your question would be that we still see our share price is undervalued, and we like the buyback program, and we like it quite a bit. But your reference to the amount of debt reduction that we've done, just to step back from it a bit. In the last 9 months, we've done $3 billion of bond elimination, which is just a phenomenal compared to what you think we might have been able to do just 12 to 18 months ago. Certainly, the balance sheet is much, much stronger today, and then Fitch was the first one to recognize that and acknowledge it. We are in conversations with all 3 rating agencies, and we continue to work the debt rating hard with all 3 of them. I think we'll continue along the lines of balance sheet strengthening, but I think it's unlikely that you're going to see the large chunks of debt tender activity, the $1 billion-plus. We're -- as long as we stay in this price environment, we're going to have significant amount of free cash flow over the next 3 years. And there will be continued balance sheet strengthening, but there will be a significant focus on share buybacks as well as long as the share price, in our view, stays undervalued, which is what it is now. And we talk about the dividend all the time. We talk about it often, and we've raised it twice in the back half of last year. And we'll continue to look at that. And as the balance sheet gets stronger, as prices continue to play out the way they are and as share price improves, on an absolute and relative basis, then we'll certainly think more seriously about the dividend. But for right now, we're quite happy with the buyback program.
Michael Scialla: Great. That helps. Second question was a marketing question. I guess, with the deconsolidation of Altus, I believe you retained your firm transportation for gas out of the Permian. I want to see if you plan to use all of that or if you have thoughts on monetizing any excess capacity there?
Steve Riney: Well, as you know, we did monetize some of that in prior years. And we have -- we have about -- in round numbers, we have a little over $670 million a day of transport capacity on PHP and Gulf Coast Express. We have -- as we look forward to the next -- the remainder of this year and into next year, we have, on average, somewhere in the $200 million to $225 million a day of excess capacity. Would we be open to potentially marketing some of that? Yes, I mean, we would entertain a conversation on that, for sure. But at the same time, the differentials look good for the next 2 years. And as you'll probably see in our results and our postings that we have actually gone and we've now locked in those differentials on about 90% of that excess capacity all the way through the end of '23. And in doing so, there's a mixture. We put in some hedges in earlier time periods that were not quite as attractive as they are these days. But we've put in quite a bit just recently. And we've locked in about a little under $50 million of cash margin on that transport capacity. And then the rest of the capacity will be used. We use all of it. And effectively, it gets Gulf Coast pricing on our equity volumes. But that -- we sell all of our equity volumes in basin and then our marketing group buys 670 million a day and transports it and then resells it on the Gulf Coast.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade from Johnson Rice.
Charles Meade: John, to you and the rest of your team there. I mentioned this is a question for you or perhaps for Tracey. Can you give us kind of the background and the providence of this [indiscernible] I don't know exactly the way to pronounce it, the new tick up prospect and perhaps wrap into it, whether it kind of rise into the top of the power here is connected to your central area hub development concept?
John Christmann: Yes, Charles, I will tell you, it is something that would fall in that area. It's an exploration well, and I'm happy to have Tracey say a few things about it, so.
Tracey Henderson: Sure Charles. As John mentioned in the original comments, we're going to be testing sort of a range of different prospects with different attributes in a list in support of looking at appraisal and exploration prospects. So I would say, the Diku wells at the front of the schedule. It's a well that Total really likes with some potential meaningful reserves. So we see it, I think, is a bit higher risk, higher reward because it does have some different seismic attributes than we've tested, but it has the potential to unlock, I would say, some additional follow-on prospectivity, that could incrementally and substantially but more reserves. So I think it's one we're anxious to see, but it is a bit of a different beast than what we've seen before, but has potential to be meaningful for the appraisal.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets.
Scott Hanold : A quick question on the Desousa rig that's in Block 53. If it stays in country. It sounds like it's going to move to Block 58. Would you all continue to be the operator of that rig? Or would you hand that over to Total?
John Christmann: Scott, it could stay in Block 53 or we could move it to 58, and let Total take it. So there's optionality there, and I'll just -- I'll leave it at that for now.
Scott Hanold : Okay. But just to clarify, if it did go to 58, they would take over operatorship. Is that right?
John Christmann: They are the operator in 58 and we're the operator in 53. So there's a lot of things you can work out. But we're not going -- wouldn't be changing -- they've got the value at working, so.
Scott Hanold : Okay. Understood. And then Alpine High, obviously, with where gas prices are, looks a lot more interesting. You guys are moving a rig there and going to resuscitate those volumes. Can you think about big picture? Obviously, Steve talked about the potential excess capacity you all have with your FT. And I know in past – in the beginning of the Alpine High history, I guess, you all talked about Mexico being an option there to descend gas. But like as you think about gas prices, optionality between LNG, maybe Mexico still yet? How do you think about that longer term? Are you guys going to keep a rig there? Do you – could you move more on there? Do the economics really warrant ramping up much? Just give a little bit color on that, that would be great.
A –John Christmann: No. We’ve – we started last September picking up a rig in the U.S. It’s going to be a Delaware Basin focused rig. It’s now working in our DXL area. We had a pad there that was partially drilled. And so we wanted to drill that out first, and then it will be moving to Alpine High. We’re excited about what those economics look like, right? If you look back at the Willow well, and we had some details in our supplement there. It was one of the best wells we brought on last year of all of our DUCs. I think it has cumed over 9 Bcf, and it’s been on since really January of ‘21. So we are excited about those economics. I think they compete well, and we’re anxious to get a rig back to work as there’s plenty of infrastructure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research.
Bob Brackett: I'll try fishing off Suriname a bit. In terms of the Jerry DeSousa, when did the decision to keep that rig occur? Did it occur after you'd spudded RASPER? And a related question, is there an obvious sidetrack to RASPER?
John Christmann: We're above target zones at RASPER, Bob. So I'll just leave it at that.
Clay Bretches: How about a follow-up. If we talk about the Krabdagoe flow test, the fact that you went on to the next step of buildup suggests that you flowed oil through a sufficiently permeable reservoir that it makes sense to do a longer-term test. Am I getting the engineering right on that?
John Christmann: We're doing a buildup. So we're in the buildup phase, and I said there were no surprises. So I'll leave it at that.
Bob Brackett: And a final question would just be the restricted flow test at Sapakara South flowed 4,800 barrels of oil, I think. So that -- is that in the realm of no surprises?
John Christmann: I'll just say there were no surprises, and we may not have expected there to be a restricted flow test, but I'll leave it at that. Your questions are always fun, bob, and creative.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng : Two quick questions, John. Two quick questions. Can you tell us that how many wells do you expect to grow in Alpine High this year? And secondly, that I know it's really early, but given the inflationary environment and the activity level, what is your preliminary give and take, different component in the 2023 budget may look like? Any direction that you can point to?
John Christmann: In terms of number of wells, Dave?
Dave Pursell: Yes, Paul, this is Dave Pursell. Number of wells at Alpine later this year, it will just be a handful because we're -- as John said, we're finishing up an undrilled uncompleted pad at DXL, then we'll move to Alpine. And these are all going to be longer laterals with relatively large stimulation treatment. So it will be a handful of wells that are ready to come online at the end of the year, so.
John Christmann: Your second part of your question, Paul, it was hard to hear.
Paul Cheng : I was saying that. I know it's early, but for 2023, any kind of direction you can point to on the preliminary budget and activity levels?
John Christmann: Yes. I mean I would say today, as we look at 2023, our 3-year plan we laid out this year looks pretty darn good to us, right? We've added the fourth rig in the U.S. we'll be at 15 rigs in Egypt. So right now, we're not envisioning any increases to the 3-year plan that we laid out at the start of this year.
Paul Cheng : Okay. And how about in the budget given the inflation, I mean, how much additional costs that we should be taking into consideration?
John Christmann: Yes. I mean we'll wait until next February to come out with a hard number for '23, we did have an increased dial in for additional inflation in '23, but I'm not in a position to really give you that number right now. A little early.
Operator: Your next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta : John and team. The first question is around the North Sea. And just want to get your perspective on the production cadence there. As you've already indicated, it's going to be a heavy turnaround schedule through the summer. And -- but how are you feeling about the exit rate of 50,000 BOE a day and just any update around activity plans there?
John Christmann: Yes, Neil, we're still with the North Sea. We've got a heavy turnaround period coming up that we're anxious to get on and get through. I think it's executing and that's going to be key. I think we've got good news that the Ocean Patriot is back in the field or arriving today. So -- that's been one of the other items that we basically lost an entire quarter with the drilling of the Ocean Patriot, which when you're only running 1 floater and you lose it for a quarter, it had to go in. It had a large anchor chain that had broke and had to be repaired. So I think we feel good about the prospects that are on that rig line and the work that's ahead of us and the repair works. We feel good about the exit rate, which should be around 50,000, so --
Neil Mehta : All right. And then the follow-up is, you operate a global portfolio here. Talk about the inflationary forces that you're seeing in the U.S. relative to international, fair to say, thus far, a lot of your peers have reported more inflation in their U.S. business relative to international. But how do you see that playing out over the next 12 months?
John Christmann: Well, I mean, I think we do operate a global portfolio. I think it's a function of staying ahead. We had a lot of our 2022 program under contract. And so we had cranked a lot of that in the last quarter when we announced budget. So we feel good about what we dialed in and where that sits. I think a lot of it just depends on where you are and what the demand for that equipment is. And you typically do see higher increases in the U.S. and then more volatility and more stable prices internationally. But I think the thing that's a little bit different this time is we're not all just fighting over rig count rigs. And -- which drives that hyperinflation. So -- but there's no doubt, commodities are going up, fuel is going up, steel, sand So as you look out, costs are going up. And then the other thing, if you look back over the last few years, there's not been a lot of equipment that was built. And so a lot of the parts that were needed to keep rigs running and frac crews running have been cannibalized off of older equipment. So there's no doubt, as you look out over the next couple of years, if the price deck holds, you're going to see some higher prices. Dave, anything you want to add to that?
Dave Pursell: Yes. I think when you look at inflation, it's people, steel, chemicals and diesel. You can't -- I mean, that's ubiquitous around the world. When you look at the Permian relative to the rest of the global portfolio, you're running higher spec and kind of higher-end equipment in the Permian, which will have -- and there's more competition for that equipment. Both those things create more pressure and you've got the pressure pumping and big frac component of the wells in the Permian that is -- can be fairly or significantly inflationary, which we don't see in either Egypt or the North Sea. So I think that's the real kind of categorical breakdown.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani from KeyBanc.
Leo Mariani: I just wanted to follow up on some of the prepared comments here. You all kind of describe Safacura South as a potential kind of foundational part of a project and said kind of stay tuned on Krabdagoe. I mean I think there's a plan for Total as kind of talked about maybe hitting FID at the end of the year. But am I reading some pretty good confidence out of you guys in terms of what you've seen so far that you think there's certainly a sizable, viable economic project here?
John Christmann: At this point, Leo, we have not announced a project or an FID. I think we've said from the get-go that Sapakara South is a foundational piece. We've shown it's gotten bigger with the extended buildup time as we raised that original estimate from the connected volume just to the 1 well, and I want to emphasize again, that's just via the 1 initial well was 325 million to 375 million barrels. We raised that to greater than 400 million. And that area continues to get bigger and there's more appraisal to do at Sapakara South. So I think we have confidence in what we have found, and we like the program, but there's still more work to do.
Leo Mariani: Okay. And then just on the North Sea, you all certainly said you've got confidence on this 50,000 BOE per day exit rate. I guess are there some particular wells that you all need to kind of tie in. I know there's a bunch of downtime of turnarounds here this summer. But are there a project or 2 that are kind of chunky that you guys are going to be bringing on, on the well side that gives you confidence in that number?
John Christmann: Yes, there's a Garden well that the Ocean Patriot was scheduled to drill, and we've had to slide that back. But those Garden wells have been high rate, and it's a very, very good location.
Operator: And there are no further questions over the phone line. I'd like now to hand the call over to John Christmann, CEO. Please go ahead, sir.
John Christmann : Yes. Thank you for participating on our call today. I'd like to leave you with the following closing thoughts. Financially, we have become a much stronger company. We will remain disciplined, both financially and operationally. Lastly, we are committed to our shareholder returns framework, returning a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.  Operator, I will now turn the call over to you. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Thank you, presenters. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-22 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the APA Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Announcement. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I'd now like to hand the conference over to Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Gary Clark: Good morning, and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2021 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and 2022 outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development; Tracey Henderson, Senior Vice President of Exploration; and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 25 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our fourth quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the difference between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt's tax barrels. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. At the beginning of each year, I'd like to look back and reflect on our progress and 2021 marked an important turning point for APA Corporation. While there is clearly much more to accomplish, I believe we made outstanding progress on 6 specific fronts last year. First, we demonstrated the robust cash flow capacity of our base business. We entered 2021 with a plan to generate around $350 million of free cash flow assuming $45 WTI. By being mostly unhedged and with the benefit of a $68 average WTI price tailwind, free cash flow exceeded our plan by nearly $1.5 billion and came in at $1.8 billion for the year. This represents the highest annual free cash flow in more than a decade and is one of the highest in the company's 67-year history. Keep in mind, these results do not include any free cash flow uplift that will come following the Egypt PSC modernization we completed in late December. The free cash flow capacity of our base business has significantly improved over the past few years. We have accomplished this improvement through multiple initiatives focused on portfolio enhancement, improved capital allocation and capital productivity, per barrel margin expansion and relentless overhead cost rationalization. Although we are getting some traction in the market, we believe our free cash flow capacity is still not fully appreciated. Second, we strengthened the company financially. By maintaining capital discipline and investing at a level slightly below our plan, we let the strengthening oil price flow directly through to the balance sheet reducing upstream net debt in 2021 by $1.2 billion. In 1 year, we accomplished what we thought would take multiple years and made great progress toward our goal of returning to investment-grade status. Third, we initiated a capital return framework for our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, on the back of a strengthening balance sheet we implemented a robust long-term framework for returning capital to shareholders. Reducing debt was and continues to be important. However, we reached a point in 2021 where it became appropriate for equity holders to participate more directly and materially in cash returns. We feel our 60% return framework is a good balance, providing near-term cash returns to shareholders while still recognizing the importance of longer-term balance sheet strengthening. Thus far, we have returned capital under the new framework, primarily through share repurchases as we bought back nearly 8.5% of outstanding shares during the fourth quarter. We felt this was appropriate given the sizable gap in the free cash flow yield at which our stock was trading relative to our peer group. We are committed to returning capital under the 60% framework for the long term and anticipate a progressively larger dividend component as we see improvement in our relative share price performance, further strengthening of our balance sheet and reduced oil and gas price volatility. Fourth, we refreshed the economic foundation for our business in Egypt. At the end of December, we finalized our agreement to modernize the terms of our production sharing contracts in Egypt. We have a long history with Egypt, and this agreement sets the foundation for many years of a mutually beneficial partnership. The improved PSC terms return Egypt to the best long-term investment opportunity in our portfolio. In turn, this incentivizes increased capital spending and a return to long-term production growth. This is a tremendous outcome for both Egypt and for APA. Fifth, we continue to streamline our Permian portfolio. In 2021, we sold $256 million of noncore assets in the Permian Basin, and we plan to close on the sale of an $805 million minerals rights package in the Delaware Basin within the next week. You should anticipate continued noncore Permian asset sales.  And finally, we made good progress toward a potential FID in Suriname. In November, we announced a successful flow test and pressure build-up at our Sapakara South appraisal well. With further information and analysis, we are increasing our estimate of the connected resource in place in a single zone at Sapakara South-1 to more than 400 million barrels. We look forward to additional appraisal that should further increase the estimated resource in place at Sapakara South. We also announced a follow-on discovery at Krabdagu, which lies approximately 18 kilometers to the east of Sapakara South. We will initiate flow testing at Krabdagu in the coming days, and we'll share more details at the appropriate time. 2021 was also a transformational year for Altus. This week, we plan to close the previously announced merger with privately held EagleClaw Midstream, which will significantly scale the business and reduce APA's ownership to a minority interest. The combination creates the largest and best-in-class gathering, processing and transportation company in the Delaware Basin with capacity for product delivery to the Gulf Coast. The outlook for the new company is strong, and their plan is to maintain and ultimately grow the $6 per share dividend. For APA, this transaction enables deconsolidation of the midstream business and its associated debt. It also provides APA an opportunity for near-term liquidity of almost 1/3 of our 12.9 million Altus shares. 2021 was also a year of significant progress on our ESG initiatives and safety performance. We firmly believe that being proactive with respect to ESG is 1 of the most important strategic imperatives facing our industry. Our collective ability to meet much needed energy demand while also reducing emissions will determine our long-term success and viability. APA is committed to being part of the solution and part of the future, and we plan to demonstrate that commitment through a strong bias for near-term actions that will make a real difference.  In 2021, we set an ambitious goal of eliminating routine flaring in the Permian Basin by year-end, which we accomplished 3 months ahead of schedule. APA is the first amongst its publicly traded peers in the Permian to end routine flaring, and we applaud the numerous companies that are now taking measures to do the same. APA also seeks continuous improvement in our safety performance and protocols. In 2021, we achieved a significant improvement in the 3 key safety indicators that impact the annual incentive compensation of every employee in the company. I am proud of our teams for delivering these results. The task now is to build on these successes in the future. In summary, 2021 was a year of outstanding progress for APA. The achievements I just highlighted along with several important ongoing initiatives will improve our operational and financial performance and sustainability for years to come. Turning now to the fourth quarter results. APA generated $1.3 billion of adjusted EBITDAX, making it our best quarter of the year. Upstream capital spending was $334 million for the quarter and $1.06 billion for the full year, both of which were below guidance. U.S. production exceeded guidance again in the fourth quarter as we continue to deliver good performance from our Permian oil plays and at Alpine High. Our focus was on increasing efficiencies through longer laterals, optimize well spacing and enhanced completion design. The success of these initiatives was recently recognized by JPMorgan analyst, Arun Jayaram who named APA as a top performer in his analysis of 2021 Midland Basin Well Performance. As we noted in prior calls, U.S. well connections in the second half of 2021 were significantly lower than in the first half due to the timing of our DUC completion program. Accordingly, we placed only 13 wells online in the U.S. during the fourth quarter, 11 of which were in the Southern Midland Basin. The remaining 2 completions were in the East Texas Austin Chalk. In October, a dedicated rig arrived in the Austin Chalk and initiated a drilling program that is expected to run through 2022. Internationally, gross production was up in the fourth quarter. However, adjusted volumes were below guidance due to unplanned downtime in the North Sea during the month of December. On the cost side, LOE increased again in the fourth quarter and was higher than our guidance. We have begun to see the impacts of inflation, particularly in fuel, chemicals, labor and steel costs. These pressures are showing up in all areas of spend. In yesterday's earnings materials, we set forth some high-level guidance on APA's 3-year outlook which I would now like to provide a bit more color around. With the onset of the pandemic at the beginning of 2020 and the resulting oil price collapse, we cut capital investment to protect the balance sheet. As a result, our base production levels have been in decline for the last 2 years. With the stronger oil price environment and an improved financial situation, our overarching goal for the next few years is to return to pre-pandemic production levels and then invest at a pace that will sustain or modestly grow those production volumes.  Our capital program for 2022 will be approximately $1.6 billion, a slight increase from our prior view. This includes some small changes to the timing of the rig count increases in Egypt and in the U.S. as well as an updated view of inflation. This amount also includes $200 million for exploration and appraisal activities, mostly in Suriname. In 2023 and 2024, capital increases a little further despite a mostly unchanged activity set as we expect continued inflationary pressures. Over the 3-year period, we're planning on an aggregate capital investment of around $5 billion. Based on this planned level of capital activity, we should exit 2024 at production levels similar to 2019 after adjusting 2019 for divestments. Most of the growth will come from Egypt, with some modest improvement in the U.S. and declining volumes in the North Sea. At current strip pricing, we expect to generate approximately $6.5 billion of free cash flow over the next 3 years. By any measure, this is a strong free cash flow yield relative to market cap or enterprise value and it would be even stronger, if not for the heavily backwardated strip pricing. I would remind everyone that these numbers assume no production volumes from Suriname but do include continued capital investment for exploration and appraisal. If we FID any discoveries on Block 58 during the next 3 years, planned CapEx would increase modestly since 75% of our appraisal and development spend will be funded by our partner. Additionally, this outlook does take into account the pending Delaware Basin minerals package sale, but assumes no further portfolio changes. Finally, our commitment to return capital to shareholders over the next 3 years will remain unchanged. We will return a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Before turning the call over to Steve, I'd like to wrap up with a few remarks about our ESG goals and initiatives. We have established several rigorous goals for 2022, which are designed to move the ESG needle as quickly as possible. We remain focused on our key pillars of air, water and communities and people.  Our short-term incentive compensation plan for 2022 includes 3 specific ESG-related goals. We will reduce upstream routine flaring in Egypt by 40%. We will initiate new programs to promote and deliver increased supplier diversity, and we will implement a new workplace ecosystem that recognizes the changing dynamics of technology and work schedules for our employees. We have also established rigorous new safety compliance protocols and metrics as we pursue continuous improvement in the health and well-being of our workforce and for the communities in which we operate. As we look to the longer term, we will invest a minimum of $100 million over the next 3 years in ESG initiatives, much of which will be focused on global emissions reductions programs. To underscore our commitment to these efforts, for the first time, we have added an emissions-related goal to our long-term incentive compensation plan. By the end of 2024, our goal is to deliver emissions-focused projects that eliminate at least 1 million tons of CO2 emissions per year. To provide added transparency, we plan to have these projects and their associated CO2 reductions externally verified.  And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney.
Stephen Riney: Thank you, John. So let me start with further details related to our fourth quarter results. As noted in our news release yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported fourth quarter 2021 consolidated net income of $382 million or $1.05 per diluted common share. These results include several items that are outside of APA's core earnings, the largest of which was associated with noncash impairments, primarily on Altus Midstream's interest in the EPIC Crude Pipeline. Net of tax and noncontrolling interest, this reduced APA earnings by $123 million. The partial reversal of prior tax valuation allowances and other tax adjustments had a $42 million benefit to earnings. Please see our detailed table of non-GAAP financial measures in our financial and operations supplement for a full reconciliation of adjusted earnings. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $468 million or $1.29 per diluted common share. Lease operating expense in the quarter was above guidance as a result of increasing inflationary pressures and higher-than-expected emissions costs in the North Sea.  In the U.K., the price of emission credits has nearly doubled since credit auctions were initiated in May of 2021. G&A expense was also significantly above guidance, primarily due to the fourth quarter strength in our stock price and the resulting impact on noncash stock-related compensation expense. Costs were also impacted by a higher-than-planned incremental incentive compensation accrual in the quarter. Due to these higher costs as well as lower oil, gas and NGL prices in November and December, free cash flow for the quarter was $485 million below our guidance of $600 million, which we provided in early November. As John noted, the modernized production sharing contract in Egypt was ratified in late December. If you haven't already done so, please refer to the Egypt PSC Modernization Investor Presentation on our website for more details related to the updated terms and their anticipated impacts.  The new agreement became effective on April 1, 2021. From that date to the end of 2021, the true-up of revenue sharing net of some small closing-related costs was $245 million benefit to the APA, Sinopec joint venture. The agreement also included a signature bonus payable to EGPC of $100 million, half of the signature bonus was payable upon signing and was offset against outstanding receivables. The other half of the signature bonus is payable to EGPC over the next 5 years. Given the timing of the PSC signing late in December, our fourth quarter operational results include no impact from the PSC modernization. Turning to Altus Midstream. The business combination with EagleClaw Midstream is expected to close shortly. As a result, fourth quarter 2021 should be the final quarter for APA to consolidate Altus Midstream's balance sheet. This will eliminate the consolidation of approximately $1.4 billion of Altus' debt and redeemable preferred equity. Depending on how you model them, this could have a significant impact on APA debt metrics and multiples related to enterprise value. Now I would like to turn to the outlook for 2022. We are planning for a capital program of around $1.6 billion with $1.4 billion in development capital and $200 million of exploration and appraisal, mostly in Suriname. This level of activity should deliver company-wide annual adjusted production similar to that of 2021.  In Egypt, increased drilling activity in 2021 has already halted the decline in gross production volumes. With more drilling activity being added in 2022, gross production will turn to a growth trajectory through the year and into 2023. On an adjusted basis, you will see an immediate uplift in production in the first quarter given the revised terms of the modernized PSC. From that point, adjusted production should grow in line with gross production, excluding PSC-related impacts from changes in Brent oil price.  In the North Sea, we anticipate a similar production level compared to 2021 as we will again have another lengthy turnaround season at Beryl. Additionally, the Ocean Patriot drilling rig is expected to be offline for approximately 3 months to repair damage incurred to its anchor system during a recent weather event. Production volumes in 2022 will be impacted by the reduced amount of rig activity. In the U.S., average production this year will be modestly below 2021 after adjusting for asset sales. However, we will exit 2022 in a position of sustaining to slightly growing U.S. production. There are 3 reasons for the decline compared to 2021. First, about 7,000 BOE per day of production is lost due to the Delaware minerals package sale that John mentioned earlier. Second, the DUC program largely completed in the first half of 2021 provided a significant production boost that will not be replicated in 2022. Finally, the underlying drilling program in the U.S. will only get to a maintenance level of activity around midyear after we have added the fourth drilling rig. On the cost side, inflationary pressures are real in our sector, and we are seeing that across many forms of cost. In particular, LOE is rising with everything from labor and trucking to fuels and chemicals under pressure. Our guidance for 2022 costs include these impacts. That said, we see risks of further pressures on these and other costs as we look to 2022 and beyond, especially if the current price environment prevails. All of the details around our 2022 full year and first quarter guidance can be found in our quarterly supplement on our website. Our 2022 guidance around certain costs may be difficult to reconcile to 2021 actuals due to the impact of the Altus deconsolidation. Please reach out to Gary and his team for further support. From a free cash flow perspective, 2022 looks very robust. At current strip prices, we anticipate free cash flow well in excess of $2 billion. In addition to strong cash flow from operations, we also expect $805 million in cash proceeds from the Delaware Basin mineral rights sale, and we anticipate a sell-down of up to 4 million shares of our ownership in Altus Midstream during the 3-month period following the closing of its combination with EagleClaw. All of that should provide a significant amount of available cash in the next few months. First priority for that cash will be to pay off the revolver. Beyond that, remaining available cash will be used in some combination to buy back shares, further reduce debt and to fund the dividend. I would note that in January we utilized the early call option feature on the $214 million of bonds that mature in April. So that debt effectively sits on the revolver today. Finally, I'd like to make a few remarks about steps taken on our new capital returns framework. In the fourth quarter, we returned well in excess of 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders, mostly through stock buybacks. We had to fund a portion of this on our revolver and had the confidence to do so given the robust price environment coupled with our expectation of significant near-term divestment proceeds.  Obviously, we cannot repurchase shares this aggressively every quarter, but we feel it was a good decision at that time. While relative valuation for APA has improved, we continue to believe our stock is a good value on both a relative and absolute basis. We are committed to our capital returns framework, so the share buybacks will continue in 2022.  And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Doug Leggate: John, I wonder if I could ask you first on Suriname. Obviously, Krabdagu was announced before your earnings. When you and I last spoke, I guess, at our conference in November and multiple times since then, it seems to me that Krabdagu was kind of a gating item for -- not to put words in your mouth but what if there will be a Board or what the size of the Board will be. So I'm just wondering if you could give us an update on your thoughts there because it seems to me at least that the press release was somewhat right down the middle. What are you -- is there anything concern you here? Can you talk about was this multiple sands? Is there a flow test gating item you want to get past? What are you thinking? Maybe just frame for us what you think the next steps are?
John Christmann: Thanks for the question. I mean, first of all, we made it clear that Krabdagu was the next well we needed to drill. It was technically an exploration well but it was a well we had fairly high confidence in because we're really starting to get an understanding of what is working and what we can image and so forth. So I think coming in and finding 90 meters of light oil pay and good quality rock which is predominantly just -- we did only drill down through the Campanian is a fantastic outcome. I mean we're very excited about it. We're gaining confidence on what's working. I think the key next step here is because it is an exploration well, is moving on to the flow test and the pressure build-ups and the beauty of this is, is we can do that now, and we are anxious to get on with it. So I think we just need time to confirm and get some more information. And then obviously, we'll be back to you with a lot more color once we validated that.
Doug Leggate: You still see Sapakara Keskesi Krabdagu as a combination development?
John Christmann: I mean the nice thing is at Sapakara South and in my prepared remarks, we stated that the connected volume to the Sapakara South-1 well has increased, and it's a good sign because with time and the build-up, things like -- fields get bigger and so forth. And so that has happened there. There is more appraisal to do at Sapakara South. The nice thing is with where it is connected or the distance, it could be connected. But I won't say that it has to be connected. So there's a lot of optionality there. We need to do the flow test at Krabdagu and then we'll come back to the game plan. And the nice thing is, while we're doing the flow test, there's optionality with where we send the rig next. Do we go ahead and appraise Krabdagu? Do we appraise the second well at Sapakara South1? Or there's also some nice-looking prospects in between here that we have confidence in. So there's a lot of optionality, Doug here, a lot to work with, and we just need time to collect more data and keep working the data.
Doug Leggate: Okay. My follow-up, hopefully, a quick one, Steve. On the last call, you talked about a strip pricing before the modernization of Egypt, the PSC, more than $2 billion of free cash flow in 2022. And I guess that was back in the third quarter call. You've put out the same number today, which I think might be 1 of the reasons your stock is lagging. So can you walk us through what -- why is that number not been reset higher. And again, usual question for me. What do you think the duration of the free cash flow capacity of the portfolio is today?
Stephen Riney: Yes, Doug. So I think I'd probably refer to the -- I think we put out a chart in our supplement that will give you a good view to the 3 years, and that will I think answer the last question you had there around the duration of cash flows and what should be happening to production volume and what that cash flow looks like under, I wouldn't say, a current strip, the February 7 strip, which we're above today and then an $86 flat WTI price environment, which was the '22 strip on that February 7 date. You can see in my script, I said it will be more than $2 billion of free cash flow. You can see from the chart, it's closer to around $2.2 billion. What would be any difference in that versus maybe some expectations, I'm not sure what the strip price environment was when I said it would be $2 billion. We can go back and maybe reconcile that. But I think, number one, we've divested the minerals package. So that's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million of cash flow that will come out of 2022 on a free cash flow basis. We're also using the 2 -- the February 7 strip, which is a little bit below where we are actually today. And again, I'm not sure exactly how that compares to the strip I used last time and the costs that we talked about, John and I both talked about what's going on with cost environment. You see it in some of the assumptions that we've made in our guidance which is also in our supplement around LOE going up, G&A going up, and we can talk about some of those things, if you'd like. So costs are going up. and it's also affecting the capital program. So we -- and I noted in my comments that we've built some inflation into the capital program, and that's why it's a little bit higher. Part of the reason why it's a little bit higher now than what we were talking about back in November. So I think it's a number of things that kind of accumulate there. Some of those are probably maybe us being a little bit conservative, especially on the cost side as we have built a reasonable amount of inflation into here. We're not saying that it's inappropriate, especially in this price environment, but costs are kind of moving quickly these days. And we just wanted to make sure that we've built an appropriate view into the plan at this point. And so we'll continue to monitor this as we go through the year.
Doug Leggate: Okay. I'll let someone ask about the use of proceeds.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Freeman with Raymond James.
John Freeman: The first question I had, I guess, piggybacking on Doug's questions related to Suriname. So the $200 million of -- roughly $200 million of capital rose from maybe not Suriname but close enough. $200 million that's allocated towards Suriname. It seems like maybe in the comments, John, you haven't necessarily decided the exact mix of the plan this year in terms of what's going to be appraisal versus exploration. So is the $200 million roughly, I don't know, sort of a conservative kind of placeholder until you have a better idea of the mix of appraisal versus exploration because obviously, what you're on the hook for is quite a bit different if it's exploration versus appraisal.
John Christmann: No, John, it's a great question. I think we've got some optionality and flexibility in there. And I think we've tried to just conservatively handle the $200 million out of covered, both between Block 53 and 58, right? So I think it's a good estimate. And there's very important to a well or 2 to swing either way.
John Freeman: Okay. Yes. I just look like last year. You ended up coming in a good bit below the initial budget you'll put out on Suriname last year. So that's what I ask.  And then the other question related to the mineral sales. So last quarter, you all said you were targeting in 2022 $500 million of noncore U.S. sales that were mainly going to come out of the Permian. Is this 805 -- the divestiture you did on the minerals should we think of this as just that's -- that was in addition to whatever you were contemplating. I think previously, you all kind of contemplated additional deals in the Central Basin Platform. So just trying to get an idea of how to think about the minerals deal you all did that was a good bit more on proceeds than what you all contemplated doing for all of '22?
John Christmann: No. I would just say, John, we said we'd sell a minimum of $500 million. Clearly, we've met that through the sale. But as I said in my prepared remarks, there's still opportunity out there for some potential additional pruning if we choose to do so. But I mean, we view it as we've met that goal and we've exceeded that goal.
Operator: Next question comes from Michael Scialla with Stifel.
Michael Scialla: I want to follow up on Suriname as well. You said the discovery derisks some additional prospects. So is Krabdagu a different play type than the prior 4 discoveries? And thinking in particular, are you feeling like you're able to identify black oil versus higher GOR prospects at this point? Just looking for more color there.
John Christmann: Mike, it's a great question. And even with your background, I think you probably have some insights into what we're getting a handle with. But I think from the geophysical side and the geologic model side, it's derisking and becoming a lot more predictive, which gives us confidence. And it's the same play type. I mean we're in Maastrichtian and Campanian. We did not drill on down to the San Antonio in here. So this was really just the upper 2 targets. But I think it's just confidence in what we're being able to see an image and put into the models. So it's a positive from that perspective.
Michael Scialla: Very good. I wanted to see, Steve, you mentioned, I think, previously that you plan to retire another $337 million of long-term debt this year at par. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, but I missed it. There may be some plans to go beyond that. Anything you can talk about there?
Stephen Riney: Yes. So the $337 million is a combination of the April '22 bonds and the January of '23 bonds. And both of those -- the April '22 bonds were called early in January of this year. And as I said in my prepared remarks, that $214 million of debt sits on the revolver effectively today. And the remaining amount, which is the January maturities, we will call those in the fourth quarter of this year at par. They just have a 3-month early call option. That's all. And we generally exercise that. So we'll pay down at least those amounts of debt. And again, what I said in the -- in my prepared remarks is that we will -- with the cash coming in, in the first quarter, we will pay down the revolver, which at the end of last year, the revolver had $542 million on it. And again, we did add that $215 million -- $214 million from the April maturities to that. So there have been some other ins and outs on the revolver during the quarter, but the revolver will end the quarter at zero. So that will be the first use of cash.  At the end of the quarter or through the quarter, I should say, we -- between the operating free cash flow, the royalty package sale, which we should close before the quarter ends. If you exclude any sale of Altus shares during the quarter, if you use all of that cash from operating cash flow and the royalty package sale to pay off the revolver, you'd still be left over somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 million to $600 million of cash, which we may have already or may use to buy back shares or repurchase other debt further reduced debt. And we'll talk about what we've chosen to do with any excess cash with each quarterly results instead of getting into a process of just ad hoc conversations whenever we're on conference calls or anything like that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles Meade: I wanted to go back to the Sapakara South1. So obviously, that's a positive result from the flow test, 400 million barrels in place. But should what should we be thinking about in terms of recoverable there? And can you frame or refresh for us? I know this is maybe overly simplistic. But what do you need to get to in terms of total recoverable resources before you're within striking distance across the finish line on FID.
John Christmann: Well, a couple of different questions there, Charles, and I'll give a little bit of insight, and then I'll let Dave Pursell jump in here as well. But I think the things to know on Sapakara South. Number one, 1 continue -- kind of contiguous thick blocky sand; 1.4 Darcy rock. So you're going to have very efficient reservoir and high recovery. And then the second thing is with one of the keys after you do a flow test is you collect the data on the build-up and the characteristics there. And it's from most characteristics of the build-up that really showed us and demonstrated that there's even more resource there than we had mapped in Sapakara South. So it points you to more appraisal, and it's a really good sign. So Dave, I'll let you jump in on the second part of that question.
David Pursell: Yes. Thanks, John. Charles, good question. John is right on the build-up test. Remember those -- that we floated for a few days and then shut in for a long-term build-up and the longer -- that longer-dated pressure really allows us to start to hone in on recoverable volumes, and that's where the original range of that initial range of 325 to 375 that's moving higher as we continue to analyze the longer shut-in data. On recovery factor, again, that's going to be a function of what the development scheme looks like if we get there. But in 1.4 Darcy Rock that's world-class reservoir. It's 1.4 Darcy, as John pointed out, it's thick and blocky to any range of recovery factors that you might be using, you want to look at the high end of that range because this is some of the best rock you'll see. So we're very comfortable and excited about what kind of recoveries we could get, it's just too premature to throw a number out there.
Charles Meade: And Dave, any comment or just kind of a guidepost on what to think about as far as recoverable to meet the FID threshold?
David Pursell: It's a good question. I suspect other folks will try to ask that. We'll work with our partner to try to get to development, and there's a number of factors, including recoverable resource that factor into that. So I'll just leave it there.
Charles Meade: Got it. Yes, I know it's a simple way to ask on a complex some. But 1 other question on the Delaware Basin mineral sale. Was that a piece of -- or was that a piece of that original BP acquisition -- BP Permian acquisition that's where those assets came from?
John Christmann: Some of it came from that, Charles. It's just a Delaware Basin package, and there's a few different pieces of it that came in there, but some of that was part of the old [indiscernible] BP.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.
Bob Brackett: A 2 parter. One is, I think in the verbal comments I heard light oil at Krabdagu versus not seeing that in the press release. Could you kind of confirm the quality of the oil?
John Christmann: Yes, Bob, it's a great question. It's early. We've got samples and they're on their way to lab. But we can confirm it's light oil in all 90 meters of pay that we released.
Bob Brackett: Perfect. And the second 1 might be a bit pick and knits, but you've mentioned in the release and in your words a minute ago, the world-class reservoir quality sitting there at Sapakara South1. And I think the language in the release on the reservoir quality of Krabdagu was middle of the fairway. Anything there? Or is that just you're being vague until you actually get core sample and get some real measurements?
David Pursell: Yes, Bob, this is Dave Pursell. We want to see the flow test. I think before we flow tested Sapakara, we were probably using the same language. We want to see the data and whether it's the core data and/or the flow test. We're going to wait to see what the results are from those before we get out of the fairway on that.
Bob Brackett: Perfect. I'll stop asking lawyerly questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.
Jeanine Wai: Maybe our first question is just on cash returns, our favourite subject. In your prepared remarks, John or Steve, I think you mentioned a progressively larger dividend. And I think also your prior commentary on that was that your base dividend needs to be just meaningfully higher on a yield basis versus the S&P. So we're just wondering how you're thinking about where the base dividend can grow, whether it's a yield or some of your peers have, for example, a cap on the post-breakeven dividend or they have like a maximum percentage of CFO that the base dividend will be at some mid-single price?
John Christmann: Yes. Jeanine, and I can let Steve jump in here as well. But I think in general, just over the 3-year period, we are laying out with the amount of free cash flow that we're going to generate, you could see us progressively increase that dividend. I think we're a believer in, want as much in the base dividend. And today, by our actions you've seen, we've had a desire to buy back more shares because of where we trade on a free cash flow yield. But I think we're just laying a framework there that over time, we do anticipate we will be able to raise the dividend Steve, anything you want to add?
Stephen Riney: Yes. I think. And we've said this in the past here in the recent past, Jeanine. I think the best thing for APA to be doing right now is buybacks, leaning into the buybacks with any excess cash flow because of the discount that we still see ourselves trading at. That said, I think the base dividend needs to be competitive. It needs to be competitive not just with our peers but with the broader market. We recognize that. And I think that means in the long term, in our sector, dividend yields need to go higher than where they are today, which averages somewhere in the neighborhood of 2%.  As a perspective, if you take our 60% capital returns framework, if that was all in dividends, we'd be yielding in excess of 10% on our dividend today. But we're not paying that all-in dividends. It is in buybacks -- a lot of it in buybacks, the vast majority in buybacks. And John spoke a little bit in his prepared remarks about what would cause us to raise the base dividend. And I think the most important thing around the base dividend and improving that and increasing that over time is that we want to be confident that that's resilient. We've commented before on the amount of pain that we endured when we cut the dividend by 90% in early 2020, anticipating what was ahead of us at that point in time. And so we want that dividend to be resilient when we raise it.  But really, the things that are going to raise the dividend is some sustained improvement in relative share trading, some more strengthening of the balance sheet and possibly not required, but possibly a less volatile price environment than we've endured over the last few years. And really, any combination of those types of things are going to give you the confidence to be able to raise the dividend and do so and feel like it's going to be resilient through time. And so that's our approach to the dividend. We definitely need to raise it, and we will do that over time.
Jeanine Wai: Okay. Great. Our second question is just maybe heading back to the 3-year outlook, which we appreciate you all given us. Can we maybe dig in a little bit more on some of the assumptions? For example, I think you clarified. Can you just clarify whether the plan is only valid at certain price outlook? We know you showed free cash flow estimates at the strip and higher. You also mentioned that inflation was built into the outlook. So maybe any commentary on what level of inflation you've assumed along with anything on U.S. cash taxes.
John Christmann: Jeanine, I think in general, we've set the activity levels and have confidence in those. We've been planning around those. And I think that's why there's a lot of confidence in this year's plan. In terms of inflation, we're seeing more right now probably in the U.S. than we are in the international market. But those would be the 2 factors. But I think we've got a lot of confidence in the plan. It's a relatively stable plan over the next 3 years, and we are going to be growing oil, I think, at about 5%, driven primarily by Egypt.
Stephen Riney: Yes. And just a little further color on that. I think the capital program is robust through a pretty wide price range. If prices go up, the capital -- the activity set isn't going to change from what we have planned. The cost of that activity could possibly go up with some further inflation if we found ourselves in a much higher price environment. But it's also a robust activity set even in a lower price environment. And as a matter of fact, I think it's probably a robust program all the way down to $50 WTI because it's the sustaining capital program that we want to have in place. And we can certainly afford that and still be generating free cash flow even below -- well below $50 WTI.  So we'll stay with the capital program, and that is a good one and a robust one and won't move with pretty broad movements in price. The tax question that you had, we do not anticipate paying -- being a U.S. cash taxpayer for quite some time. If we found ourselves in an extremely high price environment for a few years, we could. We have 2 forms of tax loss carry forwards, but we have multiple forms. But the 2 big ones are what you would call grandfathered tax losses that are that can be used 100% to offset taxable income. And then we have some other tax losses that are not grandfathered under the recent tax changes and would be subject to an 80% limit that could be used to offset up to 80% of taxable income. And so when you get into -- you go through the first the grandfathered losses first and when you get into the non-grandfathered loss, you could find yourselves in a situation where you'd be paying taxes on 20% of your taxable income, but that would be quite some time at the current price environment that we're in.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.
Neal Dingmann: My first question is on the, John, really just on the ease of activity. You all have laid out nice plans to increase the rig count. It's about 15% by midyear this year given the high economics of the place. So I'm just wondering when you look on a go forward, what are the limiting factors on how much further you could push the activity of this play? Just wanted obviously given the great economics there.
John Christmann: No, Neal, you're spot on to kind of what the plan is. We're currently at 12 rigs today. I think we had the 13th rig next month, and then we'll be at 15 midyear. We think that's a good place. I think one of the keys with Egypt is while we were working the modernization, we've been building inventory and putting together a pretty robust drilling line. So we're excited about the program there. I just was over in Egypt, and I can tell you, Egypt is excited about it as well. And we've got a lot of work to do in terms of merging the concessions and the JVs while executing but we're off to a good start and a lot of momentum and a lot of anticipation. We're excited about it.
Neal Dingmann: I'd say really look forward to activity there. And then secondly, just on domestic pressures, I notice you've continued to mention even on this call, the domestic OFS inflation along with some difficulty, maybe procuring pipe and other equipment. I'm just wondering do you see the same challenges on this. I'm just wondering how much long do you think this to go forward? Or do you anticipate this mitigating a bit in the coming quarters?
John Christmann: No. I mean I think the key with us is in the luxury we've had is we set our activity sets and we plan those. I mean we've been planning to add the fourth rig in the U.S. since last fall. And so I think we've got good line of sight on our services and activities. Supply chain is working several quarters out, and we find ourselves in a pretty good place. But I also say it takes time, right? I mean that fourth rig will come in midyear, and we couldn't have added it any sooner in the U.S.  So it just takes a lot of rigor and a lot of planning and a lot of stability in the activity sets. And I think that's where we've landed everything in a place where we've got a lot of confidence around those. But let's not kid ourselves, there are pressures in the system. Truck drivers out in West Texas. Chemicals, fuel, there are pressures in the system and steel and everything else that's going up, especially on some of our longer-dated things.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup.
Scott Gruber: Circling back on the balance sheet, I may have missed this, but is there a leverage target at some normalized crude price that you'll target over the medium-to-longer term, gross debt level that you'll target over the medium term post the Altus deconsolidation? How are you guys thinking about targets for the balance sheet from here?
Stephen Riney: Yes. We don't have a specific target in mind. We have -- what we have in mind is getting back to investment grade. And while that's important, it's not urgent that we get it done right away. It is important that we get that done now. And so we don't have any specific target for long-term debt. In the end, it's -- the rating agencies will decide what level of long-term debt, what type of debt-to-EBITDA metrics would allow us to get back to investment grade. And so we're targeting whatever it takes to get back to investment grade. I think it's probably going to require a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1 or below, especially in this price environment. We've made pretty good progress on that in 2021. We're going to make more progress on that in 2022. If we do -- if we pay down no more debt this year other than what we have planned and the debt that's sitting on the revolver at the end of '21, if we use all remaining free cash flow for share buybacks we would end the year at the current strip with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.1. So we're getting into the right ballpark and we'll see what the rating agencies will do with that.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And then just a quick 1 on Alpine High. The 4 million share early sell-down option associated with Altus EagleClaw combo, I believe it came with the stipulation that you invest the first $75 million in new Alpine High development activities over the subsequent 18 months. Is that spend in the budget for '22? And can you talk about the plan for Alpine High at these commodity prices within the multiyear plan?
David Pursell: Yes, Scott, this is Dave Pursell. Yes, that's -- it's in the budget. We have the fourth rig in the U.S. We're adding. Think about that as a Delaware Basin focused rigs. It will do some drilling in Alpine and also do some drilling at our DXL field, which flows into the Altus Midstream assets. And so there's a -- it will move around in the basin over the next couple of years. But it will do a fair amount of drilling at Alpine specific.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng: Just curious that can you talk about that, the CapEx how that is going to spread throughout the quarters? Are they going to be pretty ratable or that 1 particular quarter is going to be heavier than usual?
John Christmann: No. I mean I think you've got a little gradual build in the schedules with the Egypt rigs ramping. By midyear, we'll be at 15, we're at 12 now. We're going to add a rig in the Permian midyear, so it'll be a little bit heavier back half. And then the only shift you've got right now is with the Ocean Patriot needing to go in for some repairs that were addressed in the prepared remarks. But beyond that, nothing -- it's going to be pretty steady given the way we've geared our program.
Paul Cheng: Yes. And the second question is that, I think previously, when you guys use complete PSC modernization, talking about this year will be a mid-teen type of growth in the oil production. If we're looking at 2023 and forward, with a 15-rig program, what kind of growth that you would be able to generate over there on the [indiscernible] basis?
John Christmann: Egypt is going to drive the primary growth in the portfolio of oil over the next 3 years. And so I think we've outlined approximately 5% for Apache total to get us back to kind of the pre-COVID levels. And Egypt is going to be the driver. So that's probably going to put that more in the 10% range.
Paul Cheng: Okay. And that I just curious that is that extend, I presume that more than 2024. So if we look a bit longer term, is that 10% is kind of target for you guys or --
John Christmann: I mean we really just laid out, Paul, a 3-year look on that. But clearly, the plan is to continue investing at the same rate or potentially higher in Egypt as we move on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.
Scott Hanold: I'm just kind of curious on maybe following up that question from Paul. Like when I look at the chart on Page 9 of the outlook through 2024, you do have a nice step-up in oil '21, '22 and '23. But '23, '24 looks a little flatter with gas going up a lot more. Can you give us a sense of the dynamic around there because I know the Qasr field in Egypt is on probably a pretty good decline at this point? So like where does the gas pick up in '23 and '24 in your outlook?
John Christmann: Yes, Dave, are you --
David Pursell: Yes. I think if you look at the portfolio wide, the growth in Egypt is going to be really driven by oil. There will be obviously gas growth as well, but it will be oil. The gas growth in the portfolio will likely come from the Delaware Basin and Alpine.
Scott Hanold: Okay. So it's more of Alpine High, great. Okay. And then as my follow-up, turning to the Permian and ex-Alpine High. Can you give us a sense of where you think your depth of your core Tier 1 inventory is so when you think about your outlook over the 3 years and maybe a little beyond what kind of depth do you see there at a, say, 3 to 4-rig cadence.
David Pursell: Yes, we're well beyond the 3-year program. We get out towards the end of the decade easily.
Scott Hanold: Okay. And is that sort of Delaware or Midland? Or just kind of a combination of both?
David Pursell: It's a combination of both, Scott. It will -- our SMB program has been the driver, and that's where we'd see the core, but we're adding an extra rig into the Delaware because we have confidence that we have longer-term inventory there as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc.
Leo Mariani: I wanted to ask a little bit on the North Sea here. I know that you clearly have been plagued with some unplanned downtime. And of course, you have turnarounds in that area. But as I'm just looking at the production, you guys were around 62,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter of '20. It looks like it's down about 30% to the fourth quarter of '21. It sounds like a lot of that was maintenance downtime related. I just wanted to get a sense. You have a comment in here that you can get back close to 50,000 by the end of 2022. In terms of how you view that asset. Do you see that 50 is kind of being little bit more stable in that outlook? Or do you see the 50 probably continuing to trend down? And is it just kind of always anticipation of that kind of 2-rig program in the North Sea?
John Christmann: No, it's a good observation. I mean I think the key with the North Sea when you look at -- we've got 2 different assets there, Forties and Beryl. And Forties, we've got the Ocean Patriot up there. We're working. We're doing subsea tiebacks. We've had that rig working for a long time. And we did have 2 rig breakdowns that we typically haven't seen that have just kind of slid the schedule back. One was some things with the BOP. And then as we mentioned, this had some really rough weather and had 1 of the anchors break on one of the tie down lines, and we've still got to get that rig into the shipyard to have that repaired. So when you're running 1 floater and then you have something like this, which is kind of a very unusual event, it slides back a key well like Garten 4, which was scheduled to come on until the back half of this year. So I mean, I think we have confidence in getting back to the 50. But if you look at Forties and how we're starting to operate it, we've got 1 platform rig. We've been working between Beryl and Forties. We're definitely starting to move into the wind down in terms of how we look at Forties from a capital investment perspective. And we will be kind of modifying how we're going to operate that. We've historically run a drilling campaign, and we won't be doing that in the future. When we bought that asset from BP in 2003, it was scheduled to be abandoned in 2012. Here, we are a decade later, we see that still being another decade from now, but we will be starting to think about the twilight years on Forties as opposed to investing capital in Beryl and continuing to expand and adding subsea tiebacks.
Leo Mariani: Okay. Very helpful color for sure. And maybe just jumping over to Suriname here. So I think there was a point in time where all maybe talked about kind of a 2-rig program on Block 58. But it seems like maybe it's just -- it's kind of gone to 1 rig. Has there just been any shift in the thinking of the partnership here in terms of how you view the asset or maybe you just think it's a little better to go a little slower, kind of still early in the appraisal program and if you guys have continued success appraising and you get to FID, do you envision this as maybe going back to a couple of rigs as you look out in the 3-year plan?
John Christmann: Yes. I think it's a function of equipment and timing. There were -- Total brought in 2 rigs. The developer was scheduled to leave and it did leave. We still got the Valiant. I think if you read some of their comments that committed to drilling 3 more wells this year in Block 58. And that would imply that there's probably more activity needed to get that accomplished. But we've got options on the rig that's coming, the Gerry de Souza that's coming to Block 53. We've got additional options there. So there's some flexibility in terms of how we approach it.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to John Christmann for closing remarks.
John Christmann: Thank you, operator. I'd like to close with the following comments. We've outlined a 3-year overview based on a heavily backwardated strip that delivers much stronger production and free cash flow than currently modeled by the Street. With $6.5 billion of projected free cash flow, we will return $4 billion to shareholders under our current framework that leaves $2.5 billion for debt reduction or additional shareholder returns through buybacks and/or dividend increases. Clearly, we will make material returns to shareholders, and we will continue to strengthen the balance sheet. Lastly, we are very pleased with how Suriname is progressing and look forward to the data that is coming from the flow test at Krabdagu.  Operator, back to you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day. Thank you for standing by and welcome to the APA Corporation 's Third Quarter 2021 results conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours.
Gary Clark: Good morning. And thank you for joining us on APA Corporation Third Quarter 2021 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results in 2021 outlook. Also on the call and available to answer questions are Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development. Tracy Henderson, Senior Vice President of Exploration, and Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 18 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our 3rd quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor. apacop.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Our top priority coming into 2021 was to continue strengthening the balance sheet through debt reduction. With the significant recent strides in that regard and a favorable outlook for continued free cash flow generation, we are in a position today to announce some material changes at our capital investment plans and use of free cash flow. First, we're moving toward a capital budget that will sustain or slightly grow global production volumes. This is being accomplished through a gradual ramp in activity over the next few quarters primarily in Egypt where we are anticipating PSC modernization terms will be approved by year-end, but also in the onshore U.S. Second, we're committing to a significant increase in cash return to shareholders. While a stronger commodity price environment has accelerated progress on the Balance sheet is the quality and cash flow generating capacity of our core operating areas through a range of commodity price environments that are enabling our new capital return framework. We have a substantial inventory of quality drilling opportunities throughout our portfolio. In addition to Egypt, which now has the deepest inventory in more than a decade, we also have significant potential in our onshore U.S. portfolio. Primarily in the Southern Midland Basin, Alpine High, and Austin Chalk. In this price environment, there are many compelling drilling opportunities that should be funded and we anticipate adding a fourth onshore U.S. rig in 2022. With regard to our new capital return framework, we are committed to returning a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders. This begins with our base dividend, which in September we announced would increase to an annualized rate of $0.25 per share. Yesterday, we announced a doubling of that rate to $0.50 per share. In early October, we took the more significant step of initiating a share repurchase program. Through October 31st, we have repurchased 14.7 million shares and expect to continue returning capital in this manner through the Fourth Quarter and into 2022. Our commitment is to return at least 60% of free cash flow to shareholders and we will exceed this amount in the current quarter. We believe that, APA currently offers one of the highest free cash flow yields at our peer group. And that this framework could deliver us an attractive and highly competitive return to our shareholders. Turning now to the third quarter results of highlights. Through a combination of strong commodity prices, capital and cost discipline and good well performance, we generated nearly $1.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA, making it our strongest quarter of the year thus far. We anticipate fourth-quarter will be even stronger. U.S. production exceeded guidance in the Third Quarter and we continue to see good performance in the Permian oil plays, Alpine High, and the Austin Chalk. Internationally, production was a bit below guidance as we experienced some extended maintenance turnarounds and compressor outages in the North Sea and lower volumes in Egypt associated with the impact of strengthening oil prices on our production sharing contracts. We expect gross production in both the UK and Egypt will increase in the Fourth Quarter. In the U.S. we placed a total of 10 wells online during the quarter. This included 9 wells in the southern Midland Basin, 3 of which were 3 miles in length. At Alpine High no new wells were placed on production during the quarter. But performance from this year's DUC completions, as well as the underlying base production volumes continue to exceed expectations. In the East Texas Austin Chalk, we drilled three operated wells earlier this year, two of which are on production. We've recently added a third rig in the U.S., which will be used to continue the delineation of our Austin Chalk acreage position. We have now gathered a substantial amount of data in this play that indicates returns will compete with other quality portfolio opportunities. Dave Pursell can provide more details around the Austin Chalk during the Q&A. Turning to international operations. In Egypt, gross production has began to turn higher, putting us on a good trajectory as we enter 2022. In anticipation of modernized PSC terms, we recently increased our rig count to 11. We will likely add more rigs in 2022 as modernized terms would return Egypt to being the most attractive investment opportunity within our portfolio. In the North Sea, we continue to operate 1 floating rig in 1 platform crude. As expected, production was up modestly in the third quarter compared to the second quarter as we continued to work through both planned and unplanned maintenance downtime. On the drilling front, we recently TD the store to development well, which we plan to place online in January. While one of the primary objectives in this well was wet, we encountered more than 300 feet of net pay and other targets, which we're projecting we'll IP around 20 million cubic feet per day of gas and 2500 barrels per day of condensate. Our 59% working interest in this well provides good leverage to what should be robust North Sea natural gas and condensate prices over the coming months. In Block 58 offshore Surinam, our partner Total is currently running 2 rigs, one of which is conducting a flow test at Sahakara Sal and the other is drilling the Bond Bonnie exploration well in the Northern portion of the block. These operations are still ongoing and the data we collect will help inform the next steps in the Block 58 appraisal and exploration programs. On Block 53, we are finalizing plans for our next exploration well location with partners Petronas and Septa. The Noble Jerry D'souza drillship is scheduled to commence drilling this well in the First Quarter. The plan is to drill one well in Block 53 in 2022, but we have an option on the drillship for two additional wells if warranted. Before closing, I want to comment on the charge we took this quarter related to the Gulf of Mexico properties we sold to Fieldwood in 2013. Since Fieldwood emerged from bankruptcy in August, we have independently assess the situation and have elected to book the contingent liability that you saw in our press release. Steve will walk you through some of the details. In closing, I'd like to make a few remarks about the progress we're making on the ESG front. We recently announced that we have eliminated all routine flaring in U.S. operations. This was an ambitious goal that we set at the beginning of the year and achieved 3 months ahead of schedule. Additionally, through the end of the third quarter, flouring intensity in the U.S. was only.38%, significantly below our target of less than 1%. Our global safety performance has also been strong. We have delivered a 35% improvement in our total recordable incident rate compared to this time last year. We have also progressed a number of important initiatives that foster diversity and inclusion within the organization and that enhance the health and well-being of our employees. In October, we published our 2021 sustainability report, which I hope you will review for a more in-depth look at our ESG philosophy, performance, initiatives, and success stories. Finally, we are in the process of establishing some very rigorous short, medium and long-term ESG goals. Which will include further efforts on GHG and methane emissions and we look forward to discussing these in the near future. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on our third quarter results and outlook.
Stephen Riney : Thank you, John. In my prepared remarks this morning, I will make some additional comments on our third quarter performance. provide a bit more color on the field with related contingent liability, review aspects of ULTA's midstream's recently announced combination with EagleClaw and provide some more context around our free Cash Flow outlook and capital framework. As noted in our news release yesterday, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, APA Corporation reported a Third Quarter 2021 consolidated loss of $113 million or $0.30 per diluted common share. These results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings, excluding the impacts of the Fieldwood related contingent liability, a loss on extinguishment of debt, a charge for tax-related valuation allowance, and some other smaller items, adjusted net income for the Third Quarter was $372 million or $0.98 per share. Most of our financial results were in line with or better than guidance this quarter. Upstream capital investment was considerably below guidance, primarily due to the timing of infrastructure spending in Egypt and lower exploration costs in Suriname. Our teams have done a good job holding the line on capital and LOE despite service cost inflation. And we expect these will finish the year at or below our original 2021 guidance. G&A was also below guidance this quarter, mostly due to the timing of some costs which we now expect to be incurred in the fourth quarter. I would like to provide a bit more color now on the Fieldwood ARO situation. Through Fieldwood most recent bankruptcy process, we had to rely on third-party estimates of the remaining net abandonment obligations related to our legacy properties. Since Fieldwood emerged from bankruptcy in August, we have conducted our own evaluations. Based on that work, it appears the combination of the various financial security packages and the anticipated future net cash flows from the properties will not be sufficient to fund all of the remaining abandonment obligations. Accounting rules require that the entire undiscounted contingent obligation and the offsetting undiscounted value of the financial security will be brought onto our books. These are recorded independently as a liability and an asset without netting them against one another. Accordingly, in the Third Quarter, we brought onto our books the anticipated net ARO obligation of $1.2 billion. We also recorded the offsetting value of the financial security in the amount of $740 million. As a reminder, the financial security includes a funded abandonment trust, letters of credit, and surety bonds. As abandonment activity occurs, it will be funded first by the free cash flows currently being generated by the legacy properties. To the extent these cash flows are insufficient, Apache Corporation will be required to fund the activity and will be reimbursed through the financial security. Only after the operating cash flows and financial security packages are fully depleted, will Apache Corporation be obligated to fund the activity without a source of reimbursement. The undiscounted net liability is $446 million and we anticipate it will be at least 2026 before Apache incurs costs in excess of the available financial security. A few weeks ago, our majority on midstream Company, Ulta's, announced that it will combine with the parent Company of EagleClaw Midstream, to form the largest integrated midstream Company in the Delaware Basin. We considered a wide range of strategic options for Altice for more than a year. Ultimately, we determined that this transaction would allow all Altice shareholders to reposition equity holdings into a pro forma Company with the best combination of scale, synergies, asset quality, and attractive growth opportunities. The transaction would also preserve the $6 per share annual cash dividend for the public shareholders and provide near-term optionality for APA to monetize a meaningful portion of our current position. Such a secondary sale would benefit the combined Company by improving the public float. It would also provide APA with cash flow. A portion of which would be deployed into Alpine High activity, thereby enhancing dedicated sources of revenue for the Company. Reducing our ownership interest in Altice to a minority position provides a number of benefits for APA as well, including simplification of our financial reporting, increased comparability with our upstream only peers, and improved leverage metrics upon deconsolidation of $ 1.3 billion of debt and preferred equity as of September 30th. As we proceed towards closing, which is anticipated in the First Quarter of 2022, we will provide further detail around the accounting treatment and the financial statement impacts of this transaction. With respect to portfolio management more generally, as we build the capital investment program to a level capable of sustaining or slightly growing production, you will see increasing activity in our core asset areas, primarily in the U.S. onshore and in Egypt. This will demonstrate both the quality and running room in our core assets, as well as the need for a more accelerated pace of non-core asset divestments. As part of that, in 2022, we anticipate a minimum of $500 million of further non-core U.S. onshore asset divestments. I'd like to close by reiterating some of John's comments regarding APA's free Cash Flow generation capacity and it's anticipated uses. As always there can be some confusion around a term like free Cash Flow. So we want to be clear what it means at APA. You will find our definition of free Cash Flow in our financial and operational supplement, which we published with every quarterly earnings report. In the Fourth Quarter of this year at current strip pricing, we expect to generate free cash flow in excess of $600 million, which would result in full-year 2021 free cash flow of around $2 billion. Under our new capital return framework, a minimum of 60% of this free cash flow would go to ordinary dividends and share repurchases. And as John indicated, we expect to exceed this 60% framework in the current quarter. Looking ahead to next year, we currently contemplate a capital budget of around $1.5 billion. This would consist of roughly $1.3 billion for development and $200 million for exploration and appraisal activities, mostly in Suriname. As we've indicated, we believe the plan level of activity would put our global total BOE production on a sustaining to slightly growing long-term trajectory. This excludes any future production contribution from Suriname. The near-term allocation of capital would likely be bias to increasing oil production, which would offset declining gas and NGL production. That said, the commodity price environment is very active. And we have considerable flexibility within our portfolio to redirect capital as appropriate. Based on this investment level, we anticipate free Cash Flow in 2022 would again be in the neighborhood of $2 billion prior to any benefits of Egypt PSC modernization. Finally, I would like to caveat all of this with, as is customary, the final plan for 2022 will be reviewed in the Fourth Quarter call in February. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. You have your first question coming from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Doug Leggate : Well thanks. Good morning everybody. Just checking, John, can you hear me okay, I'm finding it difficult?
John Christmann: Yes, Good morning Doug.
Doug Leggate : Some companies can give me some problems. John, I'm going to start with Egypt if I may. I'm sure you saw the report we put out a month or so ago. One of your smaller peers has been a little bit more transparent on the potential changes in terms from the PSC modernization. So one of those conceptually, you could walk us through how are you see the moving parts as it relates to increased profit oil and in particular, the potential for legacy stranded capital cost recovery. If you could put some maybe a range of potential impacts on your assuming similar terms applied.
John Christmann: Well, Doug, it's a great question. And you know, from our perspective, we are the largest onshore producer in Egypt. You've hit on some of the key points. We've made the decision not to give more color on that until it's finalized. I will tell you that the modernized PSC has recently been approved by the cabinet and it has moved on to Parliament. So we're getting close and we expect it to everything's on track for a year end approval. But in terms of anymore color you've done a good piece of work out there. And I'll let Steve comment on a couple of things.
Stephen Riney : Yeah. Doug, the thing I would add to that, based on your work, you've demonstrated, you understand how the PSC's work. The backlog -- while we haven't indicated exactly how much that is, the mechanism to recover that, is that it is the backlog would be -- and we've shared this publicly already. The backlog would be recovered over a 5 year period on a quarterly basis. And that backlog would roll into the other costs for cost recovery. So it is all subject -- to sum of all of that, is subject to the 40% limit on cost recovery barrels. the benefit -- the real benefit as you've noted in your right out is that by aggregating all of these into a single bucket for cost recovery purposes, you don't end up with stranded costs in any of the smaller buckets and that will allow us to get this backlog of cost recovered as well especially in this price environment.
Doug Leggate : Steve, I know you don't want to give specifics, but end my -- my note I did suggest the potential of the impact could be several $100 million across would you push back on that or give some affirmation that we're in the ballpark?
Stephen Riney : Yeah, Doug. I think I need to be really careful about that. So I think we won't comment on it at this point in time.
Doug Leggate : Okay. I understand. Let me move on very quickly to my second question, which is understandably Suriname. You've got a well test, I guess you drilled out the fox about 3.5 weeks ago. John, I guess I'm a little surprised that you're not ready to give us some updates there or on Bonboni, where our guys on the ground are suggesting that you'd already in the formation era. So I'm just wondering if you can offer any color around those 2 pieces of potential news flow that we expect, I guess in the coming months, now we get there. Thank you.
John Christmann: Great question. I'll address Sahakara Sal South first. Number 1 you can appreciate that there's multiple phases of a flow test that you go through and sometimes even more important than the flow period is the buildup and the pressure response and all of those things. So it's early. I will just tell you save your question. I'm not in a position to reveal anything on it today, but hold your the question and we'll be able to respond in the near future. So is returned to Bonboni? Yes, there's Total's got two rigs, the developers of Sapakara South. The value in is at Bonboni I will remind everybody it's 45 kilometer step-out to the North, It is a key well. And I think the prospectivity up there will -- will inform the Northern portion of the block, as well as have some implications on Block 53. So once again, I'm not in a position to provide any update but I would just stay tuned, right? So and we'll be in a position to update you when we can.
Doug Leggate : Awesome, thanks so much, guys.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from Truist Securities. You may ask your question.
Neal Dingmann: Hello, John. Nice update on the shareholder return. I was just going to add one thing around that. Just your thought -- I don't know. Either you're the Company's for personal thoughts on something about doing more of a variable versus buyback. And obviously your stock appears to me on many levels quite cheap here. So I'm just wondering how you think about the two alternatives.
John Christmann: Neal, I guess I'll start out and just on the framework, I'll just give a few comments here. It really should not come as a surprise that anybody that's engaged with us over the last several years, when we've been on the road and in our meeting. Stephen and I have been really clear that a quality EMP needs to have a strong Balance Sheet. You need to have a sustaining the low growth profile. Multiple years of inventory, but not too many years of inventory. And we should be throwing off the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders. We've had a lot of work to do. The volatile pricing environment has at times impacted. But we're in a position where we're finally here. If you look at the framework, we believe you want to do a nice mix. You need a competitive dividend. We're not big fans of the variable dividend in terms of how that works. And I think with where our share price is, especially today is as cheap as it is, that that would be the primary means of how we'd look at it. Steve, any more specifics you want to provide?
Stephen Riney : Yeah. Only on the [Indiscernible] that. Thanks for the question because I think it is important to share some of the context around the framework that we've rolled out today. And I think John framed it exactly right in terms of the history of where we've been. I think if you just step back and think about the industry, it wasn't too long ago that the industry was all about growth and really, little or no returns to shareholders. More recently, we've finally gotten to where it's about moderated growth ambitions and really starting to roll out these returns frameworks. And I think the big step right now is to figure out well, what's the right return framework? And I'd say it's early days for the industry in general and we're all figuring that out now that returns frameworks right now are migrating towards a percent of free cash flow and I think that's probably good. Ranges out there pretty broad. I see ranges from 25% all the way up to 75%. We're probably going to find a sweet spot in there. And I think it's starting to migrate towards somewhere around 50% as an industry for APA specifically. I mean, we just took a significant step in improving the capital structure of the Company with the debt tender this fall and that was a 100% focused on debt reduction. We know there's more to do on the Balance Sheet and we'll get to that. But to be clear, we still want to get to investment-grade, that can take some time and that's okay. We do have to just recognize that, shareholders are pretty important too and we need to find a balance in returns to share holders, while at the same time continuing to improve the Balance Sheet. And the industry has chosen 50%, because they're kind of migrating towards that. We chose 60%. We think this is the right balance, or ACA. We have a quality diversified portfolio. It's exposed to a good range of commodity price and geographic mix. It's capable of sustaining free cash flow for many many years. And remember free cash flow, the basis for the return's circulation is after capital spending. We've been improving the Balance Sheet. We can still continue to strengthen the Balance Sheet up to 40%. Still available for other uses including debt reduction, but I'd say in the near-term, we certainly have a bias for dividends and buybacks. And remember also we did talk about, in my prepared remarks, we talked about the fact that we're going to probably pick up the pace on non-core asset sales and that's also a source of funds for continuing to strengthen the balance sheet, but also for potentially for more returns to shareholders as well. So we feel pretty good about that balance and the 60% level. As John indicated, we don't -- we're not particular fans of the variable dividends at this point in time. We will consider -- will keep -- we'll continue to look at that for the future and consider how the market reacts to those. I think the variable dividend needs to be in general, a smaller piece. And just in terms of balancing dividends versus buybacks, for now we're just happy to lean into buybacks. We believe our share price is too low. We've been discounting for several months now greater than 25% free cash flow yield, one of the highest in the peer group. We don't believe our base cash flow generating capacity is actually fully appreciated by the market. And we need to continue to work on that. We know that. But for now the share price is just too low, so we will continue with leaning in on the buybacks. We know we need to have a competitive ordinary dividend yield. And it needs to be competitive against other E&P s as well as the broader market. And I think that's probably higher than what we see is the typical 2% ordinary dividend yield we see today. And we'll figure that out and it's about getting to a balance around what's the right strength of Balance Sheet that certainly is spending to something stronger. But also what price are we going to base all of that on, because I think it's a valid question is to what we all think mid-cycle price is now. We'll get on with raising the dividend as well. We just need to be thoughtful about that. It was only 18 months ago that we cut the dividend by 90% and that was a pretty painful process. We're going to make sure we don't put ourselves in a situation where we have to do something like that again. Probably more than you added for, but I wanted to take the opportunity to lay out a lot of context around the returns framework.
Neal Dingmann: No, I appreciate. I think what you said about the -- both said about the Total return makes a lot of -- or about the shared buybacks makes sense. And one just quick follow-up, John, just thoughts on future of, I'd say near-term, medium-term Alpine High activity given not only the strong natural gas prices post the Altice deal and even that Schneer long-term supply contract agreement seems to be get you closer to fruition. So given all that, maybe what you could say about Alpine High.
John Christmann: When you look at our U.S. program, we've got 2 rigs in the southern Midland Basin. We picked up another 1 that's in the Chalk now. We've indicated we will be adding another rig, probably middle of next year, which will put us 3 that will go to Permian. And quite frankly then we envision those rigs working those assets in tandem. We're in pad drilling. You will be seeing those move. And what the time it takes on the unconventional side to mobilize a rig, drill pads, and see production. Your short-term windows are benefiting from those right now at Alpine High with the dokcs that we did earlier, right? So I think you're going to see our very well thought out efficient capital program in the U.S., where we're moving those rigs around those place based on the, how we've laid the inventory out in the infrastructure, so we can maximize those returns. But there is a portion of the Altice piece if we sell the -- sell down shares that we do put in there, but it will all fit into our framework. So it's nice to have quality inventory and options, because then we can just really plan it out and be thoughtful, but you'll see activity across our Permian next year in a very thoughtful way.
Neal Dingmann: Got it. Thank you all so much for the time.
John Christmann: You bet. Thank you, Neal.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ciara from Stifel. You may ask your question.
Michael Scialla: Yeah. Good morning, buddy. See what the next steps would be at [Indiscernible] the issue with both appraisals. They're just lack of reservoir quality sands as you stepped out. Did you just step out too far in the edge so you need to move back towards the discoveries with the next appraisals or is it more complicated than that?
John Christmann: Mike, it's a good question. I will tell you that at [Indiscernible] it was a big step out. We know it looked a little different in terms of the signature. So we knew there was more risk to it. But there is work to do at Cadcassie, in closer. But I think from the priorities, it will all be put into is your working across all the discoveries and the appraisal program. We're integrating data. We've prioritized for the appraisal there things that you would be what I'll call lower GOR black oil that you could potentially fast-track. And so we're working those in a queue based on the learnings, we've integrated everything in. Some of that will come to one of the reasons why crab to go is the next exploration well. It's in the neighborhood and we like the way it looks. So I think it's all part of an integrated plan.
Michael Scialla: Okay. Helpful. And maybe just to follow-up on Neal 's question. Can you talk about that decision to put the third rig in the Chalk versus the Midland or Alpine High. And Steve mentioned a plan to add a fourth rig next year. Any early preview on where that might land. I guess, any possibility of going beyond four rigs, and then U.S. next year.
David Pursell: Yes. This is David Pursell, good question. So remember on the Chalk we talked about drawing a handful of wells in our Brazes County acreage position. One, because we're trying to maintain optionality. We -- we've had significant experience a bit to the West and the Washington County area and we had a decent acreage position put together and wanted to hold it together and we liked what we've seen so far. It's consistent with the geology we've seen in Washington County in well results. And so we really just want to leverage that experience. We liked what we saw and felt like it was time to put a rig there and continue to progress that position. The thing to remember it's near infrastructure. There's a lot of pipe infrastructure in the area. It's less than a 100 miles from Houston Ship Channel. So we're getting Henry Hub pricing and LLS pricing for the crude. The GORs are little bit higher than what you typically see in the Permian. So there's a little bit of a gas component too, which we like in these markets. So for us it was a pretty easy decision on the Chalk. The extra rig we talked about, the incremental rig in the middle of 2022. I think it's important to point out, first of all, as you -- as we think about adding another rig, it's harder to stand up a rig quickly, it's a couple of quarters to from the time you make that decision till the time you're turning to the right just because of long lead items in supply chain issues and to make sure that we have everything we need to keep that rig running. I think John highlighted that there is a lot to do in the Permian. We have two rigs in the southern Midland Basin. We have a lot of development inventory that we're not getting to, which includes Alpine High and we have a lot of good opportunities for that rig and we'll post John those in February that you can imagine that Alpine would be on that list of places we'd be looking to drill next year.
Stephen Riney : And to be clear, there will be no fifth rig in the onshore U.S. next year.
David Pursell: Yes -- Yes. Thank you, Steve.
Michael Scialla: Thanks, guys.
John Christmann: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Bob Brackett : Good morning all. Just a question following up on the Austin Chalk and the Alpine High, how do you think longer-term about the balance of gas-directed drilling versus oil-directed drilling, any thoughts there?
David Pursell: Bob, I think the beauty of the diverse portfolio is we have the ability to flex that. And so I'm going to give you a non-answer because it really depends on where commodity markets go. Obviously, we've got a very constructive crude market and our gas markets is becoming more constructive. We'd like to see the back end of the gas curve strengthen a little bit from here. But again with the diverse portfolio, both diverse in the Permian and diverse globally, we have the ability to flex and move, and take advantage of commodity markets across the globe. So I'll leave it at that, but we're getting -- we're watching the forward curve on gas let's just leave it at that.
Bob Brackett : Okay perfectly clear. We're traveling the globe, can you talk about inflation and sort of what's you're baking in domestically, where you might be seeing something a bit higher versus maybe some of the international assets. What's baked into that sort of capex guide in terms of inflation?
John Christmann: Yes, Bob, you look today and this is the commodities, right? I mean steel is up, where we've got fuel. Your power costs, you are people costs. But it's really steel and people, is how we frame it. And we have factored some of that into that capital number, as we look at our programs. And then we try to get ahead on the purchases. And so, if you get into the middle of '22, it is baked into our capital numbers.
Bob Brackett : Any difference domestically versus internationally? And is there a number you'd hazard to throw out?
John Christmann: No. I mean, I think you can look at those numbers and easily you get into the -- I mean, 15-20% number easily, and in some places even higher, but not a lot of difference between the two. You just don't have -- I mean, the nice thing about a places like Egypt there's not as much competition for rig ads and things. And so it's probably easier to pick up rigs in Egypt than I would say in the U.S. Just because I take you back to 2014, we were running 28 rigs there. So it's not like we're going up to a level where we've got to bring the equipment in and those sorts of things. Hello Dave, any more specific you want to say?
David Pursell: The only thing I'd add is if you think about the type of drilling that we did in Egypt, its vertical wells. It's more commodity drilling compared to what we're doing in the Permian where a lot of the well cost is really on the completion side. So just less I think John hit it, there's less inflation in Egypt and astray just because of the type of wells that we tend to drill day in and day out.
John Christmann: The other thing I would add, Bob, is some of the targeted divestments have man on our higher water cuts. From Basin Platform properties where we're burning more energy and moving more fluid and those types of things are helping our numbers too in terms of what we're targeting. So there's -- we're trying to be really smart about the portfolio and factoring all those in.
Bob Brackett : Great, that makes sense. Thanks much.
Operator: Your next question is from Leo Mariani from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Leo Mariani: Hi guys. Just wanted to follow up on the stock buyback program here. I guess, high level you guys talked about roughly I guess $2 billion of free cash flow. There's some dividend here, but 60% to the buyback I mean, that certainly could imply North of a billion dollars on the buyback. And just in our math, that's certainly seems to be a very large percentage of your shares outstanding currently approaching 15%, upwards of that maybe in one year or next year. Just wanted to get a sense of do you guys think that a number that size is roughly correct and is it feasible to buyback that much stock?
Stephen Riney : Well, if the share price stays roughly where it is, and that'll be the outcome, yes. And if oil prices stay where they are.
Leo Mariani: Right. Okay.
Stephen Riney : And, yes, I think it is feasible. Yes.
Leo Mariani: Okay. And then just wanted to follow-up on the Austin Chalk here. So obviously, it's like this point you've dedicated rig. In your slide deck you talked about one well result looked very strong. Presumably there's probably more than that in terms of results that maybe you guys have seen out there. I was hoping maybe you could give us a little bit more color in terms of inventory of aerial extent of where you guys have drilled. Is there an acreage number you think is a sweet spot out there for you that, would give you just a number of years of inventory and maybe just more color about what that rig is doing. Is it all development work? Is there going to be a mix of some exploration in there? Can you maybe just provide a little bit more color about what the run rig is doing and what you've seen so far?
John Christmann: One comment from me is, not only do we have the operated rig, but we're also amount up on some of Magnolia's operations, so there's quite a bit of data. Dave, I'll let you jumped in.
David Pursell: Yeah. It's good question. The way -- on the Brazos County side, we haven't really talked yet about the sides of this, but there is some -- I wouldn't call it exploration, but there is some additional delineation work we're doing to see how big this could be. But when we look at it, there's easily over five rig years worth of development to do in this one spot. So again, we're leveraging a lot of our knowledge on the work we've done over in the Washington County area as operator and as John suggested, a fairly significant non-op position. We'll leave it at that.
Leo Mariani: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Next is from John Freeman, from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
John Freeman : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.
John Christmann: You better, John.
John Freeman : I wanted to follow up on Alpine High, which I'm sure you would have -- a couple of quarters ago, I don't think we would have realized that we haven't multiple questions on Alpine High, but obviously a lot of things change. And so I guess, when I look at the Alpine High and what gas NGL prices have done. And then following up on the recent Altice - EagleClaw deal where those processing gathering rigs got a heck of a lot more attractive. And then I know that you have done some stuff on wider spacing than you are used to do there as well. I'm just curious as it sounds pretty likely that that fourth rate will go to Alpine High if we might -- there might be some plan to get an update on the economic model for Alpine High cause it has been quite a while since we've seen it.
David Pursell: Yes, John, this is Dave. We look for that as we get into 2022 and really kind of hone in on where that additional rigs are going to focus. But you're right. I mean, it's not just gas price and cost structure. We've done some things on performance, on some of the docks with spacing as well as its prac design and some of those wells are in the public domain and the results are very, very good and certainly exceeded our expectations. So there's a number of factors that would drive us to really focus on Alpine as well as some of the other opportunities out there.
John Freeman : Okay. And then just the follow-up question on Egypt. So if I heard you right, John, it sounded like the 11 rigs was going to go higher post the modernization, getting completed if I heard that right. And obviously it's been a while since we've been at this sort of an activity set. So Egypt until at least Suriname gets to a point where it's at first oil, Egypt becomes the growth driver for the Company. And I guess I'm just curious when we think historically has been an 8 rig program or so would try and keep production roughly flat if we go 11 rigs plus. Is it a double-digit type growing asset just I guess any additional color how you're thinking about Egypt.
John Christmann: Clearly, we've been gradually ramping, right? We went from 5 -- we started the year around 5 rigs, we went to 8, now we are at 11. The plan would be to go up another step. I don't see us going back -- needing to go back to where we once were in the mid-20 range. But it will -- it's going to turn the corner. We've been under -- slightly under-investing in Egypt for quite a number of years. And definitely we'll turn the trajectory the other way, which is what Egypt wants. And quite frankly, part of the overall win-win that 's in this for Egypt and APA.
John Freeman : Got it. Thanks. I appreciate it.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Michael Scialla from Stifel. Your line is now open.
Michael Scialla: Actually, John just asked my 2 questions, but I'll ask one more. The asset retirement liability being put back to you with those Gulf of Mexico assets, does Fieldwood continue to operate there and do you have any input on what they do there?
Stephen Riney : No. Those assets came out of Fieldwood, so the Legacy Fieldwood Company is now a Company called Quarter North. And they don't own the old Fieldwood assets that Apache had sold to them. Those came out and went into an interview that we now call Tom Shelf. There is a person that's contract managing those assets because there are assets that are still producing. But the contract today is in place with Quarter North, the old field with organization to operate those assets for us, and we will continue to evaluate whether that's the best long-term situation.
Michael Scialla: Is there any thought on just taken over or could you potentially take over operations there? Or do you want -- if you've got the -- all the liability, would it make sense to operate it yourself?
Stephen Riney : We'd have to ask the lawyers that of whether we can operate those assets or not. I believe there's some issues with us being able to operate them. But I doubt that we would take over operatorship of those assets at this point in time. These are -- so there are -- the nature of the assets there, there's the -- a large inventory of properties that came out of Fieldwood. A number of them are in abandonment activity today. And a number of them -- a smaller number of them are operating and still generating free cash flow. And I won't go through the details unless somebody wants me to, but we booked a net, $1.2 billion liability on our balance sheet. That's the gross abandonment obligation, less the free cash flows that we see coming out of those assets for their remaining life. And then we also booked on the asset side of our Balance Sheet $740 million of various forms of financial security that we have in place to fund that abandonment obligations. So a net liability on our part, a net obligation of about 450 million, that obligation won't --we won't -- we won't actually start funding anything on that obligation until 2026 at the soonest, in terms of costs that could be incurred, that we wouldn't have any form of reimbursement for. And then that would carry over for about 5 or 6 years after 2026 in terms of that
Stephen Riney : situation. The present value of all of those costs today are about 250 million. Guess we had to book an undiscounted number of the 450 million. The other thing I just might comment on is that the way we went about doing the work, because we only got access to the raw data behind all of this in August and we've been scouring through that since we got that. We've looked hard at abandonment costs and we've looked at -- the 2nd priority was to look at the operating assets and the cash flow from the PDPs on those. And then the 3rd priority was to look at the capital investment opportunities, because any assets like these are going to have uphold recompletion opportunities and things like that. That was the third priority and we really haven't gotten through all of those. There are literally hundreds of capital investment opportunities. We got to the ones that, we think -- we thought were the highest priorities seemed like the best opportunities. And so those are included in the free cash flows. But we think there are more. We think that, there are opportunities to reduce the operating and overhead costs in the PDPs and we believe there are probably more opportunities in investment side that, we just haven't been able to get to yet. So we'll be -- we should be watching for those over the coming quarters. And that has a decent chance of possibly bringing that $450 million liability down over time. And that would also decrease obviously, the present value of that opportunity.
Michael Scialla: Thanks for the detail on that, Steve. One more. You'd mentioned Steve, that the divestitures you plan next year. I know you guys don't want to give detail on that, but I'm just curious. Can you speak broadly as to what assets might be put in that divestiture bucket or I'm assuming they are on the domestic side and outside of your 3 core areas or were core interception?
John Christmann: Mike actually, we sold some Central Basin Platform properties earlier this year that were higher costs, higher water cut, later life in the country for having a portfolio for a long long time. What I call some of the legacy. You can anticipate more of those types of assets is probably what would make sense.
Michael Scialla: Yeah. Okay. Very good. Thank you, guys.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: You have your last question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Doug Leggate : Hey guys. Sorry for double-dipping today, but I have a couple of things I wanted some clarification on so I queued up again. First one is -- on the buyback I think I missed the comment and I'll ask a question like this. When you take disposals potentially into account, as well as, I guess we've already dealt with the Egyptian thing as it relates to cash flow. Is it an upward limit on how aggressive you would expect to be with the buybacks? In absolute terms?
John Christmann: No.
Doug Leggate : Okay. Simple enough. My focus is
Stephen Riney : So just to get a bit of color on that, Doug, I think again, I think our shares are trading at a pretty meaningful discount today. They have improved over the last month or so and that no doubt as part of the purpose of the buyback. But we believe there's still trading at a meaningful discount relative to the price environment we find ourselves in. And we just think that's, for long-term shareholders, that's one of the better investment opportunities we can make, so we'll continue doing that. As long as the free Cash Flow holds up. So that's why we say it's a minimum of 60%.
Doug Leggate : Steve, the 5-1/4 million, does that go to the Balance Sheet or does that go to buybacks as well, because that's not technically Operating cash flow?
Stephen Riney : Yes we're just going to remain noncommittal on what the buybacks, and for that matter, the other 40% can go to the -- I mean the disposal proceeds and the other 40% of free Cash flow because we'll deal with that as it occurs. Could go to Balance Sheet strengthening, could go to more buybacks, could raise the dividend quicker. We've got -- we've got a number of things on the horizon with Egypt modernization also occurring. So we've got a lot of things still ahead of us here.
Doug Leggate : I don't want to labor the point but credit agencies, do they have a view on the buyback, have you run this past them to get their opinion?
Stephen Riney : We haven't spoken to them yet, but we will be speaking with them shortly.
Doug Leggate : Okay. And my last one --
Stephen Riney : We will reassure them of the same thing that we've talked about here today. We're still going to have plenty of free cash flow to do further balance sheet improvements and [Indiscernible] from asset disposals, if we need to do that and if we feel like that's the best thing to do at the point in time.
Doug Leggate : Thank you. My follow-up is a real quick one for clarification. Cheniere is your contract kicking in pari - passu with their 3rd Corpus Christi development, which is not even FID-ed yet. My understanding was that that contract to become effective middle of next year. Can you just offer some clarification on the timing? And maybe what you would expect that the ultimate tooling costs to be for you guys.
Stephen Riney : Yes, I can certainly comment on the first part of that. Our contract is, while it was in the context of FID in another project, it's not contractually tied to any project. And so it's just a contract that, starts in 2023 and runs for 15 years. A 140 million cubic feet a day, and Schneer has an option to bring that forward one year to start it in mid 2022, July of 2022. And we were waiting to see if they will exercise that option.
Doug Leggate : Alright, thanks folks.
John Christmann: Thank you Doug.
Operator: That ends our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to John Christmann for closing remarks.
John Christmann: Thank you. And before ending today's call, I'd like to leave you with the three following points. First, we're taking prudent and appropriate steps now to increase our capital investment to a level that will enable us to sustain production on a global basis for many years. Our portfolio offers considerable depth and flexibility to do this efficiently. Second, we're generating substantial free cash flow in this environment, which we currently estimate will be around $2 billion for the full-year 2021 and again in 2022. And lastly, we are committed to returning a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow via dividends and share buybacks. And we're demonstrating our commitment to this process right now in the Fourth Quarter. Thank you for participating in our call today. Operator, I'll turn it over to you.
Operator: That concludes the conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-05 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the APA Corporation's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President for Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Gary Clark: Good morning and thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's second quarter 2021 financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and 2021 outlook. Tracey Henderson, Senior Vice President of Exploration; Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President, Development, will also be available on the call to answer questions. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 12 minutes in length and the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our first quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. In my prepared remarks, I will review APA Corporation's second quarter results and comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2021. The company is making good progress on several key initiatives. We generated nearly $400 million of free cash flow during the second quarter and, at June 30, held approximately $1.2 billion of cash, which will be used primarily for debt reduction. In May, we reached an agreement in principle with the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum and Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation to modernize the terms of our production sharing contracts. The final draft of which has now been completed and will move to Egyptian Parliament for ratification in the fall and then to the President for his approval. We are pleased with the progress thus far and believe that this modernization will return Egypt to the most attractive area for capital investment within our portfolio, and will put Egyptian oil production back on a growth trajectory. In Suriname, as announced in our press release last week, we drilled a successful appraisal well in the Sapakara area moving us closer to our goal of sanctioning the first commercial oil development. We are generating strong results from our DUC completion program in the Permian. And during the second quarter, we closed two smaller scale Central Basin platform asset sales, as we continued to optimize our portfolio. On the ESG front, APA continues to deliver on our key initiatives and safety metrics. Most notably at the beginning of the year, we established an ambitious goal of eliminating routine flaring in the US in 2021, and I am pleased to announce that we will achieve this goal in the third quarter. This is the result of adding compression where appropriate, setting clear expectations and rules in the field and improving hydrocarbon processing at location. These efforts have also helped to drive down our flaring intensity, which is tracking well below our goal of less than 1% for the year. We are also making great progress on our water initiatives. In the US, we are currently at 3% freshwater usage, which is also well below our goal of less than 20% for the year. Turning now to operations. Total adjusted production exceeded our guidance in the second quarter, with the US benefiting from better than expected performance throughout our Permian Basin DUC completion program. This more than offset lower international volumes, where higher oil prices impacted Egypt cost recovery volumes and we experienced extended operational downtime in the North Sea. Upstream capital investment was below our guidance for the quarter, primarily due to timing while LOE was slightly above expectations. Our full year outlook for these items remains unchanged. In the US, we placed a total of 27 wells online in the Permian, including five at Alpine High. In aggregate, these wells are significantly exceeding internal expectations, driven by a combination of optimization initiatives. This effectively completes our backlog of Permian DUCs, so you will see fewer well connections during the second half of the year. You will also see Permian production come down a bit in the second half of the year, as our current pace of drilling and completions is not sufficient to offset the initial declines from the DUC completion program. As previously planned, we added a second Permian Basin rig in late June, which will enable a steadier pace of completions. In the East Texas, Austin Chalk, we drilled three operated wells, and are pleased with the results thus far. We are evaluating the addition of a third drilling rig in the US, as previously noted, which would put us on a path to sustained oil production. Given strong oil prices and the recent improvement in natural gas and NGL prices, all of our US asset areas are attractive candidates for this rig addition. In Egypt, we have increased our rig count to eight and continued to build high quality inventory across our expanded acreage footprint. Facilities expansion constrained our ability to connect wells in the first half of the year and contributed to a decline in gross production during the second quarter. As we wrap up, our facilities work, well connections will increase significantly in the second half of the year, and gross production will begin trending up. In the North Sea, we continue to operate one floating rig and one platform rig crew. During the second quarter production was impacted by compressor downtime, extended platform turnaround work and third-party pipeline outages. Some of this carried over into July and when combined with planned maintenance turnarounds at Beryl will lead to only a modest production increase in the third quarter. Once we conclude this heavy maintenance period, production volumes in the North Sea should return to more normalized levels in the fourth quarter. In Suriname's Block 58, we are running two rigs. Upon completion of drilling operations at Sapakara, the Maersk Valiant will mobilize to the Bonboni exploration prospect approximately 45 kilometers to the north. Following Bonboni, the Valiant will return the flow test the Sapakara South-1 well. Drilling activities continue at the Keskesi South-1 appraisal well with the Maersk developer. On Block 53, where APA is the operator and 45% working interest owner, we recently signed a contract with Noble Corporation to secure a drillship that will commence exploration operations in the first quarter of 2022. Before turning the call over to Steve, I would like to comment on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Oil prices, year-to-date, have averaged well above our original budgeted level of $45 WTI. And more recently, gas and NGL prices have also begun to significantly exceed budgeted levels. This has created a very welcome amount of incremental free cash flow, and will enable substantial progress on debt reduction this year. More importantly, our 2021 capital program will remain unchanged at $1.1 billion, even if we decide to add a third rig in the US later this year. In June, we opened our Houston and Midland offices and began welcoming back the majority of our office staff, as permitted by regional guidelines. It has been great to see more in-person collaboration in settings that we took for granted prior to COVID-19. And we will remain diligent with our protocols to keep employees safe. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on the second quarter and our 2021 outlook.
Stephen Riney: Thank you, John. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, APA Corporation reported second quarter 2021 consolidated net income of $316 million or $0.82 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings. Excluding the second quarter impacts of divestiture gains, movements in our tax valuation allowance, mark-to-market derivative losses, and other smaller items, adjusted net income was $266 million or $0.70 per share. Most of our financial results were in line or better than guidance this quarter with just a few minor exceptions. As we've discussed in the past, we continuously review our portfolio for the right time to monetize assets that no longer compete for funding. In the second quarter, we closed the sales of two such packages in the Central Basin platform. These were mostly lower margin conventional waterflood assets, which were producing roughly 2500 barrels of oil per day. Proceeds from the sales were $178 million. As we look forward to the rest of 2021, we are updating some of our full year guidance items. We are effectively increasing us production guidance by 4500 BOEs per day and decreasing international adjusted production guidance by 14,500 BOEs per day, compared to the midpoint of the previous respective ranges. This net decrease of 10,000 views per day for the full year reflects the strong underlying performance of our US assets but it also captures the impact of a few offsets; the unplanned operational downtime in the North Sea, the impact of higher oil prices on Egypt cost recovery barrels, and the recent Permian Basin asset sales. We are reducing full year DD&A guidance by $125 million, which reflects a combination of price-related reserves additions, and the impact of our changing production mix with lower North Sea volumes and higher US volumes. Finally, other than an increase to our expected UK tax expense, due to strong commodity prices, there are no material changes to the remainder of our guidance for the year. On a longer-term perspective, one of our most important strategic goals is to return to investment grade status, which will require a significant reduction in debt. In the near term, progress towards this goal takes priority over the capital program, which today is still below a sustaining level of development capital. In other words, we are willing to under-invest slightly in the short term to build balance sheet strength and financial resilience for the longer term. We entered 2021, anticipating a multi-year process of debt reduction. With this price environment, we're making significant progress, more quickly than we thought possible. In the first half of the year, at an average WTI price of $62, we delivered upstream only free cash flow, which excludes dividends received from Altus Midstream of $860 million. Assuming current strip prices for the second half of 2021, upstream only free cash flow for the full year is expected to be around $1.7 billion. The vast majority of this cash will be available for debt reduction. The rating agencies will ultimately decide when we return to investment grade, but we will clearly make significant progress in 2021. With meaningful progress on debt insight, we would remind everyone that we have a strong portfolio of investable inventory and it would be prudent to at least increase development capital to a production sustaining level. We estimate this would require around $1.2 billion of annual investment versus the $900 million we are investing in development capital this year. At this investment pace, and assuming prices remain flat over 2021, as we look out to the next several years, APA is capable of generating upstream-only free cash flow of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion annually. This is all based on our current portfolio of assets and to highlight what the current portfolio can deliver, this analysis assumes no further investment or future benefit from Suriname and no free cash flow uplift associated with Egypt modernization, which is still pending. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Doug Leggate: Thank you. Good morning. Good morning, everybody.
John Christmann: Good morning, Doug.
Doug Leggate: One for Steve and one for you, John, if that is okay. Steve, thank you first of all for clarifying the more than $1 billion of free cash flow, that is much appreciate. The question I have is sustainability of that. The key thing for us is the value of the base business is how long you can sustain that cash? Well, you said for a significant amount of time, can you put some parameters around that, so we can kind of back into what the market isn't paying for, and I've got a follow up please.
Stephen Riney: Yeah, Doug and let me actually put some parameters around the whole 1.6 billion to 1.7 billion of free cash flow that I talked about in my prepared remarks. And John said, it gets confusing because of the same numbers but John talked about 2021 being 1.7 billion of free cash flow, and that's based on first half actual prices plus the second half strip. And that is our internal, most current outlook for the business for the full year. In 2022, we say 1.6 billion to 1.7 billion of free cash flow and that is sustainable for a run of years and we can talk about that a bit. I put two caveats on that. Number one, we're not attempting, in any way, to give guidance for '22 and beyond at this point in time. That's a hypothetical case but I want people to understand that that's a very realistic case. We know our inventory today better than we've ever known it. And we've put together a realistic case, based on what we would actually invest in, in the current price environment. As I said, in my remarks, it is focused on the current portfolio. So, we've kind of chosen to eliminate the noise associated with Suriname, doesn't have any future Suriname CapEx, no future Suriname production or free cash flow. And just to be clear, we don't want that to come across as any reflection on our feelings about Suriname because that doesn't reflect that at all. The prices that we used in that case are exactly the same as the 2021 prices because I didn't want those to affect the comparability of the results. The CapEx, as we know, 2021 is 1.1 billion; in our hypothetical case for '22 and beyond, it's 1.2 billion. There's a difference though, the 1.1 billion includes $200 million of exploration spend, which is mostly focused on Suriname exploration and appraisal, so there's only 900 million of development capital in there. The 1.2 billion for '22 is all development capital. And we've talked about a number of slightly lower than that, 1.1 billion is sustaining capital development or capital spending; that was when we were talking about sustaining oil production volume. The case that we put together now sustains the 1.2 billion sustained BOEs on a per day basis. So, it actually is full production sustaining for a run of years; that's adding capital to mostly to Egypt and to the US. Under this case, there's a slight decline in volume from '21 to '22, on an annualized basis, but then it's sustained from 2022 forward. So, some people might be wondering, okay, you're spending 100 million more of CapEx and you have a lower volume, but free cash flow is roughly the same, from '21 to '22. How do you do that? First, there's debt paid down assumed in that, so there is less interest expense because we are going to pay down somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.5 billion of debt, a little more than that, including what was on the revolver at the beginning of the year. And then the other thing that people may not fully appreciate is that the forward look, our production mix is changing. The spending will create a decline in gas volume and growth in oil volume. So, again, prior case we talked about was a lower capital because it was just sustaining oil volume; this one is sustaining total volume, but growing oil relative to gas. And again, a reminder, that doesn't include anything in there for Egypt DUC [ph] modernization, which is going to be meaningful. The specific question that you had about the - how long this is sustainable, if we want to get into the inventory, I'd let David Pursell take that. I'll give him a chance to make a comment here quickly. But this is - when I say for a run of years, I'll say stick with a comment I made last time, you asked me this question Doug and that is, this is at least for 5 to 10 years that we can see out into the future. David, you have anything to add?
David Pursell: I would just confirm that it's well beyond - it's in that kind of 10-year window, well beyond five years. And once you get beyond 10, it's hard to think about anybody paying for that inventory, but it has sustained - it has absolute sustainability to it.
Doug Leggate: Well, guys, thanks for the detailed answer. I really appreciate that because that's kind of what I was really trying to get to. I'm going to - I love the tip of the hat Egypt to be significant. I'm guessing you're not going to answer that question, so I'm going to go as soon on, John, if you don't mind. You saw what we said about this, it seems to me that if you're 2.5 miles away, with pretty much the same thickness on the formation and your oil target in Sapakara. You're going to start to get some idea of tank [ph] size. I likely know that we had a chance to speak with the head of [indiscernible] talked about this as being “massive”. So I wonder if you could just offer any thoughts on resource scale, at this point? And maybe a little bit of an explanation as to why not full past that [ph] time? Why do you have to come back to [indiscernible]? Thanks.
John Christmann: Now, Doug, I appreciate the question. So, I mean, we are in the middle of the appraisal. And as we said, we have not flow tested, Sapakara South. Unfortunately, just to clarify, the testing equipment on the valiant is damaged and that's why, otherwise we'd be flow testing that thing now. But it's going to take some time to repair that equipment and that's why the ship is going to sail on up to Bonboni and get onto the expiration well that we're excited about. But we need we need flow tests there and we're in the middle of appraisal, so we have not put out volumes yet. I mean, clearly, we're fine tuning things and working with things, and we've talked about this being an important step towards potentially an FID, but it's just a little bit premature to get into areas and those things until we gather a lot more data. And we'll do that as we continue to appraise and analyze what we've collected, but we're clearly excited about it. Having 30 meters of one Rocky sand that's full base, high quality is the type of thing that you can build around because you've got your age there. But there's a lot more to do here and a lot more appraise.
Doug Leggate: [indiscernible] current model, half a billion dollars.
John Christmann: Repeat that, Doug. You cut out on me, Doug, I did not hear.
Doug Leggate: Sorry. Are we out for launch [ph] on our tank model to suggest order magnitude with [indiscernible] contact you could do setting on half a billion barrels on that prospect?
John Christmann: I'm just not going to comment at this point. We've got more appraisal. I appreciate the question and I'm going to stick to where we are. It's early. We're appraising and - but we're clearly excited about it but I'm not going to comment, on your question there.
Doug Leggate: Can't blame me for trying. Thanks. Well, I appreciate.
John Christmann: Yep, not at all.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.
John Freeman: Good morning, guys.
John Christmann: Good morning, John.
John Freeman: The first question, I just wanted to clarify one thing on Egypt. So if you had the five rigs last quarter, you're now running eight rigs. When we sort of think about the PSC being approved, and obviously, I've been vocal and again on this call about that would - once it's approved, that's going to see an increase in activity. I'm just trying to make sure that I'm using the right baseline so that the incremental five rigs to eight rigs, I always - I know, there was always some incremental activity planned in the second half, but is the eight rigs, the baseline that we're supposed to use ahead of PSC or was there any, maybe, additional rig or two that was added, sort of, in anticipation of the PSC being approved? Just want to make sure, when I'm thinking about 2020 modeling, that I'm using right starting point.
John Christmann: Well, I mean, clearly we're taking some steps that we've agreed with them. But in terms of your baselines for capital, and those items, I think we're in the fairway to stay where we are. Dave, anything you want to add?
David Pursell: John, I think it's a good question. We've said - I think hinted in the past that we think we need eight to nine rigs to keep oil production flat in Egypt and I think you'll see the eight rigs get us pretty close to that, and then, we'll see where we go after modernization. But I think I think John and Steve, both, talked about those modernization could put us on a path to grow in Egypt. So, if eight rigs sustain, that, I think, is a pretty good baseline on your model.
John Freeman: Okay, great. And then just my follow-up in conjunction, Steve, with the detailed response, you gave to Doug's question when sort of hypothetically thinking about 2022. So if I take what you just said, on Egypt and the eight rigs will already have sort of maintained levels, and we'll just assume something north of that, so like Egypt, post PSC would be growing. The North Sea, you previously talked about one rig, one platform can kind of maintain volumes at that 55,000 to 60,000 range. Obviously, first half of this year, due to the extended maintenance, you're a good bit below that. So just by default, the North Sea is going to be up a decent bit in '22 versus '21. And then the Permian, it sounds likely - the base case sounds like it would be to add the third rig in the Permian here in '21, which gets that back to sort of a flattish, sort of a sustained sort of profile, so, ex-Suriname, just hypothetically, thinking about those regions, right.
Stephen Riney: Yeah, I think directionally, John, that's about right. Most of the increased capital will be going to Egypt and a bit to the North Sea is, I mean, to the US as well. Probably not a whole lot of additional capital in the North Sea, if any, but it'll be better production in the North Sea simply because of the downtime that we've had this year, which is both planned and unplanned. It has been pretty material for second and third quarter. But again, I just remind you, John, that this is a hypothetical case, we're not trying to give any type of guidance or rolling out specific capital plans for 2022. That's still ahead of us for later this year. We'll talk about that some probably with third quarter earnings.
John Freeman: No, understood. It is the knuckleheaded almost like a little be doing the speculating but I appreciate all the answers, guys.
John Christmann: Thank you, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.
Bob Brackett: Good morning, all. Thanks for taking my question. I might be over interpreting this, but the fact that the Maersk developer is going to come back and appraise Keskesi South, does that mean that if you get a successful result on the well test, that's all the information you'll need on Sapakara to move it forward to FID or would you expect more appraisal wells there?
John Christmann: At this point, Bob, it clearly needs to come back. We need a flow test. But I'll just say we still are appraising and we may need more appraisal, and so I wouldn't read into it anything more than that.
Bob Brackett: Okay. Just, so there's multiple opportunities to move forward in the appraisal pipeline.
John Christmann: Correct.
Bob Brackett: Okay. Thanks for that.
John Christmann: You bet.
Operator: You next question comes from the line of Michael Scialla with Stifel.
Guillermo Garcia: Good morning, everyone and thank you for taking my question. This is actually Guillermo stepping in for Mike. I was wondering if you could provide some additional color on the CBP asset sale. You foresee to monetize more non-core assets like this one and are there any other assets in the US that you would want to increase your presence on?
John Christmann: I mean, I think we've always looked at the portfolio as something that's kind of in flux. We're always looking for things that make sense to monetize, characterize what we sold is pretty high water cut, higher lifting cost, some properties we've had in the portfolio for quite some time, and quite frankly, it's time to move those along the food chain to somebody else that will put more focus attention on them, and quite frankly a little cheaper cost structure. But at this point, nothing major is planned, is always is the case. We like to report on these after we've done things but we're constantly looking at a number of things, so - but nothing major plan at this point.
Guillermo Garcia: That's helpful. Thank you and my follow up, maybe on inflation. Are you seeing them inflation in the drilling rates? You're planning to add that third rig, so I was just wondering if you would foresee a more expensive rate on that additional rig?
John Christmann: I think, in general, on the inflation side, we had a lot of our key items secured for this year. I think you get into 2022 and we are seeing some uptick and things that are around the commodities, people, things like that but I don't know. Anything, particular, Dave, on rig contracts you want to comment on.
David Pursell: Yeah, I think if you're looking for places for inflation, the completion side and pressure pumping and frac is where you'll see more inflation, we have that dealt into our forward plat. Anything that has to do with commodities whether it's steel or on LOE with chemicals and diesel usage, you'll obviously price inflation there but when we look at our forward plan, we think we have it adequately captured.
Guillermo Garcia: That's helpful. Thank you. That's it for me and congrats on the quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist.
Neal Dingmann: Oh, sorry about that, I was on mute. Hi, guys. Two quick ones I could. First, just on sort of capital allocation, how you're thinking about things, my question is, I guess, once you obviously start ramping up in Egypt, is that going to simultaneously then - would that take capital away from the US and others? Or I'm just wondering, could you talk about the thoughts about when that happens, kind of, how you view that activity versus what you're thinking domestically?
John Christmann: Well, I mean, I think we've got a pretty good base run that we're running right now. And that's where we've been. We've been pretty consistent. We did pick up the first two rigs, early this year. We added the second rig in the Permian. We had a rig that drilled four wells in the Chalk in East Texas, in the US. But in North Sea, it has been pretty constant. Egypt, we've kind of moved from five or six rigs up to eight, but in general pretty, pretty level loaded, pretty constant. And I think it'll be pretty consistent, it is building blocks going forward. You will post modernization see some changes to Egypt, but it will not impact cash flow or the capital in the other areas in a negative way, so.
Neal Dingmann: Okay, got it. I assumed that but it is good to hear that, John, and then just a follow-up for you, Steve. To me, given what appears to be the strong transparency you continue to have with free cash flow, when do you all think about, I don't know, either call it notably or materially boosting dividends or free cash flow in addition to that - your solid debt repayment program that you continue with?
John Christmann: I mean, I think the first priority is exactly that. We came in to this year with too much debt, and we plan to pay that down, as Steve has made very clear. I think, once we make progress there, then you can start to think about the dividend, but the first priority has been the debt. And clearly, we're on a much faster pace there than we would have envisioned at the start of the year. But anything you want to add, Steve?
Stephen Riney: No. Neal, I'd just say that when do we think about it? We think about that all the time. We do realize it's important and we need to do that. And so, I'm sure with the amount of debt paid down that we're going to accomplish this year, we'll be talking about that in due course. But it is certainly moving forward, not backwards.
Neal Dingmann: That clearly is seen. Thank you. Thank you, all.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng: Hi, good morning, guys.
John Christmann: Good morning, Paul.
Paul Cheng: John, two quick questions.
John Christmann: Okay.
Paul Cheng: First, the second quarter effective tax rate on the adjusted operating earnings seems small. Was there any one-off item in there or what contributed to that - seems like less than 30% effective tax rate? Secondly, I just curious, I mean, I think a lot of people will argue you [ph] still have too many operators in the US shale. We don't need all the operators. So, wondering that, for Apache, does it make sense that for you to trying to find a company with the nearby land possession and form a vast scale joint venture and put everything together? Everyone still have the equity ownership, so no one paying any equity premium to anyone, but that - by doing in this way, you can drive much better efficiency and cost improvement than individually, perhaps that the company could be able to do so. Is that something that you guys would entertain or you think that doesn't make sense for our Apache?
John Christmann: Yeah, I will Steve address the effective tax rate question first, and then I'll come back to your - the second part.
Stephen Riney: Yeah. Paul, if - I think I understand the question around the effective tax rate, as your recall, we have put a 100% valuation allowance on the tax benefit of our net operating loss carry forward in the US on the balance sheet. You normally carry a deferred tax asset on the balance sheet, and we've put a complete valuation allowance on that reducing that asset on the balance sheet to zero, even though we do have a pretty significant tax, net operating loss, carry forward. And what we do in periods of time like this in the second quarter, when we have book income in the US, and we would normally recognize a tax expense, we release enough of that valuation allowance just to offset the tax expense for that quarter. And you'll see that, you'll see the $60 million in our non-GAAP reconciliation from net income to adjusted earnings in that in the appendix in our supplement. So that'll have the effect of lowering the effective tax rate quite a bit.
Paul Cheng: I see. So as long as that we have discount commodity prices and US is earning a fair amount, we should assume that the effective tax rate will be substantially lower than what, say, under more normal tax waiver suggests?
Stephen Riney: Correct.
Paul Cheng: Okay. That will do. Thank you.
John Christmann: Paul, your second question, it really just boils down to value. I mean, I think the nice thing about our assets, we've got high working interest. We now have two rigs operating in the Permian. I think it boils down to scale, efficiency and value added. And in some areas that could make a lot of sense, some areas it may not make sense. But we're open to looking at things, as is always the case but today, I think we like where we are, we like to pace, we like what we're doing. I think our wells are very competitive and performance is very strong. And I think we're putting attention on the right assets within our portfolio today for us.
Paul Cheng: Alright. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from a line of Gail Nicholson with Stephens.
Gail Nicholson: Good morning. When you guys - when discussed about Alpine, with the scenarios you laid out and keeping now equivalent volumes flat, is it fair to assume that Alpine potentially gets more capital in the '22 forward timeframe? And how - can you just talk about the five DUCs that you're completing and how those compare to previous wells?
John Christmann: Yeah, I'll let Dave touch on the DUC performance on those. And as Steve outlined, Gail, it's holding BOEs flat, but we actually going to be growing oil and offsetting some of the gas, so in those cases. So I'll let Steve handle that and then Dave, you can talk about the Alpine DUCs.
Stephen Riney: Yeah, Gail. So just to be clear, again, we're not trying to say what exactly our capital program is going to be in 2022 and beyond. The hypothetical case that we used did not contain funding of additional drilling in Alpine High, so it's more oil focused than gas focused. Thus, gas volumes going down into the future, oil volumes going up. But we look at that all of the time, certainly with gas and NGL prices improving in the recent months, and could continue to improve. That'll be something that we will evaluate. And as we finish up this year and roll into next year, we'll get into the actual capital program for 2022, which very well could include some capital for Alpine High.
David Pursell: Hi. Yeah, and Gail on the performance, so we've completed seven DUCs, just to level set, two early in the program and five, kind of, more in the mid of the program. The wells - I think all the wells are meaningfully outperforming our expectations and prior well results for offset wells that we would have completed in the 2019 timeframe. So, very excited about the results. The last - the most recent five, still early, they're producing - they've cleaned up and they're producing well, but we want to continue to watch the performance curve before we probably spiked the ball.
Gail Nicholson: Great. And then just on the exploration front, there's a tremendous amount of potential on Suriname, but you've also had success in other areas like the tertiary in the North Sea [indiscernible] that you'd disclosed earlier this year. I'm just wondering how you guys are thinking about exploration outside of Suriname over the next couple of years?
John Christmann: Tracey, I'll let you.
Tracey Henderson: Hi, Gail. I think, we are very excited about Suriname, as you mentioned, and I think we will be looking for other opportunities. I think we are in a very opportunity rich environment for exploration. So, it's early days. I've been with Apache now just right at two months. So, you'll hear more about that, as we go forward. But definitely, we'll be looking at other opportunities.
Gail Nicholson: Great, thanks, guys and excellent quarter.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with KeyBanc.
Leo Mariani: Hi, guys. Just wanted to follow up a little bit on Suriname here, you guys mentioned that you're in the process of picking up a rig to drill a well, Apache operated on Block 53. Just wanted to kind of get a little bit more information about that? Is this kind of a mandatory well to hold the block? Is this kind of a one-off exploration well, as you folks see it? And I guess, is it just kind of a short-term rig deal as result and what will be the rough capital net to Apache to go and execute that?
John Christmann: Yeah, Leo, we've actually got one rig or one well required to continue to hold the block. And so, we've got to spread well by June of next year and we're excited about that. I think there's a lot of prospectivity in Block 53. In terms of where you looking - where the costs are going today, well costs are probably going to be close to 100 million would be my guess, for gross, and we've got about 45% working interest in there. But I'll let Tracy talk a little bit about what we see exploration wise, as we've got both slope and more of a deepwater setting Block 53, like we did at Block 58.
Tracey Henderson: Yeah, leveraging on what John just said we - it's certainly not a one-off exploration or seen as a mandatory well. I think what we've learned is an incredible amount with the exploration wells that we've drilled across 58. And the petroleum systems within the basin continues right into Block 53. So, we're actually very excited and we see some prospectivity that's very analogous to what we've been drilling in Block 58 and what we've just seen with some of the recent appraisal wells. I think we've learned a lot and those learnings will be leveraged into what we see in Block 53, because we do see very analogous systems.
Leo Mariani: Okay. That's helpful color. And I guess, just given kind of the substantial plans that are existing in Block 58, which I assume is going to involve at least a couple rigs every year for the next several years. And I know you have to get a well done by June, but can you give us a sense of, if you are successful here in Block 53, is this kind of just another leg of the stool where this can kind of be a block that has concurrent activity over the next couple years in parallel with Block 58. How do you think about the success case here?
John Christmann: Well, I mean, the nice thing is we've got two partners here, we've got 45%. So I think it gives us a lot of optionality, as we start to think about it. We are the operator at Block 53. We did do the joint venture and handed over operations in Block 58 to Total. But I think it just builds up more optionality and more flexibility for us to look for different ways to continue to advance some longer term very meaningful programs.
Leo Mariani: Okay, that's helpful. I guess, just lastly, on this potential for the third rig that you talked about here, obviously you decided to add some activity in Egypt. And I think you guys have strongly alluded to the fact that a third rig can kind of show up in the Permian. Just trying to get a sense of what's kind of the decision point there? Is it really just about sustained higher commodity prices in the year end, and if that occurs, is that third rig pretty much kind of coming for next year to try to hold BOEs flat with oil up and gas down a little?
John Christmann: No, we have not made a decision on the third rig. I want to make it really clear. It's not in the budget this year. I think it's important because we've been under investing below sustaining levels to kind of articulate what it would take and as Steve said in his prepared remarks, we're prioritizing debt pay down in the balance sheet first, which is why we've been under investing, but the third rig would be required to get to a sustaining level in the US. And so we've got pretty attractive options for that, so that's why that's framed that way. But it is not whether - it's not a foregone conclusion that we're bringing it, we have not made that call and cap remains at the $1.1 billion for 2021.
Leo Mariani: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.
Jeoffrey Lambujon: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is just to follow up on US upstream. Obviously, throughout the first half year, US volumes have been more than offsetting the planned and unplanned international downtown, which we've seen more about in the full year guide as well, even net of the CBP sales. So, just hoping you could talk more about what you've been seeing in non-Alpine High Permian, in other words, through the first half of the year, and how that might influence capital allocation within non- Alpine High Permian specifically?
David Pursell: Yeah. Jeff, this is Dave. Good, thanks for the question. We're seeing meaningful uplift in our performance on the on the Permian DUCs outside of Alpine as well. And it's - we're optimizing on a number of different variables. We're excited about that program. And so when we - I think Steve talked about it in his prepared remarks, when we look at our US portfolio, we have multiple places where they could compete for the capital for that third rig and that would be the Chalk, it could be in third rig in the oily Permian and possibly the third rig in Alpine. So, we're evaluating those, but we're very excited about the performance that we've seen and the improvements that we continue [Technical Difficulty].
Jeoffrey Lambujon: Got it. Thank you. And then second, just to try on the Egypt PSC modernization, and understand you can't speak to specific terms. Is there anything you can share at this time, maybe just on what mechanics are in flux that will help to increase capital allocation to that region?
John Christmann: No, I mean, I think you just got to look at it in terms of modernizing. We've got a lot of concessions. We will be collapsing those. Merger and joint ventures, I mean, there's a lot to do there administratively that's going to make it easier and it will effectively keep us from trapping capital. But we're not in a position to elaborate more than that today. It's going through the approval process and we should be in a position to talk about it later this year, for sure.
Jeoffrey Lambujon: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Pickering Energy.
David Heikkinen: Good morning, guys, and thanks for the hypothetical framework, it is helpful, and we won't hold you to it for your budget. One of the things that we're curious about him, on the gas side, have you all thought about joining any of the, like, oil and gas methane partnerships or certifying your natural gas or moving in any that direction to really quantify the improvements you're showing around emissions?
John Christmann: Yeah, I think we're a member of One Future. I think, well, our approach has been to take real tangible projects and steps that we can take. We're in the middle right now of working on our sustainability report, which will be coming out later in the year, like we always do, and so we're monitoring all those things. I think the key for us is trying to focus on what are the material things we can do in our business, that are going to lower those emissions, and drive performance, right. And so those are the things we're focused on.
David Heikkinen: And as you think about your operations globally, would you move towards quantifying carbon equivalent emissions per barrel for the North Sea, Egypt or US operations?
John Christmann: I think we will stay tuned and monitor where things are going. I mean, for us, we recognize we need to continue to lower our footprint. We need to be in a position and continue to monitor and measure those and take those steps. And then we'll just be making the - determining how - what's the best way to show it, and the best way to quantify it and also how to attack it. In the end, it's about lowering emissions.
David Heikkinen: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. I'll turn the call back to John Christmann.
John Christmann: Thank you. So before ending today's call, I'd like to leave you with three points; the first two of which are important catalysts. First, we're very encouraged with the progress in Suriname and look forward to having further results later this year. Second, the PSC modernization in Egypt will have an immediate positive impact for both the country and APA, and we are very pleased with how things are progressing. Finally, the free cash flow capacity of our base business is robust and sustainable, and this will materialize in returns to investors. Thank you for participating in our call today. Operator, over to you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-06 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day. And thank you for standing by. And welcome to the APA First Quarter 2021 Earnings Announcement Webcast Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker’s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President for Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.
Gary Clark: Good morning. And thank you for joining us on APA Corporation's first quarter 2021 financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results and 2021 outlook. Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President, Development, will also be available on the call to answer questions. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 15 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our first quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. This quarter, we have also introduced the term free cash flow, which is defined on page 20 in the glossary of our supplement. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I'll turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. In my prepared remarks, I will review APA Corporation's first quarter results and discuss our 2021 priorities. Despite some significant weather-related challenges, we delivered a strong first quarter. Specifically, our free cash flow generation was over $500 million. We performed well relative to our production and cost expectations, and our safety performance was excellent. Our total adjusted production exceeded guidance as Permian oil and gas volumes benefited from a faster-than-expected recovery from the February storm impacts. This more than offset lower international adjusted volumes resulting from the impact of higher oil prices on our Egypt PSC cost recovery barrels and some extended operational downtime in the North Sea. Upstream capital investment and LOE were considerably below guidance for the quarter. Together with strong price realizations, these factors contributed to an exceptional quarter of free cash flow generation, all of which is being designated for debt reduction. Looking ahead, the full year guidance we provided in February is unchanged, and we are clearly off to a good start. Turning now to operations in the United States. We reactivated a rig in the Permian Basin, which was previously on standby and picked up one additional rig to drill a 4-well program in the Austin Chalk play of Texas in Brazos and Washington counties. We placed 22 wells online in the Permian, including two at Alpine High. Roughly 5,000 BOEs per day of lower-margin Permian production remains shut in at the end of the first quarter. We are very pleased with the early results and combined with the recovery from Winter Storm Uri are expecting a significant increase in second and third quarter production. On Tuesday, we announced an agreement in principle with the Ministry of Petroleum and the Egyptian General Petroleum Company to modernize the terms of our current production sharing contracts, which is the result of a process that has been underway for more than one year. The agreement is comprehensive, and when ratified by parliament, will result in increased activity, capital investment and oil-focused production growth over the next several years. Currently, we are running a five-rig program in Egypt and continue to build quality inventory across our expanded acreage footprint. In the first quarter, we had another significant oil discovery at our Hadid prospect, the details of which are in our financial and operational supplement. We are projecting Egypt gross production will bottom in the second quarter and trend up in the second half of the year. Debottlenecking of certain pipelines of facilities and the addition of compression capacity will enable us to connect roughly 35 wells in the second half of the year compared to only 20 wells during the first half. These and other 2021 guidance items do not include any potential changes associated with the pending PSC modernization, which we look forward to updating after the agreement is formally approved. In the North Sea, we have been operating one floating rig and one platform rig crew for just over a year. At this pace, we are capable of delivering annual production in the range of 55,000 to 60,000 BOE per day for the next several years. In 2021, we anticipate North Sea volumes will be a bit lower as we experienced unplanned compressor downtime in the 40s field during the first quarter and will incur extended pipeline downtime and platform maintenance turnarounds during the second and third quarters. Following this, however, we expect a sharp rebound in production during the fourth quarter 2021. In January, we announced a discovery at our fourth exploration well in Suriname. An appraisal plan for this well, Keskesi is forthcoming. Total has now fully assumed operatorship of Block 58 and is running two rigs in the vicinity of the Sapakara discovery. Both rigs are capable of appraisal and exploration drilling, which provides ultimate flexibility as we execute our programs. We look forward to providing updates as appropriate in the future. Next, I would like to review our priorities for 2021, which we outlined previously on our February conference call. First, we are budgeting conservatively and focusing on free cash flow generation and debt reduction. This year, our reinvestment rate is currently tracking below 50%. Second, we are aggressively managing our cost structure, and we'll continue to do so regardless of the oil price environment. Third, we are preserving optionality within our portfolio, which will enable us to either develop or possibly monetize certain assets at the appropriate time. Fourth, we are advancing the exploration and appraisal programs in Suriname and are now beginning to benefit from our joint venture carry agreement, which is a very efficient funding source for our differential long-term opportunity in Block 58. Fifth, we are continuing to focus on value creation through organic exploration. We recently announced the hiring of Tracey Henderson to lead our exploration team, which concludes an extensive search that began prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tracey's experience and expertise are a great fit for the existing APA portfolio and we look forward to her leadership on future exploration strategy and ventures. And lastly, we are advancing ESG initiatives that are relevant, impactful and core to our business. Broadly defined these fall into three areas of emphasis, air, water, and communities and people. In 2021, we have established goals that address routine flaring, freshwater consumption and diversity and inclusion programs. These goals are linked to the annual incentive compensation of not just management, but all employees. We made excellent progress in each of these areas during the first quarter and I look forward to discussing them further as we progress these efforts through the year. In closing, I would like to thank all of our employees across the globe for their hard work in the first quarter And in particular, our field personnel and contractors on the front lines that did an excellent job of safely navigating global pandemic protocols as well as some very extreme weather events. During the historic freeze in Texas, our teams worked around the clock to maintain and restore the hydrocarbon production systems that are vitally important to ensuring the safety and well-being of people and communities during events such as this. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on the first quarter and our 2021 outlook.
Stephen Riney: Thanks, John. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported first quarter 2021 consolidated net income of $388 million or $1.02 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which is a $43 million valuation allowance adjustment for deferred taxes in the quarter. Excluding this and other smaller items, the adjusted net income was $346 million or $0.91 per share. We had a very good first quarter with most financial results being in line or better than our previous guidance. Notable exceptions were North Sea production, which John addressed; and G&A expense, which was $83 million. While underlying spend was in line with our guidance of around $75 million, additional charges were recognized for the mark-to-market impact on certain stock compensation programs. First quarter results were significantly influenced by U.S. natural gas pricing volatility associated with Winter Storm Uri. The impacts of the storm appear in several places on the income statement. So let me take you through most of the significant items. Since it determines the reporting of results, I'll first remind everyone of how we handle Permian Basin gas production. We sell all of our gas production in basin, and then manage our long-haul transport obligations separately. We optimize those obligations through the purchase, transport and sale of gas from various receipt points in the Permian Basin and in the Gulf Coast areas. Our common practice as we contract for the purchase and sale of gas is to maintain a relatively balanced exposure between gas daily and first-of-month pricing. As the end of January approach, we had a portfolio of purchase and sales contracts that were heavily skewed to February first-of-month pricing. As we commonly do when this is the case, we use financial contracts to rebalance that exposure closer to 50-50. So given the unusually high gas price spike that occurred in mid-February, this impacted first quarter reporting of results in three ways: first, our underlying sales contracts for produced gas determine the reporting of revenue and realizations. Since approximately half of our underlying sales contracts for February production were at gas daily pricing, you will see a significant increase in both natural gas revenues on the income statement and in the average realized price for U.S. gas for the quarter. Second, our underlying contracts also determine the reporting of revenues and costs associated with our activities to purchase, transport and sell gas to fulfill our transportation obligations. The results of these activities appear in the lines entitled, Purchased Oil and Gas Sales and Purchased Oil and Gas Costs on our P&L. Combined, we incurred a loss of $54 million on that activity in the first quarter, which includes the cost of the transport and the fuel associated with that transport. In a normal quarter, given current differentials, we would expect this loss to be in the $25 million to $35 million range. For the first quarter, this loss was compounded by a volume imbalance in our underlying purchase and sale contracts, which resulted in more gas purchased at the higher February daily prices and more sales at the lower first-of-month pricing. Finally, since we used the financial swap to rebalance our underlying contract portfolio, a good portion of the price spike benefit appears in the $158 million derivative instrument gain on the income statement. If our underlying contract portfolio had been more balanced in the first place, we would not have used the derivative contract, and we would not have this gain. Instead, we would have reported higher gas revenues and a lower loss on sales of purchased gas. I know I went through that quickly, and it can be confusing. If you have further questions, please call Gary's team and they can take you through it in further detail. Free cash flow was also strong in the first quarter, exceeding $500 million. That cash is being used for debt reduction, initially, through the pay down of our revolver. Excluding the consolidated effects of Altus Midstream, we reduced net debt by $339 million in the quarter, mostly through the retention of cash. If the current price environment holds up, we anticipate at least $1 billion of net debt reduction in 2021. Turning now to some additional comments around our 2021 outlook. Our full year 2021 production, capital, LOE and G&A guidance all remain unchanged. Assuming the recently announced PSC modernization in Egypt proceeds on course, we anticipate adding some capital activity in Egypt for the second half of 2021. We will update our guidance for Egypt as we proceed through that approval process. We have also expanded our guidance to include the anticipated effects of purchasing and selling gas in the U.S. to fulfill our transport obligations, which I discussed previously. Lastly, for the remainder of the year, we expect our U.S. natural gas realizations will closely approximate Waha and El Paso Permian pricing. You will find all of our current guidance items in the financial and operational supplement. In closing, we look forward to a very strong year of free cash flow generation of at least $1 billion. This should take us a good bit of the way toward our previously mentioned leverage target of around 1.5 times debt-to-EBITDA under a mid-cycle pricing scenario. You should understand, however, that our more relevant objective is to return to investment-grade credit status. To that end, we will continue to budget conservatively, focus on costs, free cash flow generation and debt reduction and maintain close contact with the rating agencies to ensure that we are taking the appropriate steps to achieve that goal in a timely manner. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Freeman from Raymond James. Sir, your line is open.
John Freeman: Good morning, guys.
John Christmann: Good morning, John.
John Freeman: The first question I had was just on what Steve said there at the end about potentially looking when the new PSC has done in Egypt about adding some additional capital and activity in the second half of '21 in Egypt. And obviously, that's consistent with what you've said in the past, John, about eventually wanting to get the U.S. and Egypt, and 2022 and beyond is sort of more of a maintenance level activity at the least. And so I know in the past, the sort of the commentary around Egypt had been from the five rigs you're currently running, probably wanting to get to at least a couple of rigs more to at least get to that maintenance level. So until told otherwise by you all, is that a fair assumption to assume that, that's kind of where you want to get to in Egypt for the - by year-end?
John Christmann: Yeah. I'll make a few comments on - just in general on Egypt, and then I'll have Dave step in a little bit in terms of just rig count and things. But I think what you've seen is, finally, we can get out in the public about a real important step in the process that we've been working through and modernizing our PSCs in Egypt. This is something that we started really prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. But I will tell you, we've been negotiating in good faith and in earnest with Egypt since -- for more than a year. And we're at a point today where after working with the Minister of Petroleum as well as EGPC, we were able to announce this on Tuesday. It's really a framework that sets the future for Egypt. We've been clear not to touch guidance this year. We've now had to go through the approval process, and there are some steps to go through the parliamentary process and ultimately get things ratified, and then we'll be able to talk more about it. But as we go through the year, we will be picking up some activity. There's just a lot of projects in Egypt that had been - become non-competitive because of the terms of the PSC, and this is really going to open up some projects that we're ready to fund. I think this is going to be a win-win for both the country of Egypt and Apache, and it's going to really put us on a much stronger than just maintenance curve for Egypt. So Dave, I'll let you jump in and add a little bit more to that.
David Pursell: Yeah. Thanks. Let's step back. And I think, John, you had - you framed your question on what we've said before around wanting to maintain the business. So let's think about maintenance capital. So right now, we're going to spend this year roughly around -- these are going to be round numbers - $900 million of development capital. And that's -- and in that mode, production's in a modest decline. So we think about two places we'd want to flex capital to arrest that decline, that would be in the U.S. in the Permian Basin, primarily, and in Egypt. If you think about a rig line, we've talked about needing potentially a full rig line or a partial rig line in addition to the two we'll have in the second half of this year in the Permian to sustain production and then more rigs in Egypt. And we've talked about seven to eight rigs needed to sustain or maintain production there. And so if you think about a rig line in the Permian and a handful of rigs in Egypt, that puts you roughly $200 million incremental dollars. So our maintenance capital is about $1.1 billion. And the key here is we're not talking about material growth, but we're talking about maintaining production. And that gives us some optionality in the portfolio to where we want to add that capital to maintain our global production. And so that frames the maintenance capital, and I'll throw it over to Steve to add some more color on that.
Stephen Riney: Yeah. So we entered, I think, good context for this is that we entered the year as people will recall, it seems like years ago, but ended this year with a plan that was based on $45 WTI, and it had a - as Dave called it, the development capital, the $900 million of development capital, if we just set aside Suriname, was about a 60% reinvestment rate. And at current strip, that same amount of capital is less than a 40% reinvestment rate. So clearly, this is not a reinvestment rate that's going to sustain, and it's not a maintenance level of capital spending. And so we've got a continued slight decline in production volumes. And we've talked about this in the past, that the #1 priority coming into the year when it still looked like a pretty difficult year was that we needed to get debt paid down. We needed to get the balance sheet strengthened an we needed to star the process and that was the most important financial priority. But it is prudent [ph] to spend at of maintenance capital level and maintain the production volume going forward and we probably need somewhere in the neighbourhood of $100 million to $200 million more development capital in order to get into that neighbourhood. And with price where they are, and if they hold up, I think we’re likely to start increasing capital in the second half in order to get that point and most of that is Dave outlined is going to be in the Permian and Egypt, especially Egypt with the modernization efforts as that proceeds and gets the final approval. And I just want to echo on that. The issue there was the old structure of the PSCs and how they work. These were very old vintage PSC structures. And it has nothing to do with the fact that Egypt actually has some very highly economic opportunities in quite a bit of them and just needed the PSC structure that enabled the capital investment in that. And I'll just echo once again John's point that none of this is in our guidance. It's not in the capital for guidance nor is it in the production volume or anything else for guidance. And just to reinforce what Dave said, I'd ask that we please don't throw us into the bucket of growthers [ph] because this is not an aggressive growth spending plan. This is just about a prudent step towards getting to at least a maintenance level of capital spending.
John Freeman: I appreciate that. That makes a lot of sense. Just the follow-up related sort of tied to that is I see what sort of the activity has been in Suriname onto the first half of the year were Total made the decision to focus more on appraisal here in the first half of the year as opposed to immediately taking that second rig up to Bonboni for the exploration program. And I guess we'll just wait to see when we ultimately get up to Bonboni. But at the very least, it seems like just given that you are on the hook for 12.5% on appraisal versus 50% on exploration, it seems like that created a little bit of slack in the budget, unless I'm reading too much into it. There's at least a little slack because just by definition, it seems like your Suriname on budget from where you started the year is probably a touch lower just given the -- a little bit more of a skew toward appraisal versus exploration at least through the first half of the year.
John Christmann: Yes. And I guess, John, we look at the Suriname budget, we really haven't touched that, right? I mean it's just a timing thing. Bonboni will be the next exploration well. We're obviously anxious to go drill it. And it is 45 kilometers to the north, so it's -- to give you an idea just the scale and scope. So we aren't shifting dollars there, consuming any of that. We've left the Suriname budget kind of where it is. That's just a kind of timing. And quite frankly, we had a pretty good idea what their cadence was going to be as we entered this year anyways.
John Freeman: Great. Well, I appreciate it, guys.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Sir, your line is open.
Doug Leggate: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I'm afraid I'm going to pound John a little bit on Egypt, just to round out the last John's questions. Steve, I wonder - I know you're going to give us details later on, but I just wonder if I could touch on a couple of aspects of why this could be a big deal for you guys. I think it's 10 years since we published our primer on this, believe it or not. The cost pool, the potential for extension and the implications of that seismic shoot you've been doing, particularly over the oil play in the Western Desert, can you offer any - can you quantify perhaps what no ring fencing can do to the cost recovery or the cost that you have outstanding there and whether you would get an extension on those concessions as part of this agreement?
John Christmann: No, I mean, Doug, great question. And you'll have to just wait until we get things finally approved for us to really dive in and give any - a lot of details on it. But I'll just say, we - stepping back, it's a holistic approach. This is something that will be good for Egypt. We've looked at things very carefully. This has been a process that has been very lengthy and very thorough and very comprehensive. And it really is in line with the minister's objective of modernizing the oilfield in Egypt. And I think it's going to have some benefits that's going to enable us to direct more dollars into the drilling programs and into the volumes, which are going to generate more revenue. And so we've got a deep inventory. We're seeing good early results off of the seismic with the Hadid announcement that we had this - within the supplement this go-around. So we're excited about Egypt. And quite frankly, this really puts us in a position where we can fund some projects that are ready to go.
Doug Leggate: Forgive me for getting technical on this, John, but I just want to make sure you understand my question. Do you have isolated cost recovery pools that you couldn't recover because they were ring-fenced? And I'm just trying to understand if you could - your share of production could go up sort of overnight as a consequence of being able to tap into those cost recovery pools without any incremental capital
John Christmann: I fully understood your question. I'll just say again, I can't get into a lot of details until we close. But this is going to be a win-win for both us and Egypt, and it's going to let us put more dollars in the ground and raise out investments. Steve, do you want to?
Stephen Riney: Yes. I'd just say, Doug, we applaud and respect the effort. We just can't get into details because it's still got quite a bit of process to go. But we've made a major milestone here with the agreement in principle, and so we're on our way. And I'd just like to reiterate, Egypt is a fantastic country to do business in and it's got some of the best underlying opportunity in our entire portfolio and long legs on that inventory as we're proving with the seismic and some of the activity going on, on the exploration side. And all we're accomplishing with this is the -- is getting rid of an old, outdated PSC structure that created artificial barriers, to being able to access some of that really attractive opportunity. We'll give a lot more details as we get closer to this.
Doug Leggate: Okay. I don't want to hold the call guys. That was actually my first question. My second one, I won't go to Suriname this time, but I'd like to ask you, Steve, about free cash flow. Look, obviously, $500 million adjusting for working capital, $1 billion for the year that current. There is some something not adding up there. I just wonder if you could just frame for us what you think the scale of the more than $1 billion could look like. And more importantly, in a relatively complex portfolio in some people's view, what's the longevity, ex Suriname, of sustaining that free cash flow from the current portfolio? And I'll leave it at that. Thanks.
Stephen Riney: Yes. Great, Doug. And I think that I was probably a bit too understated in my prepared remarks. And the point of that was really just to highlight where we've gotten to in one quarter from the plan that we laid out to all of you in February. Our original plan, as I said, we report at $45 WTI. It had somewhere around $350 million of free cash flow. And the point of the - of my prepared remarks was to just indicate that it's over $1 billion now. And maybe I could do a little bit better than that and say that at the current strip, it will be well over $1 billion. We - the only thing I would say about that, though, is we don't give guidance on free cash flow. We haven't done that in the past. And I don't want to start that process on an iterative basis at this point, mainly because there are so many different measures out there of what people call free cash flow. And we've defined what ours is, so we're very clear about that. But we're going to continue not to give guidance on it. And the second thing I would say is, if I go back to my comments earlier around maintenance capital, on the -- if you just set Suriname aside, we're somewhere -- and yet, we continue to invest $200 million in Suriname, you only need about 100 -- somewhere between $100 million and $200 million more to get to a maintenance level of capital on the development side. So we're not far from that. And then -- and so that's what your difference is, it requires $100 million to $200 million more in order to sustainably access this, what I would call well over $1 billion of free cash flow, in this price environment for an extended period of time. And I think what we've shared in the past is that we certainly are confident we can do that for five to 10 years, and we're always looking for opportunities to be able to do that for an extended period of time beyond that.
Doug Leggate: Steve, that's really helpful. I mean Suriname's in the stock [ph] for free, and I appreciate the answer.
Stephen Riney: Thanks for the question. Gave me the opportunity to be a little less conservative on the free cash flow.
Doug Leggate: That’s appreciated, guys. Thanks so much.
John Christmann: Thank you, Doug.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Scialla from Stifel. Sir, your line is open.
Michael Scialla: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. John, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about potential non-core sales. I just wanted to see if you could talk about that anymore, maybe what assets might be included there and how far along in the process are you. Is there a formal data room planned for that? Or where are you in that process?
John Christmann: Mike, thanks for the question. Yes, we typically wait to talk about portfolio transactions and things after we've announced them and so forth. So -- but I don't think it's a big secret. We've had a pretty small package in the Permian that's in the market. It's non-core, some higher cost waterflood-type stuff that we may be in a position to transact on, we'll see. We're kind of working through that now. I think the point is we've got the rig running in the chalk. We're open to looking at what we will and will not be investing in. And as we make progress on things like modernization in Egypt, it's a continual process for us. So a lot of key things going on, but we're open and always looking at various things with the portfolio.
Michael Scialla: Okay. Thanks. And I wanted to ask on Suriname, just kind of a follow-up on the deeper test at Keskesi. You ran into the pressuring issues before you could test the Neocomian. I think you said in your release, it nevertheless helped validate your geologic model. I just want to see if you could add any color on that and what you saw in that process.
John Christmann: Well, with Keskesi, there were a couple of things that happened there that I think were key. Number one, we got down below the unconformity. I think, number -- and proved that we had charge in hydrocarbons. I mean, that's obviously why we had to stop. And then the other key fact that was important was at that depth, we proved that we could have quality reservoir in those carbonates. And so -- and it also was very, very rich hydrocarbon, not just a dry gas. So we're encouraged by that. It's a prospect and a play that's going to need to be tested. But it's also going to take a different well design than what we had. We were very close to getting down to the first target. There were two targets that we're going after. But we had to call it early and we did. But that's something we'll be working with our partner, Total, on to come back with an exploration well that will test those Neocomian targets at a later date, because both of us were encouraged by what we had seen leading up to getting very close to the first target.
Michael Scialla: Great. Thanks, John,
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Ma’am you line is open.
Jeanine Wai: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions.
John Christmann: Good morning, Jeanine.
Jeanine Wai: Good morning. Thanks for the time. Maybe just two quick ones on the balance sheet. Can you talk about the medium-term plan for adjusting the balance sheet? You've got a ton of free cash flow on the horizon, so there's a lot of options there. Do you intend to retire debt as it comes due? Or are there opportunities to retire or further refinance at lower rates earlier?
Stephen Riney: Yeah. Jeanine, so this is Steve. Yes, we've talked about the fact that we are -- we've talked externally about -- we're targeting at least getting down to 1.5 times debt to EBITDA. We may need to move lower than that. Certainly, the direction things have been moving in general over time. We believe something at or below that number is going to be what's required to get back to investment grade. And as I said in my prepared remarks, that's ultimately the real underlying goal, is to get back to investment grade, and we're going to do whatever it takes to do that. We're clearly making some tremendous progress this year by our estimation at the current strip. We'll have net debt-to-EBITDA down to approaching 2, about 2.1 times debt-to-EBITDA at the end of this year. Even if you adjusted that to -- well, what would happen if we were in a $55 price environment for 2022, we'd still only be slightly higher than the 2.1, maybe 2.2 or 2.3. So it doesn't move up considerably. So we're - we've made tremendous progress or will make tremendous progress this year if prices hold up. As far as how we're going to do that, we haven't gotten into the details of exactly how we're going to do that. But it obviously has to result in paying off some of the bonds historically. What we've generally said is we're going to do it the same way we've done it in the past. We've done combinations of open market repurchases. We've done 10b5-1s. We've done tender offers, refinances, and we will do all of the above. I don't believe -- at this point in time, I don't believe you'll see a material amount of refinances going forward until we get to -- back to investment grade. We've got about a little over $335 million of debt maturing in the next couple of years, and that will just be paid down as it matures.
Jeanine Wai: And so maybe following up on, so the ultimate goal is to get back to investment-grade. How do you view that versus more meaningfully increasing the dividend? Or are those two things kind of mutually exclusive? Or do you think you can do both of them the same time?
Stephen Riney: Yes. I - obviously, both of those are important. I think we have to get the balance sheet in order and get debt down and get at least at a minimum, get back closer to a point where we think achieve investment grade before we start looking at the dividend again. And as we've discussed before and I think we've talked with you specifically about it, we look at debt paydown as a return to shareholders because every dollar of debt that we can get off the balance sheet today will add more than $1 to the market cap of the company, we believe, because we think that the debt level is actually weighing on the share price. And so while it's not the same as a dividend and we recognize that, it does benefit shareholders directly with debt paydown. And we haven't made any specific plans as to what we're going to do. We've got quite a bit still to accomplish on the debt paydown effort. We - as I said, we'll accomplish quite a bit of that, hopefully, this year. We'll need to do more of it in 2022. And at an appropriate time, we'll reconsider whether we need to bring the dividend back or whether we want to start bringing the dividend back and we'll certainly hold out the option that we could start looking at the dividend prior to actually getting investment grade. That is clearly an option for us.
Jeanine Wai: Thank you for all the detail. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you, Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Sir, your line is open.
Charles Meade: Good morning, John to you and the rest of your team there.
John Christmann: Good morning, Charles.
Charles Meade: I wondered if I could go back to Egypt and just ask a question -- I think I know the answer. But in principle -- I recognize you can't talk about the details yet. But in principle, are we talking about that there's some opportunities that are obvious to you and obvious to Egypt, but it's also obvious to Egypt that you're not pursuing them because of the -- maybe some oil price thresholds that are quite low in those PSCs, and so that's the win for them? Do I have the right framework?
John Christmann: Yes. I'll just say that there were some projects that the PSC was making them less competitive, right? And by modernizing the PSCs, there's projects that move up the queue that we can fund, and we'll be looking forward to fund. So there's no doubt it's a critical step. And this is not -- it's not uncommon. You got to understand these PSCs, we've been in Egypt for over 2.5 decades now. A lot of these fields have been operated since the mid-90s. And so stepping back and going through this, this is just the evolution that's required in an oilfield, right? So.
Charles Meade: Yes. That's right. I imagine if you'd ask the people who had written them, if they were going to stand for all time, they would have said absolutely no. But If I can ask the second question about -- you mentioned in your prepared remarks and you guys put out a press release about bringing Tracey Henderson on to head up our your exploration. So she has some experience drilling offshore Suriname. And I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about more -- a little more about where you see her getting rubber to the road or really helping your process both in near term and the long term. I know that you're still the operator of Block 53, if I'm not mistaken. So that's one obvious place in the near term. But can you talk a little bit about how you expect her to fit in and contribute?
John Christmann: Well, I mean, I think it's all about building the executive leadership team that we want for long term. And Tracey brings a wealth of experience and a wonderful skill set. She's worked in small publicly traded companies, so she understands where they had to explore for a living. I think she'll bring a lot of expertise, a lot of experience. She's built exploration teams. I think we've got a lot of key pieces here that she'll be able to come in and hit the ground running and work with, and a portfolio that fits a lot of her expertise. So she was absolutely our #1 candidate, and we're thrilled to ever join us.
Charles Meade: Thank you for that color John.
John Christmann: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson from Stephens. Ma’am your line is open.
Gail Nicholson: Good morning. We came in slightly below guide for 1Q. Can you talk about the drivers here and the ability to replicate any of those 1Q savings going forward?
Clay Bretches: Yeah, Gail, this is Clay Bretches. And with regard to the LOE, it was just a masterful performance by our operations folks in the field. They did a great job. They understood the task that was at hand. Last year, we went through some significant cost-cutting exercises. We identified the areas where we could cut cost. We knew that those needed to be sustainable, especially when we were looking at commodity prices in 2020. So we had an all-hands-on-deck approach to this. There was a lot of bottoms-up initiatives that led to this LOE reduction. It wasn't short term. It wasn't just deferral of expenditures, maintenance, et cetera. There was some of that, but it wasn't significant. The big issues here in LOE reduction had to do with those initiatives that took place. If you take a look at where we had the most significant reductions, it was in the Permian. A lot of that had to do with the wells that we shut-in. We have a lot of wells that are what we call frequent flyers, wells that go down a lot. We took those out of service, and those are still shut-in because they cost us a lot of money and they're not economic to run. Furthermore, a lot of our waterflood properties that just weren't providing the economics, we went through and looked at these on a well-by-well, field-by-field basis, there's a lot of water that's not being injected right now because it's really expensive to inject that water. We still have approximately 300,000 barrels a day of water that we don't inject, which saves us a lot on electricity, a lot on maintenance, a lot on personnel overall. So in general, it's just the approach that we took. We want to maintain that. That's something that we talk about as an operations group on a regular basis. How do we maintain this low LOE profile as we go forward? In light of the fact that commodity prices are increasing, we do have concern about inflation and service costs. So we focus on making sure that we keep that LOE down, continue to strive to find initiatives that are going to keep the LOE down and flat in light of the fact that we know that there's going to be some inflationary pressures going forward. So really, again, just kudos to our operations team for getting us to where we are and maintaining those levels.
Gail Nicholson: Okay. I appreciate the clarity. And then just moving kind of on the ESG front. In regards to carbon capture, some of your North Sea peers are looking at carbon capture projects. Are you in the process of potentially doing anything in that vein? And/or do you see any potential for carbon capture of projects on your North Sea portfolio?
John Christmann: Yes. Gail, on the ESG front, we've emphasized there's really three areas. I mean we're focused on air, water, communities and people, right? And I think the key for us, too, is we're focused on near-term projects that we can do that can make an impact. And I think the area we're focused on right now mainly is flaring And in the -- basically in the U.S., where we're committed to eliminating our routine flaring by year-end this year as well as delivering less than 1% flaring intensity. So key goals there. We're looking at things in the North Sea. But as far as right now, the near-term things, we're looking at some of the low-hanging fruit that we can get after. I don't know if, Clay, you want to add anything on the carbon side in the North Sea.
Clay Bretches: No. Just what you said, obviously, there's a price on carbon in the North Sea, which creates opportunities. Anytime you have a price on carbon, that creates some economic incentives to study carbon capture. So we will take a look at that anywhere that we see a price on carbon. It is something that we were paying attention to in the North Sea. But like John said, what we're focused on right now from an ESG standpoint are those areas that we have control and which are going to be impactful for Apache. So the really big initiative for us from an ESG standpoint is to end our routine flaring in the U.S. onshore by the end of 2021. And we think this is really significant. You hear a lot of ESG claims out there that talk about some type of initiative that's aimed at 2030, 2040, 2050. What we're doing is saying we're going to end routine flaring by the end of this year. And we think that's really significant. And it represents a significant commitment by Apache to do the right thing and to produce responsibly. And we've shown that over and over. If you take a look at the investment that we have made in midstream solutions to make sure that we were performing responsibly, not only with Altus Midstream with those gathering and processing assets that we have in the Delaware Basin, but also our significant investment in the Gulf Coast Express pipeline, Permian Highway pipeline. Both of those are moving over four billion cubic feet of natural gas out of the Permian Basin that not only serves Apache, but it serves a basin in general. Getting that gas out of there and creating opportunities for others to get gas that otherwise would be flared out of the basin. So we've put a lot of investment in those pipes. We've put a lot of commitment in terms of firm transportation to anchor those pipes. So we feel like we're really doing a lot that impacts the gas flaring and ESG initiatives in real time.’
Gail Nicholson: Great. Thank you. Great quarter, looking for the back half of the year.
John Christmann: Thanks, Gail.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Sir, your line is open.
Paul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
John Christmann: Good morning, Paul.
Paul Cheng: Can I just get some maybe your intention for Egypt and Permian over the next several years. I mean we know that you -- most likely than not, that probably going to raise the activity level to into the sustaining level for those two areas. But over the next several years that are we going to trying to maintain them flat or that you were trying to grow a bit. And is that in any shape or form tied to your debt reduction target for that? How that decision-making or that type process is going to be? That's the first question. The second question is certainly, Total have indicated they will sanction the first development this year coming on stream in 2025. Any kind of color you can provide that which discovery is going to be target and whether that you will be doing similar to what Exxon did in these are one using a smaller ship sort of as an early production system, trying to learn the rest of -- learn the whole operation before you go to the [indiscernible] operation. Thank you
John Christmann: Well, thanks. Two good questions. I'd say, first of all, when we look at the portfolio, we've said for 2021, not to touch guidance or anything right now. So modernization in Egypt is going to have a big impact for us. It is going to enable us to put Egypt back on a track where we can grow those volumes, and I think it's going to be very beneficial. I think in Permian, we've got one rig running today. We're planning to pick up a second rig midyear. As David has said, we need to grab another rig there to kind of maintain our Permian volumes, and that would be an objective of ours But I think as we look going forward beyond that, we don't see trying to ramp up to a big activity pace and try to grow aggressively, that we think we want a modified moderate investment pace where we're investing very wisely and very -- making very capital -- efficient use of that capital. Your question on Suriname, clearly, we're underway with -- as Total as operator. They've got two rigs running in the vicinity of the Sapakara discovery. We have not put out any time lines, and I don't see a anything magical about when you need the FID a project. I think the key for us is doing the appraisal work collecting the data, so we can ultimately FID a project. There's lots of optionality. You are very likely looking at potential FPSOs like what's been done next door, but it's just really premature to get into anything there. I don't see anything magical about a year-end time line to make a first oil 2025. I think that could easily slide into next year and still make that type of time frame. So we're not pressing for any hurdle there. You want to do the work, you want to do it right, and then you want to be in a position to FID the projects when you're ready to FID the projects.
Paul Cheng: John, can I just go back into the first question that you said you're not going to increase the activity and trying to have a major growth. Is that a function to your debt reduction target that -- because you haven't reached that yet? Or that is just because you think the world doesn't need more oil even though the commodity price is strong.
Stephen Riney: No, I think -- Paul, I think in the short term, it's a function of needed debt reduction. But I think longer term, it's just in the -- it's part of the function of more cash flow for shareholders. And we've been in a position for quite some time that growth was not an objective that was worth chasing in and of itself. And that this business needs to be something that's returning cash to investors. We need to get the balance sheet fixed first in order to do that. As I mentioned earlier, we think reducing debt is a return to shareholders, just a different type. But longer term, when we get debt where it needs to be, we're not going to be looking for double-digit growth, but we're going to be returning cash to investors.
Paul Cheng: And Steve, I just want to -- reaffirm that. I think earlier, you guys said that you're going to add a rig in Egypt. That's not included in the current budget. And same as that for Permian, if you're trying to maintain as a flat production. So if we're going to do those, then that means that your overall capex for this year is going to be higher than $1.1 billion, right?
Stephen Riney: Yes. Let us be clear one more time maybe. We are not changing our guidance at this point in time. We just said that if prices hold up and we continue to make progress on the Egypt modernization, we may be looking at some further capital spending or capital activity in the second half of the year. If we were committed to doing that, we would be looking at contracting rigs and we would be telling you we're changing guidance, but we're not doing that right now.
Paul Cheng: Okay, perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani from KeyBanc. Sir, your line is open.
Leo Mariani: Yeah. Hey, guys. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on Egypt here. In terms of the Hadid discovery, can you maybe just give us a little bit more color around that? Is this something that rose out of the new concessions and new seismic that you folks shot? When do you see first production from that potential discovery here? And then additionally, do you think that this discovery unlocked a bunch of other drilling opportunities for you late this year and into 2022?
John Christmann: Yes, Leo, great question. It is a result of the new seismic. It was 2013 when we shot our last vintage, and then we started shooting this new seismic in really the '18, '19 still shooting process out there. It's given us more clarity where we can see things that are more subtle, and we're starting to move really from just drilling big bumps to things that have a stratigraphic element to them. This is a trend where it sets up multiple wells within the discovery area, but it also sets up very similar-looking prospects that look much like it. So it really gives you some insight into the lens we have now and the opportunity that we know sits out there that we now can start to crystallize as we continue to drill more wells off of the new seismic and refine that process. So on timing, I don't have that for you today. I can let - I think Clay can jump in on that on - actually on the Hadid well.
Clay Bretches: Yes. So Leo, this is Clay Bretches. And on the timing for the Hadid we're laying pipeline right now, and we're making sure that we have a pipeline that is sized for -- appropriately for the Hadid, but also for growth opportunities, just like what John said, based on follow-on wells in and around Hadid. And that pipeline is being laid right now and should be in service in the fourth quarter of this year.
Leo Mariani: Okay. That's helpful. I just want to jump over to the North Sea here. You guys certainly had some unplanned downtime in the first quarter, but you're also saying there's going to be -- it sounds like some more of that in the second quarter and then maybe some normal planned turnarounds in the third quarter. Could you give us a little bit color on how you see North Sea volumes progressing? Would you expect second quarter to go down further or would be more flat with first quarter? And then just kind of what's the cadence into third quarter? Is it down further? And I think you guys were saying that fourth quarter production should be up a lot. Just wanted to understand the cadence in the next few quarters.
John Christmann: Yes. I mean, it's all planned activity. Second and third quarter were, from the get-go, planned. It's pretty heavy maintenance periods. We were unable to do some of it last year, so they're going to be a little heavier this year. And then you're going to have a really strong rebound in Q4 as we bring everything back online. So I think the -- our guidance for the year is -- we reiterated that. And I don't know, Dave, is there anything else on shape or anything for Qs two and three for North Sea.
David Pursell: Yes. Just to reiterate what John said. The TARs [ph] in the second and third quarter, probably a little larger than normal because they were abbreviated last year because of COVID issues. So we'll see second and third quarter impacts, rough order of magnitude, those are kind of in the 6,500 barrel BOE per day range expected through the quarter for second and third quarter just on those impacts, and we'll see a rebound in the fourth quarter. So again, as John said, no change to guidance.
Leo Mariani: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from Truist Securities. Sir, your line is open.
Neal Dingmann: Thanks for squeezing me in guys. Just my last question, I don't know if there's anything about this, but I'm just wondering. We've seen a nice run continue not only in oil, but in gas. Any thoughts on potential incremental activity in Alpine this year or early next?
David Pursell: Yes. Neal, this is Dave Pursell. From an activity standpoint, we have five DUCs that we're completing as we speak. We completed two earlier in the year. We're going to evaluate the performance of those. But given where oil prices are, and we've got -- as we've talked about on this call, we have a constrained capital budget with oil in the 60s, it's hard for Alpine to compete with oilier capital in the Permian and in Egypt. So our view is let's evaluate the performance of the DUCs and then we'll decide or evaluate potential third-party capital.
Neal Dingmann: Sure. Makes a lot of sense. And then just lastly, quickly, are you seeing any just OFS, whether cost inflation, not only domestically, but I'm just curious, internationally, do you see much over on the two plays?
David Pursell: Yes. On well capital, so far, the answer is no. We would - we're looking for it. We'd anticipate it. We're looking at steel to see if we see inflation on the OCTG side of it. I think where we're feeling the inflation, and Clay talked about it on the LOE stuff, your basic operating chemicals and diesel costs. So we're seeing a little more real-time inflation on the -- at the LOE level and less at the capex level right now.
Neal Dingmann: Very helpful. Thanks again for squeezing me in.
David Pursell: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions in queue. I will now turn the call back to John Christmann. Sir, please go ahead.
John Christmann: Thank you. I'd like to leave you with the following parting thoughts. Delivery was very good in the first quarter, and we have reiterated our full year guidance. Commodity prices continue to be constructive, and we have clear visibility into at least $1 billion in free cash flow this year. We are seeing the benefits of our diversified portfolio as increasing volumes in the Permian over the next two quarters will more than offset the seasonal planned maintenance downtime in the North Sea. Activity will also be picking up in Egypt as we move into the back half of the year. We have successfully transitioned operatorship on Block 58 to our partner, Total, with two rigs conducting very active appraisal and exploration programs for 2021. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress throughout the year. That concludes our call today.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-25 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Apache Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, Gary, Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Gary Clark: Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President John Christmann. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will then provide further color on our results in 2021 outlook. Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations and Dave Pursell Executive Vice President of Development, will also be available on the call to answer questions. Our prepared remarks will be just over 15 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release. I hope you've had the opportunity to review our fourth quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. And finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations; however, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today. I will recap Apaches 2020 accomplishments, discuss our fourth quarter results, and provide commentary on our outlook for 2021. First, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the severe weather and devastating power outages experienced here in Texas last week. Nearly all of our Texas-based employees were directly affected. Our field staff worked tirelessly to maintain safe operations, and like millions of Texans, our employees across the state experienced notable challenges, including a lack of power heat, water and many of the modern conveniences we all rely on. While it appears that numerous factors played into the situation, one thing is certain, this event has underscored the need for resilient and reliable energy infrastructure and supply. 2020, brought many unexpected challenges, which required immediate and aggressive actions. Shortly after we issued our initial guidance for the year, a confluence of events signaled clear trouble for near-term oil prices. The Russians and Saudi's in a battle for market share were flooding the market with supply. At the same time, the spread of COVID-19 was emerging as a significant threat to global demand. In response, on March 12, we announced several important steps designed to protect cash flow in the event of a prolonged adverse oil price environment. We reduced our capital budget by 37% from the budget we had laid out just 2 weeks earlier. We cut our dividend by 90%. We initiated a shutdown of all drilling and completions activity in the US and a reduction of rig activity in both Egypt and the North Sea, and with the significant reduction and planned capital activity, we decided to double our target for combined G&A and LOE cost savings from $150 million to over $300 million. While these actions seemed extreme to me, it turned out to be necessary and timely. Throughout 2020, relative to our original plan, we lost over $1.3 billion of oil and gas price-related revenue and more than $300 million of cash flow to working capital. Despite this, Apache finished the year with no increase in net debt when excluding Altus Midstream. We were even in a position to take advantage of volatility in the debt markets to buy back some bonds at a significant discount in lender issue, $1.25 billion, of new bonds to restructure the debt portfolio and protect near-term liquidity. In addition to these actions, our response to the pandemic was equally swift and effective. We protected employees and minimized operational disruptions by quickly implementing a work-from-home program for office staff and changes in the field operating protocols. To date, there have been no known cases of a COVID-19 transmission from one Apache employee or contractor to another. I'm also especially proud of the assistance we provided to the pandemic response in each of the communities where we operate. Finally, as we look back on 2020, one of the key highlights was our exploration program in Suriname, where we commenced activity under our joint venture with Total. We have now made four significant oil discoveries in our first four exploration tests and recently began the appraisal drilling program. Turning to the fourth quarter results, we ended 2020 on a strong note, beating our fourth quarter guidance for adjusted production, upstream capital expenditures and LOE. Oil production in the quarter was slightly ahead of expectations while gas and NGL production was notably strong as we returned all previously curtailed Alpine High volumes to production around the end of October. In the Permian Basin, we resumed completions activity in response to significantly lower service costs and improving oil prices. In Egypt, we continue to leverage our large acreage position and modern seismic program to further enhance our long-term exploration and development inventory. A recent example of this is the Tiam North discovery, which encountered 88 feet of high-quality oil pay. We are waiting on pipeline connections to further assess the reservoir extent and potential for additional development locations. In the North Sea, we made an important oil discovery in the tertiary play with our Loscan well, an offset to Aker BP's discovery on the Norwegian side of the border. In combination with two previously undeveloped Apache discoveries in the tertiary, Loscan is part of a longer-term development opportunity that could contribute meaningful incremental volumes while leveraging existing infrastructure. Looking ahead in 2021, last night, we announced an upstream capital program of $1.1 billion consisting of approximately $900 million for development activities and $200 million for exploration, predominantly in Suriname. This program is expected to deliver substantial free cash flow under our assumed price deck of $45 WTI oil and $3 Henry Hub natural gas. In 2020, we directed a higher percentage of our development capital to international projects to generate better returns in a lower price environment. With the improvement in oil prices, we are returning to a very modest level of activity in the US during 2021. In the Permian, we are currently running one rig and plan to add a second rig at mid-year. This measured approach will advance our objective of mitigating Permian oil production declines. We will likely need to add a third rig at some point to fully arrest the decline. At Alpine High, we have completed two lean gas ducts. They are performing very well, and we are planning five similar completions this spring. While there are no specific Alpine High drilling plans in 2021, we will continue to monitor commodity prices and remain flexible with this asset. Following several years without operating activity in East Texas, we recently added a rig in the Austin Chalk play. This rig will drill a few wells that are necessary to hold our core acreage position and preserve optionality. We believe that Austin Chalk, which is well situated near existing infrastructure, will likely merit future capital consideration. In Egypt, we plan to continue running five rigs this year. Our goal is to stabilize production and ultimately return Egypt to growth, both of which will require the addition of more rigs. We can quickly flex spending in Egypt as conditions warrant and we will monitor oil prices and cash flow for the appropriate time to do so. In the North Sea, the capital program remains relatively unchanged this year with one floating rig and one platform crew. While production from the North Sea is lumpy on a quarterly basis, we believe we can generally sustain output in the 55,000 to 60,000 BOE a day range for the next several years at this level of activity. Lastly, in Suriname, we began the transfer of Block 58 operatorship to Total at the beginning of the year. They are an excellent operator and we look forward to this year's exploration and appraisal programs. On the exploration side, our fourth well, Keskesi, is continuing to explore deeper objectives in the Neocomian. As previously announced, we have selected the location for our fifth exploration well, Bonboni, which will be in the northern portion of the block. Total spud the first appraisal well in Block 58 earlier this month, which will be appraising aspects of both the Kwaskwasi and Sapakara discoveries. I would like to close by discussing Apache's oil production trajectory and provide some perspective on maintenance capital levels. As previously noted, we chose to significantly reduce capital spending in 2020 and plan to maintain a conservative investment approach in 2021. One of the outcomes of this choice is our global adjusted oil volumes decreased by 17% from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the fourth quarter of 2020. This year, we are projecting a much more moderate decline of around 1% to fourth quarter 2021. This implies the $900 million of capital investment we have earmarked for production and development activities is just a bit shy of the spend required to sustain global oil production in fourth quarter 2020 levels. As we look to 2022 and beyond, our goal is to establish a development capital investment budget that will add a minimum sustained production volumes for the long term. While we have experienced a very welcome Oil and Gas rebound over the last three months, our strategic approach remains centered around capital discipline and flexibility. As such, we are continuing to prioritize the retention of free cash flow to reduce debt. A focus on long-term returns over short term growth, aggressive cost structure management, the advancement of our exploration and appraisal activities in Suriname, and continuous improvement in our ESG practices and metrics. In 2020, we increased the weighting of ESG goals in our short-term compensation calculation to 20% and refined our focus areas to air, water, communities, and people. During the year, we emphasized robust employee safety programs related to COVID-19, assisting our communities impacted by the pandemic and advancing programs that foster a more inclusive workplace. We also made good progress on the environmental front with enhanced greenhouse gas data collection and expanded disclosures, particularly with regard to TCFD. We plan to continue to build on these efforts in 2021 with ESG goals that tie directly to compensation and includes specific emissions and water usage targets and enhance our employees' experience. These include delivering less than 1% flaring intensity in the US, achieving fresh water consumption less than 20% of total water consumed, and further progressing our diversity and inclusion programs. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on our Q results in 2021 outlook.
Steve Riney: Thank you, John. I'd like to provide a bit more color around Apache's fourth-quarter results, debt management efforts in 2020, and our outlook for 2021. As noted in our news release issued yesterday under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported a fourth-quarter 2020 consolidated net income of $10 million. On a fully diluted basis, we incurred a loss of $16 million or $0.04 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings. Excluding these items, the adjusted loss was $20 million or $0.05 per share. Company-wide adjusted production for the quarter was 365,000 BOEs per day, a 7% decrease from the third quarter. This was driven by declines in the Permian Basin and Egypt, where we felt the impacts of reduced activity levels after the first-quarter cut in capital spending. These declines were partially offset by increased North Sea production primarily associated with the timing of work-over activity. These operating expenses of $269 million for the quarter were below guidance but did rise a bit from the third quarter. G&A expense of $76 million was at the low end of our guidance range. This was also an increase from the third quarter but mostly due to mark-to-market accounting treatment of certain stock compensation programs. Entering 2020, one of our key financial goals for the year was to retain free cash flow to reduce debt. While the collapse in oil prices made this significantly more challenging, the decisive actions we took to reduce our capital program cut operating and overhead costs, decreased our dividend, and numerous smaller actions enabled Apache to avoid further leveraging its balance sheet. We also took some important steps to rearrange the bond maturity profile and to create a cleaner runway for the next few years. Through a combination of discounted open market repurchases, tender offers, and call options, we reduced shorter-term bond maturities by $600 million with only minor changes to our average maturity profile and coupon rate. We now have only $336 million of bonds maturing before November 2025. We still intend to reduce debt levels through free cash flow retention, and if oil and gas prices sustain anywhere near current levels, we will make substantial progress in 2021. Further to the 2021 outlook, as John stated, we are planning an upstream capital budget of approximately $1.1 billion with the primary goals of advancing our exploration and appraisal activities in Suriname and stabilizing global oil production around fourth quarter 2020 levels. At this point, it looks like our planned capital program will fall just a bit short of stabilizing oil production. But we continue to look for ways to get more out of those investments. More specifically, to our production profile for 2021, we expect US Oil output to decline in the first quarter. This is primarily attributable to 9 days of extensive Permian Basin shut-ins during the recent freeze event as well as the timing of Permian DUC completions during the quarter. Consequently, we expect a significant rebound in US Oil volumes during the second and third quarters before backing off a bit in the fourth quarter to a rate similar to fourth quarter of 2020. Internationally, we anticipate continued declines for the year compared to fourth quarter 2020 levels as upstream capital investment remains below maintenance levels and we will incur more downtime in the North Sea for scheduled maintenance turnarounds. In 2021, we are projecting LOE to rise approximately 7% year-over-year, which primarily reflects the impact of some cost deferrals from 2020. This includes items such as increased work-over spending and platform maintenance in the North Sea. We also expect to see some higher foreign currency exchange impacts associated with the weakening US dollar. G&A will also rise a bit this year to a run rate of around $75 million per quarter. In closing, we are cautiously optimistic for a year of improved oil and gas prices. Even if we fall a bit from the current strip with a very conservative approach to capital budgeting, we should generate significant free cash flow for debt reduction. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Doug Leggate: Thank you, guys. Appreciate all the color this morning. I got one set of questions on Suriname and one on work-overs, if I may. So on Suriname. John, there's been a little bit of incremental information, partly coming from your partner, including as you pointed out in your release, the likelihood of an FID this year, [indiscernible] by 2025 and then you yourselves spoke about am appraisal program that appears to be topping both KwasKwasi and Sapakara. So, I wonder if you could just walk us through what's going on in the appraisal and what the scale might be of our first development in your mind.
John Christmann: Doug, thanks for the question. The first thing I'll say is, I really don't want to add a lot of color to our partners' commentary, a long timeline. I mean we're aligned with them. What I would say is given that when we made the press release after the Sapakara discovery, we said that it merited consideration for fast track and had those key ingredients. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that the very first appraisal well is doing exactly that. We've always talked about the first four wells and I'll go back and talk about Maka, Sapakara, KwasKwasi, and now Keskesi. It is really four different deep-water turbidite channels systems. They are placed where potentially you could do some overlap and so forth as you start to think about development. So the nice thing about where that first well is placed, Sapakara West. Number 2, is it will be appraising both aspects of Sapakara and we get to see some KwasKwasi? So, it shouldn't come as a surprise and we're obviously anxious to get the results. When we think about the appraisal program, it's just the next step following exploration. In terms of scale, those are the things we wanted to term through the appraisal program. So I don't want to get into discussions on that at this point, but we're going to be looking to determine things like flow rates, connectivity, those types of things, boundaries, things we might see as you work through this. So we're anxious to get on with it and quite frankly excited with how quickly Total has grabbed the hold and is running with it.
Doug Leggate: So, I can't press you on scale, John?
John Christmann: You know, we will take it one phase at a time, but we're in appraisal mode.
Doug Leggate: Okay. I'll let someone else talk about Keskesi but I think when I ask about the maintenance capital, just the trend that you find, it seems kind of remarkable to us that you're managing to hold the decline as shallow that you are, presumably some of that capital is translating into work-over costs in places like the North Sea. So, I just wonder if you could kind of walk us through how you think about the dynamics of work-overs versus capital. I'm really what I'm trying to drive to is what do you think that sustaining breakeven oil prices for that decline that you seem to be able to hold in 2021.
John Christmann: Yes, I mean the thing I would say is, I'm really proud of what our asset teams and our operation staff have been able to accomplish. I mean in a really tough environment with COVID-19 and a lot more protocols added, I cannot say enough good things about our organization and all the hard work that has taken place and you see that, you saw in our cost structure reductions, you see it in these numbers. Not only did we reduce all the drilling rigs in the US, we dramatically cut the work-over rigs in the US and then the other areas as well. And it just goes to show you what the focus and the effort we're putting on it. This year, we did pick up a rig in the Permian. It's the one that made a lot of sense to pick up. We plan to add another rig mid-year and we're going to be just short as I said in the commentary. We probably need to add another one but we don't plan to do that right now to be able to kind of hold our oil production. We're just short of the activity levels in Egypt to kind of hold it, and North Sea is going to be lumpy and we're kind of in that range now, where we think we can manage it between 55 and 60; it's just going to be a lumpy profile with the turnarounds and the types of projects we're bringing on through subsea tie-backs in the Beryl area. But, really, kind of hats off to the operational staff on the asset teams because we're really managing things on cash flow and managing the cost structure really hard, and it's amazing what that's done as a result to the oil curves
Doug Leggate: I'll take the details offline John, but I appreciate the answers. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Bob Brackett: Good morning. Unsurprisingly, I'll follow up a bit on Suriname. If I think about the $200 million exploration budget that seems to have three buckets, a small amount going to Austin Chalk, some going to Suriname exploration, and then the remainder going to appraisal in Suriname where you're paying 12.5 cents on the dollar effectively because of the JV. Can you break those out any more for us, or should we just kind of think of it as one big lump?
John Christmann: Well, Bob, what I would say is, number one, the Chalk money was not appraisal, right. It's development capital. It's an area where we've got leases that are expiring. We had some wells, we had to make a decision there to either drill those wells or let the acreage go. It's not exploration capital. So, we feel good about we've been participating an offset well, so the first thing I would say there. Then, when we look at Suriname, you're right, there are two buckets, but it really will hinge on the types of wells that we're drilling. The exploration wells will be 50/50. And at this phase of our joint venture, the appraisal wells will be 12.5% and so we really didn't break that bucket out. Clearly, the first appraisal well, we're paying 12.5%, and clearly, we're paying 50% of Keskesi. But that dollar amount doesn't change much for where it has been last year when we were running a rig at 50/50 the whole time,
Bob Brackett: Okay, interesting. A quick follow-up would be, what's the timeline for Staatsolie deciding whether to back in for 20% and any thought on where their heads are?
John Christmann: I mean, they actually have that election at the time you FID a project. So we've got some time there. I think they would like to participate. That is what we've always planned on from the get go. But we would obviously be in a position to take additional interest if you get there. But they would come in on a point-forward basis at FID.
Bob Brackett: Okay, that's clear. I'll pause here and maybe hop in the queue later. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeanine Wai at Barclays. Your line is now open.
Jeanine Wai: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions.
John Christmann: Good morning, Jeanine.
Jeanine Wai: Good morning. Our first question is on the 2021 CapEx budget and your anchored at the very conservative 45 and 3. And so, what's your appetite for incremental activity if the strip ends up playing out. We know you said you would be very conservative and you're going to watch things and be very measured. But you said that you ultimately need a third rig in the Permian to arrest decline, you have some really good opportunities in Egypt and you maybe need a little more activity there to mitigate decline as well. So I guess what is your appetite on all of that and where are you most likely to add that incremental activity if it could be done this year?
John Christmann: Yes, Jeanine. Right now, our appetite is generating free cash flow that we can set aside for debt repayment. And we're just pointing out that to really stabilize Permian, we do need to add another rig. There may be an opportunity in Egypt, but right now, like I said, we're going to be very disciplined on the capital and we would just be very measured, and right now the appetite is to generate free cash flow for debt repayment.
Jeanine Wai: Okay. We like free cash flow and debt repayment; that's good. And then my second question, maybe just following up on Bob's question just now. I might have missed part of it. In that $200 million in exploration CapEx that's primarily Suriname. Is there anything in there for offshore Dominican Republic? I think you are finalizing something on that a few months ago.
John Christmann: Yes, there is a small bit there, Jeanine. I mean where we're starting to go through the work and scoping out our 3D seismic shoot. So there is a little bit of money in there, but it is not a lot that it would be captured.
Jeanine Wai: Great, thank you.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Bob Brackett: Well, I had hopped out of the queue and I guess you put me back in. I was going to let other people get a chance.
John Christmann: Bob, I don't know what happened because there is a list here. So I would say the operator puts you back in. But if you want to ask one since we've done it. I would say, I ask it. But we weren't trying to step over anybody else. But there is a list here.
Bob Brackett: So, I guess I'll stay on that Suriname theme, which is talking about getting to FID. Is there a drill stem test planned for the year and I'm just kind of surprised by the speed at which you can go from no appraisal to FID in less than 12 months? Is there something you can do to give us comfort on that timeline?
John Christmann: Yes, I would just say, our partner is pretty confident in the rock, I mean I'll just leave it at that. I mean we've got four exploration wells now, we've been taking our time with those, collecting a lot of data, we've gone sidewall cores, we've done a lot of PBT analysis. They're not well more than we intend to use. But we've been gathering a lot of data as we've gone along, and we've been doing a lot of lab work subsequent. So, I'll just leave it at that. I mean clearly, we will be doing flow tests with the appraisal program as the other piece, Bob. But I'll leave it there. I don't want to by no means want to do anything but state we're going to the next phase. And I don't want to try to add any commentary to the timeline that our partners talked about. But we are moving on the appraisal wells that we think could be fast-tracked.
Bob Brackett: Great, thanks for that.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Harry Halbach with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Harry Halbach: Good morning. I was looking at Total's release and they said around nine wells are expected this year. Can you sort of rough estimates on the timing of those and when we can expect results and kind of just be - for exploration and appraisal wells going forward?
John Christmann: I mean, all we really say here is, there's two rigs. I would say that nine wells is their whole portfolio. But we've got two rig programs here that I would say. We drilled three plus wells with one rig line last year on the exploration front. Some of the appraisal wells could go quicker because you've now got penetrations in the basin. But some of these might take longer because of flow test and things. So I would just say we haven't given that color. We've just said, kind of, think of it as an exploration rig line program and an appraisal program, and we're going to move on them concurrently.
Harry Halbach: Great, thanks. Appreciate that. And then looking at the US, what does that maintenance mode, sort of, program looks like including Alpine High, and how is the returns to Alpine High stacking up to the Austin Chalk or the other Permian steps just with the moving propane and butane prices lately.
Dave Pursell: Yes, Harry, this is Dave Pursell. So, when we think about maintenance in the Permian, we're thinking about it on the oil side. And so when we talk about three rigs, we're thinking about what it takes to keep oil production flat. And we're going to run that map at Alpine. I think when you look at the forward curve on gas and NGLs, even though we have preliminarily positive results from the two DUCs that are flowing back now, given where the oil prices are, it's unlikely in a limited capital budget that those compete within the Apache budget, but if there're economic, we're open to think about partnering with someone to help us move Alpine forward.
Harry Halbach: Thanks. Appreciate you all taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Scialla with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my call.
John Christmann: Good morning, Mike,
Unidentified Analyst: This is actually Guillermo stepping in for Mike. I was wondering if you could provide additional color on the US. You mentioned you adding a second rig. But just to confirm, to hit your guidance number. Will you need that third rig or your comments on adding that third rig are showing some upside potential to your guidance?
John Christmann: No, I mean we do not have it planned. It's not in the plan, and obviously if it is not in the plan, it wouldn't be in our guidance. So we were just making the reference point that we're just shy on the oil side and we would likely need one more rig in the Permian, which right now we do not plan to add, I want to be really clear there. It is not in our guidance.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you for the clarification. And going forward, you mentioned maintenance mode, is it fair to assume a slight growth in the US to upset international volumes or should it be maintenance all across the board?
Dave Pursell: Yes, I think when we talk about this, we're talking about maintenance across the board.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you. And the last one for me. I suppose Austin Chuck, a competitor of yours, suggested a well performance that could compete with the Permian. You have similar expectations for those wells?
Dave Pursell: Yes, this is Dave again, Guillermo. We've been patient as we've watched this play develop. We have a big acreage positions legacy, we participate in some non-op wells, and we have high expectations, which is why we're drilling these. But again, John said it, it allows us to preserve the optionality of this, again to bring in some additional capital if we choose to.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you very much. That's it for me and have a great day.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson with Stephens. Your line is now open.
Gail Nicholson: Good morning. Steve, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that there is some cost deferrals on the LOE side in '20 that are hitting in '21. Could you quantify that amount and then what is the more normalized LOE rate look like post '21?
Steve Riney: Sorry Gail, I don't have a quantification of the amount that was deferred from 2020, nor how much of that is actually showing up in 2021; maybe just suggest that you can follow up with Gary after the call, maybe we can get an estimate of that. But I don't think it is a material amount. But it's certainly contributing to the 7% rise in LOE from one year to the next. Sorry, what was the second part of the question?
Gail Nicholson: I just wanted to know if we [indiscernible] amount, what would the normal LOE run rate look like?
Steve Riney: Yes. Well, I think actually the 2021 amount is probably the more normal amount, because what we've done is, we've just deferred some stuff out of 2020 into 2021. We're not necessarily doubling up a lot of stuff. There could be a little bit in there. So you're probably in the low single digits in terms of the band of error there in terms of doubling up some expense into 2021. I don't think it's got a material effect.
Gail Nicholson: Okay, great. And then, in the supplement, you guys talked about the Egyptian decline rate is expected to moderate in 2021. Can you talk about where it is today and where you think it will be by year-end and what is driving that moderation?
Dave Pursell: This is Dave again. I think when you look at, particularly in the Permian, you look at the way unconventionals behave. I'm sorry I misunderstood the question. Yes, in Egypt, it's a combination of activity and where we're focused. We have a pretty significant work-over program there that is also really bringing in behind pipe resource. So as production declines, you tend to have an easier time holding it stable. So that's the way the math works there in Egypt.
Gail Nicholson: All right. Thank you.
John Christmann: Thank you, Gail.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Scott Hanold: Thanks. If I could move back to maybe discussing Alpine High, I mean do you all think there some latent value that's associated with the infrastructure or even maybe the gas, the well in the gas production opportunity here is, and if that's the case, is there opportunities for you guys to do something to get some of that value recognized and specifically too on the infrastructure side with what you all have there as well as your joint venture agreements?
John Christmann: No, Scott. There is no doubt. I mean you've got resource there, we've gone in and done a couple of DUCs, which we said there are the first two we've done. They're performing very nicely. I think we've got five more DUCs. It will finish the DUC program with later this spring. So there is opportunity there to potentially bring in some capital. I mean what we've got right now with where our capital budget is, it's pretty tight. So we don't plan to add any, but there is opportunities to potentially look at some things out there.
Scott Hanold: Okay. Is that an initiative free all or is that just something that could happen?
John Christmann: I mean, I'd just say that there is a lot of things we always work on that you don't spell out. But I'll just leave it at that. It's something that we might be working on or would be thinking about, but there's nothing we've got set up or planned in the activity set.
Scott Hanold: No problems. Thanks for that. And then, my next question is, if you all could you remind me in Egypt with the PSC and higher oil prices, at what point do you start getting to sort of cap on the value [indiscernible] ways away from there. Obviously, I think the strip has moved up pretty nicely, and there is obviously some conversation out there whether we get into the next oil super cycle, I just kind of want to remind me the sensitivity to higher oil prices with that PSC.
John Christmann: No, I mean the returns there are good. It's just that things shift as you move higher, right. And you get to a point in there where inventory in the US and the Permian actually spends over and be more attractive. So we're not in that range. I mean we're at a point today, if you go back and look last year, we put out some priority sheets that kind of showed investment levels with some price decks and kind of at 50 was where we considered Permian. I mean there's nothing that's changed off that to those priorities that we put out there.
Scott Hanold: Understood. Thank you.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Dave Pursell: Sorry, before we go to the next, if I could just add a bit to that, I'd say that in the $50 to $60 Brent range we've still got plenty of running room where price continues to add meaningful amount of value to the Egypt opportunities. So we're not near any type of ceiling on value opportunities in Egypt, nowhere near that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Brian Singer: Thank you and good morning.
John Christmann: Morning, Brian.
Brian Singer: Want to follow-up on a couple of the topics, first maybe starting with Suriname and the exploration appraisal budget that's largely the large component of $200 million, in a continued success scenario and reflective of the less demanding capital contracts as part of the joint venture, how do you see Suriname CapEx evolving in years to come and how do the optionality of the call on Suriname capital impact your willingness to flex other assets like Egypt, Alpine High, and Permian?
John Christmann: Yes, Brian, I mean the nice thing is as you start shifting more dollars into appraisal and development with the carriers really kicking in. So those numbers don't go up, so it doesn't hinder. I mean that's part of why we structured that deal in the first place. It's really the exploration rigs that drive because of the 50-50. Obviously as you shift into development and assume a new FID something, then your dollars will go up but I mean it's not going to be something we can manage. It's not something that's going to take away capital from other areas.
Brian Singer: Got it, thanks. And then, my follow up is trying to piece together some of the comments from your opening remarks as well as other questions as it relates to the CapEx flexibility, you were very nimble in flexing CapEx to the downside in 2020. There seems to be a consideration to be nimble on the upside, and I was wondering if you could quantify if you were to stabilize production in the Permian with a third rig, stabilize production in Egypt and pricing in NGLs and natural gas warranted some greater activity in Alpine High, what the combined incremental capital would represent to make that happen?
John Christmann: Yes. I mean, I'd say today, Brian, we're not thinking about trying to be nimble there and I add, right, I mean we pulled our plan. Actually, the rig we picked up in Permian, we've been paying standby rates on. So it made a lot of sense for us to pick that rig up. And when we reduced last year, we drastically reduced. In fact, like I said, we were paying some standby rate. So we're not really motivated right now to try to be nimble and pick up incremental capital, we're just pointing out kind of where those things would be. But, I mean, right now, I think Steve especially wants to see some dollars come in that we can earmark for debt repayment.
Brian Singer: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.
Leo Mariani: I just wanted to follow up here a bit on Suriname. Just wanted to dive a little bit into the Neocomian zone here. What can you kind of tell us about that particular zone? Is that pricing and the other 3 discoveries, and then in general, is it present or maybe just other areas of the basin and has anyone else had any penetrations potentially elsewhere in the basin in this particular zone?
John Christmann: Yes, great question. I mean, you know, when we talk about Block 58 in the first place, we laid out more than a handful of different play types and quite frankly our first three play types are all upper Cretaceous. Campanian. Santonian are the first two and then the third one is actually [indiscernible] which is also upper Cretaceous. We attempted to get down to the Maka [ph], but we were unable to do to pressure. With the Neocomian, it is actually a lower Cretaceous target. You know, when I talk about the upper Cretaceous, Campanian and Santonian, they're really deep-water channel and turbidite [ph]. But the Neocomian is lower Cretaceous and it's more shallow-water carbonate reef buildups and so in others. I will tell you that we're not through the first two targets. We've got to Neocomian targets to test in Keskesi. What we have to do is swap out the BOPs. And so we're in the process of doing that. We'll be back to drilling, but these are carbonate reefs. They're pretty visible on the seismic, but this will be the first test for us, and this was an optimal place to go on down through the source rock to the Neocomian, and we're anxious to see. But it is exploration, they're visible. If it were to work and bear the right fluids, then it sets up a whole string of these that are down there. So it's a play concept test. And this just was the logical best place to do the first test for the Neocomian.
Leo Mariani: So just to confirm, you guys certainly believe this is present across your block and potentially in other areas in Suriname. And is this kind of the first test that you're aware of in the basin?
John Christmann: No. I mean, I'd say when we've got multiple domains across the block. I mean, what you've got to understand is with the geology here, there are play types that are present in as you start thinking about other play types in those portion of the block that are present in some areas but not everywhere. So it gets back down to what the settings where like when it was laid down and I said this was lower Cretaceous, it's more shallow water carbonate reef buildups. And so there's probably a trend of those. There is a trend that moves across our block. But we're focused mainly on our block. And this is the first one, obviously it is exploration. So obviously the chance of success you put in there is likely not going to work. But if it does work, it does set up some more targets for us. But it is an exploration well for a reason. It is a play concept, but if it happens to work, we've got more of these on the block that would be additive and potentially could become part of whatever you did in terms of an FID somewhere down the road.
Leo Mariani: Thanks, very helpful color for sure. So I'm going to shift over to Egypt here. You guys obviously made a discovery at [indiscernible] sounds like you're waiting on pipe there. Just wanted to get a sense of when you guys might think you'd be able to get back out there, just high-level timeframe. Is it something that we could talk about just in a matter of months, we can go out there and get a better look at the appraisal, or is this something that could be a longer term that might get pushed into the next year?
John Christmann: No, we're pretty quick. The nice thing about Western Desert is we've got good infrastructure. I think the most important thing with [ph] is it proves concept with the new seismic because it's something that we would not have seen with seismic [ph], and while it's a very nice discovery, we need to do some flow testing and things to figure out if there is offsets and how many. Most importantly, it's proof of concept and we've got some other key wells that are on the rig schedule that are coming pretty soon. So, it's just further validation of the time we've invested over the last few years with selling together more acreage, shooting the seismic, and really refining some of our interpretation skills on what we're doing there. So it's just a lens into the rock, which you would have seen otherwise, and that's what we're excited about.
Leo Mariani: Okay. Good color. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.
Neal Dingmann: Good morning, John and team and thanks for squeezing me in and maybe before Bob's third one. So a quick question for you, look at slide 12 just on the operating cash margins. John, you obviously continue to have great margins on North Sea among the others. I'm just wondering, given the type of margins you continue to see there, why not push that even further?
John Christmann: Well, I mean I think the key there is, we're in pretty good rhythm, if you look at what we did last year, we had two platform crews, they're actually one at Beryl and one at Forties, we started alternating those. We're in a pretty good cadence of projects. With the one rig, we've been doing what we could do in terms of prioritizing. We've got a really nice discovery there with [indiscernible]. Yes, I think we're in a good place with where we are. A really good cadence. And when you look at our other types of opportunities across the portfolio while the margins are really good there, I think we're investing and we're showing good work and now we've got a tertiary project that we're going to work on, not ready to talk about yet. But I think we're in a good cadence in the North Sea.
Neal Dingmann: Okay. And then just the last. Can you talk just on Egypt with that being, still is it free cash flow independent I assume, John, and we will continue to be.
John Christmann: No, I mean we've got a good solid business there. We've built it over 25 years now. You know, we reduced activity when we had to everywhere. I think there's the opportunity as Steve mentioned, we've got a lot of opportunity in Egypt. I think the new seismic and the new acreage is going to open some things up and there is more to do there. But we're always working on preserving cash flow and those cash margins everywhere. And that's something we've been working on across the entire portfolio.
Neal Dingmann: Perfect, thank you.
John Christmann: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy. Your line is now open.
David Heikkinen: Good morning. And first and foremost - yours fared well through the freeze and thaw; it sounds like you did so, that sounds good.
John Christmann: Thank you, Dave.
David Heikkinen: Also just a couple of quick hits, kind of good luck with the Neocomian. It sounds like, I could characterize it as a string of pearls-type prospect or trend that you hit this one and then you'll have other high spots that are just going to follow along the same depth position.
John Christmann: Yes, I mean I would say it's how you could think about it, right. I mean, definitely it's all carbonate reefs working a shallow water environment.
David Heikkinen: That's what you're seeing. So you're seeing that type of string of pearls is what I was getting at.
John Christmann: Yes, there are multiple targets that this would set up, but it's deep, and there's risk, right. But we'll see what happens?
David Heikkinen: And then just, Dave, you kind of hit on some of the base decline tempering and you had it in the slides, I don't think I heard an answer as far as you got the sustainably low level of CapEx and you have a base [ph] declined tempering in 2021. Can you put any numbers to that tempering as you roll into 2022, your sustaining CapEx, sounds like it might go down and your operating expenses don't sound like they would go up some? So I'm trying to think of how things temper through the year.
Dave Pursell: Yes. Let's talk about the Permian for a minute. We've given some numbers on base decline in the past, I don't have those at the tip of my fingers, but you know how unconventionals work. As you anniversary in the big first year production decline, you start to moderate the declines on the unconventional and then we have an obviously big legacy position. So think about third or more of our Permian production is a very shallow decline that was Central Basin Platform-type well. So we have an advantaged position. We never got into that super-size growth mode in the Permian. So the first-year declines that we anniversaried in weren't as big as others. So when we look at the capital required for sustaining production, it's kind of in that 3 rig level and you'll see the similar analysis if we look at Egypt as well. It's a bit more conventional declines but you'll see as overall production declines moderate it becomes easier to hold production at those levels. So don't have numbers in front of me, but that's directionally why the maintenance capital is probably lower today than what we've talked about in the past.
David Heikkinen: And then, just an absolute debt-level target. Do you have one for this year post the use of cash?
Steve Riney: Not necessarily a specific debt level target. My target is as low as possible. So longer term, we've said this before, we're trying to get back to something below 2, approaching 1.5 times debt to EBITDA. We were getting close in 2019 and then 2020 happened. It looks like this year at $55 WTI, we're going to be approaching 2 again. At the current strip, we'd actually be below 2. And that's what the current level of debt. And we should be able to generate a significant amount of free cash flow. At anything $55 or above, there's going to be a huge amount of free cash flow. We're planning on being free cash flow positive for a few 100 million at $45. So 2020-ish [ph] collapse in oil price, we're going to generate quite a bit of free cash flow this year. So I think we're going to get debt to EBITDA back in the right direction by the end of this year to be quite a bit stronger by the time we enter 2022.
David Heikkinen: Thank you, guys. That's very helpful.
Operator: Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time, I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO, John Christmann for closing remarks.
John Christmann: Yes, thank you. I really want to close the following key points. Despite the recent run in oil prices, our priorities have not changed. We remain focused on funding projects that provide the best returns over the longer term. Maintaining a balanced portfolio, generating free cash flow to pay down debt, and continuing to move our program forward. We are taking a very measured approach with our 2021 capital program and you've seen that through the Q&A today. We ended 2020 with zero rigs in the Permian, and the combination of higher WTI prices and lower service costs, make this an appropriate time to restart a very modest drilling program. Our goal is not to pursue growth but to sustain oil production beyond 2021. Our program in Suriname is progressing well. The transition to total as operator has gone smoothly, and we are aligned with our partner on both the appraisal and exploration programs, and most importantly the objective of achieving first oil as quickly and as safely as possible. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress throughout the year. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-05 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Apache Corporation Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Announcement Webcast Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you and please go ahead, sir.
Gary Clark: Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation’s third quarter financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann; Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO will then summarize our third quarter financial performance; Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President Development will also be available on the call to answer questions. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 10 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday’s press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our third quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today’s call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally, I’d like to remind everyone that today’s discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call I will review our third quarter performance, provide some preliminary color on our 2021 plan and update our progress in Suriname.  While commodity prices improved and were less volatile during the third quarter, macro headwinds continue to persist. Apache's strategic approach to creating shareholder value, however, remains unchanged. We are prioritizing long-term returns over growth, generating free cash flow, strengthening our balance sheet through debt reduction and advancing a large-scale opportunity in Suriname. We are allocating capital to the best return opportunities across our diversified portfolio, aggressively managing our cost structure and continue progressing important safety and emissions reduction initiatives. Apache believes that energy underpins global progress, and we want to be a part of that conversation and solution as society works to meet growing global demand for reliable, affordable and cleaner energy. As we work to help meet global energy needs, we are focused on developing innovative and more sustainable ways to operate. Our environmental, social and governance framework continues to evolve. And early next year, we will communicate more on the enhancements we are making in these areas. We want to be a partner to the communities where we live and work and deliver shared value for all of our stakeholders. Turning now to the third quarter. Our upstream capital investment, lease operating expenditures and G&A for the quarter were all below guidance. The organizational redesign we initiated a year ago is delivering combined cost savings in excess of our previous estimate of $300 million on an annualized basis. In terms of production, we exceeded our guidance in the U.S. and delivered in-line volumes internationally. U.S. oil volumes declined 11,000 barrels per day or 12% from the second quarter. This was the result of several factors. The most notable of which was our conscious decision to suspend Permian Basin drilling and completion activity back in April. Additionally, we implemented a series of intermittent shut-ins in the Southern Midland Basin to assess optimal well spacing. And lastly, we chose to leave approximately 4,000 barrels per day of oil shut-in during the quarter, primarily from the Central Basin platform, most of which we do not anticipate returning to production until prices warrant. By early July, most of our shut-in volumes at Alpine High had returned to production, which drove the increase in gas and NGL volumes compared to the second quarter. We are now seeing very compelling service costs in the Permian Basin. And as a result, have retained 2 frac crews to begin completing our backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells. We are mindful of price volatility and will take a flexible approach to the flow-back timing of these wells. Regardless, there will be no impact from this program on our fourth quarter Permian production and minimal impact on our full year 2020 capital guidance, which we have reduced to $1 billion. Looking ahead to 2021, we anticipate an upstream capital budget of $1 billion or less, which is based on a WTI oil price of approximately $40 per barrel and a Henry Hub natural gas price of $2.75. In this price environment, our capital allocation priorities will remain unchanged. We envision a stepped-up program in Surinam that will include both exploration and appraisal drilling, a 5 to 6 rig program in Egypt, 1 floating rig and 1 platform crew in the North Sea and 2 frac crews in the Permian Basin. We do not envision a sustained drilling program in the Permian, but will monitor oil prices and service costs for the appropriate time that they serve.  Let me be really clear. If NYMEX futures are materially below $40, we are prepared to reduce capital accordingly as we have demonstrated in the past. As previously noted, we plan to direct nearly all free cash flow in 2021 toward debt reduction. In terms of production trajectory next year, our DUC completion program should stabilize Permian oil volumes at a level consistent with fourth quarter 2020 levels while Egypt and the North Sea will likely see modest declines. Turning now to Suriname. During the third quarter, we completed operations on our third successful exploration test in Block 58, Kwaskwasi which is our best well in the basin thus far. We are currently working with our partner, Total, on an appraisal plan, which will be submitted to Staatsolie before year-end. Following Kwaskwasi, we commenced drilling our fourth exploration well, Keskesi in mid-September. We have also selected our fifth exploration well, Bonboni, which will be situated in the North Central portion of Block 58. Apache is in the process of transitioning operatorship of Block 58 to Total, who will conduct all exploration and appraisal activities subsequent to Keskesi. I want to close by thanking our employees worldwide for maintaining safe operations, delivering on our key business goals and helping to minimize the spread of the coronavirus in our workplace and communities. Our field personnel have done an exceptional job instituting operational protocols that enable business continuity and our office staff successfully adapted to the remote work environment. That said, we look forward to returning Apache employees to the office in the future. And I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney.
Steve Riney : Thank you, John. On today's call, I will review third quarter 2020 results, discuss progress on our balance sheet initiatives and provide a few thoughts on our fourth quarter guidance. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported a third quarter 2020 consolidated net loss of $4 million or $0.02 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which are an unrealized gain on derivatives and an impairment for unproved leasehold. Excluding these and other smaller items, the adjusted loss was $59 million or $0.16 per share. U.S. production increased slightly from the second quarter as the return of curtailed production volumes, most notably at Alpine High, more than offset the declines resulting from no drilling activity and only 1 well completion in the quarter. Internationally, adjusted production was down approximately 6% from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the impacts in Egypt of higher oil prices on cost recovery volumes and natural field declines. This was partially offset by the return of previously curtailed production in the North Sea. Apache's third quarter average realized price on a BOE basis recovered significantly from the prior quarter, up 45% as WTI oil prices averaged around $40 per barrel and Henry Hub natural gas prices trended up to nearly $3 per Mcf by the end of the quarter. G&A expense in the quarter was $52 million, well below our guidance of $80 million. Most of the variance reflects a mark-to-market change in the value of future cash settled stock awards and a reduction in the estimated value of our 2018 and 2019 performance share programs. Excluding these types of impacts, our underlying G&A expense runs around $75 million per quarter. As always, efforts will continue to lower our G&A costs as we identify more ways to run the company more efficiently. Lease operating expenses were also below guidance for the quarter. On a per unit basis, LOE declined nearly 25% from a year ago, mostly as a result of our corporate redesign and cost reduction efforts. I'll turn now to our balance sheet initiatives. In August, favorable market conditions provided an opportunity to refinance a portion of our debt at attractive rates. We issued $1.25 billion of new bonds. And including the debt repurchased in the second quarter, we will use all of proceeds to reduce other long-term debt. Specifically in 3Q we used proceeds to tender for $644 million of existing debt at a slight discount to par. Additionally, this week, we called at par the remaining $183 million of notes scheduled to mature in 2021. Between now and the end of 2023, we have only $337 million of debt maturing, which we plan to retire with free cash flow. Apache's liquidity position remains in very good shape. At September 30, we had just over $3 billion of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility. The vast majority of the consumed portion of the facility is for the letters of credit associated with future North Sea asset retirement obligations. Before wrapping up, I'd like to point out that we issued fourth quarter 2020 guidance yesterday and our financial and operational supplement which can be found on our website. As John noted, we expect our full year 2020 upstream capital investment to be around $1 billion. This implies an uptick in fourth quarter capital to around $200 million, which reflects some incremental capital associated with the DUC completion program that is beginning this month. While we continue to make good progress on our lifting costs, reported LOE is expected to rise a bit in the fourth quarter to around $270 million. This increase simply reflects the quarterly variations caused by timing impacts. In summary, Apache continues to make steady progress on the goals we set for the year. While the operating environment remains challenging from a commodity price and cash flow perspective, we continue to take every possible action to reduce our cost structure, protect the balance sheet and retain asset value for the future. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mr. John Freeman of Raymond James.
John Freeman : Yes. The first question, just on Suriname, when you all mentioned that you're nearing the award of the 2 rigs for 2021, I just want to make sure that I'm thinking about this the right way. That doesn't necessarily imply that you're just going to have the 1 exploration, 1 appraisal rig for next year. That's just -- that's what you're currently in the process of, but there could be additional activity as you progress through '21 in Suriname?
John Christmann : Yes, John, what we've got is we've said there'll be 2 programs, both an exploration and an appraisal program. We're currently on our last well, Keskesi, with the rig that we're operating, the Noble Sam Croft. That will be released once that well is concluded, but we're in the middle of the tender with Total, and they're going to be picking up 2 rigs early next year. And there will be a combination of exploration and appraisal with those 2 rigs.
John Freeman : And then as you go through the rest of '21, I guess, when you decide whether or not you and Total, if you're going to add additional rigs to the plan, is that driven in some ways just by the timing of receiving approval on these appraisal plans on the first three wells?
John Christmann : No, that will just be a decision we make based on which wells you want to pull forward and how you want to play it. So the 2 rigs are going to be a minimum for next year.
John Freeman : Okay. And then just the 1 follow-up on Suriname, maybe just some additional color on what went into choosing the other location on the Bonboni well. Obviously, up to this point, you'll kind of been moving in kind of a West-East direction across the block. Does this now assume we're set up to kind of go from a North to South kind of direction?
John Christmann : John, if you step back, I mean that's kind of been the plan from the get-go and it was always the plan. The first 4 wells, we had lined up to kind of go across just 1 direction. They're on trend with the wells that have been drilled in the blocks, both to our East and West, there's now a rig running in on the other side of this. We just got to step back and realize just the perspective and just how big Block 58 is and even Block 53. It's the equivalent of over 250 Gulf of Mexico blocks. So just we’re working our way, one direction is pretty -- a big move. Obviously, we've said there's a lot of depth. These are all independent separate features that run outward. And so we're anxious to kind of get out, as we've announced Bonboni, it will be the fifth well. It will be drilled early next year. Total will drill that well. And we're anxious to move out more towards the -- kind of the North Central part and start to show just that dimension of this in terms of the block. So it's exciting. We've said there will be a continuation next year on the exploration pace. And obviously, we're anxious to start appraising. So it's going to be fun.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson of Stephens.
Gail Nicholson : I just had a question in regards to Suriname. When you guys look at what you have done upward Block 53, can you just talk about what you learned there in those original 2 wells drilled and how that has helped you influence some of your decision process on the exploration activity?
John Christmann : Well, Gail, if you go back to early 2015, we were drilling our first well Popokai and it was actually drilled ahead of the Liza well in the Stabroek Block. So you go back in time, the main thing that Popokai did for us was it helped us inform us that, one, we wanted to go ahead and pick up Block 58. So that's the first thing. I would say secondly, we actually were able to drill the thing all the way down through the source interval and gain a lot of information with it. The second well, Kolibrie, was further outbound, really drilled some really, really high-quality sands and told us a lot about that. So I think Block 53 is highly prospective. I think the well that's being drilled next door to us will be very informative. I think our Keskesi well will be very informative and also Bonboni.  So we've got 1 well commitment left at in Block 53, but I think it holds a lot of promise for the future. So it's sitting nice. I think with the work we've done since, there's a lot of potential in Block 53.
Gail Nicholson : Great. And then just looking at those incremental cost savings that you guys have achieved with the portfolio optimization, where are you guys thinking that breakeven is today on the assets? 
John Christmann : Yes, I mean if you go back to last quarter, we talked about where our volumes were. We have moved kind of from a 50 to low 30s kind of going forward this year. Next year, it will tick a little higher because our volumes are going to be down. But I think, generally, we're in a pretty good place, and we continue to surprise ourselves by what we're able to drive out of the cost structure. I mean we've driven another $100 million out. Steve, I'll let you hop in and provide a little bit more color.
Steve Riney : Yes, Gail, I'll just add to that, we have -- we continue to make efforts on the cost cutting and cost focus. And the most surprising thing to us this year is the pace at which we're actually able to capture them in the current year. So we're around $400 million now of annualized savings, and we'll get at least $300 million of that and probably more in the current year. And so as John says, as you know, we've got declining production volume as we round the corner into 2021, and that works against the cash flow breakeven, flattening in the U.S. oil, as we talked about. But the -- that can -- will tend to be offset by the annualized benefit of the cost savings going into next year. But the breakeven of $30 per barrel on a cash flow basis is going to go up a bit as we round the corner into '21.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Doug Leggate of Bank of America.
Doug Leggate : John, just maybe a follow up to Gail’s question if I may on Popokai. Give me a minute to ask this. So Popokai as I understand that was a tight hole. But our discussions just solely suggest that the failure mechanism was reservoir quality, and it's kicked off some controversy given that we haven't got any data in the first 3 wells that you drilled. So I wonder if you could put that to rest and talk to us about reservoir quality of the 3 wells? And I'd like to remind you, obviously, that the Maka well, you did say you saw it capable of prolific oil. So any data you can give us to put that to rest on the 3 discoveries? I've got a follow-up, please.
John Christmann : Well, number 1, we have not released a lot of data, the data on Popokai, and it was tight. And I'll tell you the key to that was record the source interval. So there was not an issue with reservoir quality in any of the zones. It had some other factors. But it was -- the key for there was it gave us a lot of the key data and we were able to core the source interval, which helped us with the maturity, which played back into Block 58. So that was the key there. I think that, Doug, from our perspective, the information that we've released with Total has been agreed between the 2 parties on everything we've released, the net pays for what have been the -- both Campanian and Santonian numbers. They're not our estimate, not their estimate, they're agreed. So we feel really good about those numbers. I think in general, the quality is good. But for us to really get into a lot of detail, we've got to get into the appraisal work, and that's -- we're going to be very deliberate with the steps and the information that we put out, but I can assure you that some of the rumblings we heard of [indiscernible] that's not a mistake you'd make or it's not something you'd find with the logging suite and the detailed core analysis and all the work we're doing. So we feel good about the reservoirs, but we really need to follow the appraisal work to be able to start putting out more information. This isn't -- it's a conventional play, and there's a reason you go to those next phases. But there's a lot of zones. I mean we're in a super basin. It's large. We've got a lot of really, really good rock, and we're very pleased with where we are. I mean, it's -- but we're still on our fourth well across 1 dimension, and it's just really early to start talking about things you'd typically do after you've gone into your full appraisal when you can come back with concrete information.
Doug Leggate : No evidence from the logs. I guess, just a clarification point real quick. When you announced Kwaskwasi, you've obviously talked about the cementing problems. Could you lose circulation into the reservoir on that well?
John Christmann : What we said was we got into higher pressure below our target in the lower Santonian. It's not a matter of losing circulation. The trick was, what do we need to do to put the cement plugs in. And so we had to put a lot of fluid in, in the well to -- from the other direction. And so that's why we compromised the ability to actually get the fluids out of the Santonian because we had an open hole that we had to balloon over time. So it was more a function of the drilling operations. It wasn't cementing problems, Doug. It was that we had to set two cement plugs, let me just be real clear on that. There were no cementing problems. We just had to set 2 cement plugs below the Santonian because of the pressure that we had, and we had the open hole above us, which compromised other -- we'd already run logs on it, but it compromised the ability later to get fluids.
Doug Leggate : To be clear, the reason I'm asking the question, it was around about way you're trying to get that reservoir question answered because seems to me if you overpressured the reservoir and lost mud into the reservoir, is a very porous permeable reservoir, that's why I was asking the question. My follow-up real quick is Bonboni, I guess, that’s how you pronounce it. Any source or migration differences in the depositional setup there geologically compared to what your first 3 targets look like or first four targets look like? I'll leave it there.
John Christmann : Doug, Bonboni is exciting. We'll have both the Campanian and the Santonian targets. There's also an opportunity to go a little bit deeper and test some other things. So same setting. These are -- it's a good distance out. And I think it just -- it's going to give us another ability to explore the other dimension of this block, which we're quite excited about. But the primary targets are going to be similar. And you're going to see those targets as we continue in these next several wells. A lot of it is going to be about the campaign and the Santonian. But I do want to remind you, we've got some other targets that at some point we'll get to.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research.
Bob Brackett : Kind of repeating on a similar theme. If we think about Block 53, I note that you've included it back again into some of the materials, you've got a single well remaining to meet your commitment. Are your partners aligned with potentially drilling a well in '21 or 2022?
John Christmann : Yes. Bob, I'll say our partners would love for us to get back in there. And it's not that we ever excluded it, it's just we've been focused on 58. 53 is something we made a well commitment on that we've got to actually drill before the spud before the end of the second quarter of 2022, and it's something we're very excited about. We've got 45% of it. I can promise you 2 of our partners, 1 of them is in the well that's being drilled South of there right now. So yes, they're anxious and we will get to it in due course, and we're anxious, too. But there's a lot of activity that's going to be very informative on the potential in Block 53.
Bob Brackett : Great. A quick follow-up. The water depth for Bonboni, I can probably look off the symmetry, but if you have that handy?
John Christmann : I don't have that off the top of my fingertips here. It's not real crazy. It's going to be deeper. But it's not something crazy. I'm looking down here at Clay. Operationally, he’d know yet. But it's not -- I don't think it's crazy. We can -- Gary can follow up with that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Scott Gruber of Citigroup.
Scott Gruber : In the Permian, how many DUCs do you have? How long can you keep 2 frac crews working without adding any rigs down there?
Dave Pursell : Yes, Scott, this is Dave Pursell. We have about 45 DUCs in the Permian. We'll pick 2 frac crews up here later in the quarter. And those will stay busy through the middle of next year.
Scott Gruber : Got it. And then you also mentioned a flexible approach to flowback timing on those completions. Obviously, post-completion, the well cost is basically [sold]. How do you think about flowback strategy on those? I assume there's more price threshold, you're thinking about, but some color there would be great.
Dave Pursell : Yes. We'll look at a number of factors as we bring the wells back online, some of these -- we have 5, 3 milers that we're bringing back, and we'll keep those facility constrained for a while. But really, we're going to look at the forward curve on price and how the wells are flowing back and just see how we want to -- how aggressive we want to be with the chokes through the end of '21. So we just want to keep some optionality out there given the volatility in the oil price.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Paul Cheng of Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng : John, for the Bonboni, do you have -- what is the depth that you have to drill below the seabed to reach the TD?
John Christmann : Yes. It's actually -- the thing is shallow, as we move that direction, Paul. So the targets are actually going to be a little shallower below the seafloor than what we're sitting at Maka, Kwaskwasi and even Keskesi. So it's shallowing which is actually a pretty good thing from a maturity standpoint.
Paul Cheng : Okay. And that for next year, the CapEx of $1 billion for maintaining the U.S. production spread and modest decline in loss in Egypt. But of course, that benefits on the top. So without the top benefit, what's that number may look like?
John Christmann : Well, there's 2 things, Paul. Number one, you have to look at we're spending quite a bit of money on exploration in our CapEx. And so we're making a conscious decision to put the money into Suriname, which we could be putting into that base business. I can assure you the money going into Suriname is more than what it would cost to run those 2 frac crews. So you step back and think about the decision we're making on the exploration investment, that's capital we're putting in the -- which could be putting into the base, but we're making a long-term decision because we think there's going to be much, much greater benefit when you get 3, 4 years out.
Paul Cheng : No, fully understand the decision, but I'm just curious what that number if we're saying that in 2021 on the sustaining CapEx without the benefit of top. And also one on Suriname, I thought, Total carry you for 87.5%. So your CapEx to that shouldn't be that much, is it?
John Christmann : Well, but the Total carry actually kicks in on the appraisal work. And so we're going to have 2 rigs running. So there will be exploration activity at a pace. It's pretty similar to what we've been spending this year, right? And then the appraisal capital kicks in. And on that, we will be paying 12.5% on the appraisal work.
Paul Cheng : Okay. Two final questions. First, if the oil price end up next year swing much better than the $40 WTI base budget, how that may impact if it does on your 2021 CapEx and the activity level? And then last one...
John Christmann : Yes. I mean, clearly, our priority there is going to be debt repayment. I mean there's more with the $1 billion or less number we've kind of laid out for 2021, that's predicated on $40. If prices are higher, you're going to see us continue to prioritize debt repayment. But there are some things we'd like to get to more capital in Egypt is something that would be a priority for us. But that's going to be the big thing. And then I think you'd have to get quite a bit higher before we start thinking about rig lines in the Permian.
Paul Cheng : Okay. And final one, that partly, actually, even though the price looks very depressed, but they trade at a higher multiple compared to most of your E&P peers. Does it make sense from that standpoint to use this relative premium currency to acquire company with a maybe better near-term cash flow and balance sheet? I mean I don't think you need to acquire company for growth. But that may allow you to have additional room of cost reduction and also improve your balance sheet also more maybe at serving rigs.
John Christmann : No. It's been a busy time, and we've seen a lot of transactions happen out there on the M&A front. I think as you alluded to with how we're trading, we're in a pretty unique position where we've got a potential company-changing exploration block that we feel like actually, there's a lot more potential there than is reflected on our share price. As we think about things, clearly, we're focused on paying down debt. You see we're really aggressively managing our cost structure, working on the breakevens. But I think from our perspective, we've got to make sure something would really makes sense for our shareholders and protect the shareholders because we see a lot of upside potential on a relative basis with our share price just because of the potential in Suriname. So you can't stick your head in the sand, you have to keep your eyes open, but we're going to be very cognizant of shareholder value.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Charles Meade of Johnson Rice.
Charles Meade : I have 1 quick question and then maybe a bigger follow-up. John, I didn't hear you address it in your prepared comments. I apologize if I missed, but did you give a timeline when we expect a decision or announcement on your Keskesi well you're on right now?
John Christmann : Well, we did not, Charles. We're drilling ahead. We did run into some hole stability problems in the upper portion. We've since sidetracked. We've set pipe and we're getting ready to move ahead. We have not got down into any of deeper zones yet but the wells are in really good shape, and we're anxious to move forward. So -- but we're not going to lay out a timeline, but it's -- things are going well.
Charles Meade : Good. I appreciate that color. That's helpful, John. And then the follow-up, back to this Bonboni. And as you can imagine, we all have a lot more questions and you probably want to answer about it right now, but you've already painted a little bit of the picture here, in that it's the same Campanian, Santonian intervals you're targeting there, but they're in a shallower -- they're shallower because it's -- you've got some, I guess, basin thing going away. Can you talk about -- you also mentioned that they're kind of the same setting. So can you talk about whether these are -- I would expect these are more eerily large basin floor features as you move in that Northeast direction, but is that a fair inference to make? Or is there anything else you can talk about the different kind of play versus what you've established already with your string of 4 wells?
John Christmann : No. I mean -- and I can answer 1 of the questions on the water depth. I think we're in about 2,000 meters of water with Bonboni. So what you've got happening is as we said, they're very significant independent features. You've got turbidite fan systems. But -- so what you're giving up is a little bit of -- you're kind of trading some of the water depth for depth of the formation. So they do shallow a little bit, which we think is going to be a positive for maturity. But they're big, Charles, and that's what we want to say at this point. We need to go out and explore, right? But we're excited about them. They look fantastic on seismic. They're sizable and there's just a lot of ground to cover between Maka, Kwaskwasi, Sapakara and Keskesi and as you start to move out just that direction to Bonboni. So -- but Campanian, Santonian, a little shallower, very large features, and then there are some things down below that we might be able to get to as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Scialla of Stifel.
Michael Scialla : Hess mentioned on it's call that there are 5 penetrations in the Santonian, in the basin, your 3 and then 2 on the Stabroek block. And it sounds like currently drilling Exxon exploration well and Guyana is expected to test both the Santonian and the Turonian. Just curious if you're sharing any data with your neighbors there? And if so, anything you can say about what you've learned there about those deeper zones?
John Christmann : Mike, we have not at this point just because after -- other than what Haimara might have done for us, it hasn't been beneficial to us. The -- I think it just shows you the depth and the number of targets we've got. I mean, it's -- the Guyana Basin is turning out to be a super basin. You've got a maturity and source -- multiple source rock that's working. You've got multiple targets. They're high quality, and we've penetrated both the companion and the Santonian with all of ours. And I think a lot of that work will come back with through appraisal when we start to really get into more details about what would be our plans as you move post the appraisal plan. But it just shows you the thickness. It shows you the sand. We had over 900 feet in a Kwaskwasi between the 2 zones. So it just shows you the depth and just what -- how a target-rich this environment is for both.
Michael Scialla : Very good. And can you talk about your decision to complete the DUCs in the Permian rather than to generate more free cash flow? And will all of those be in the Midland Basin? Or are you planning on completing any Alpine High if gas prices continue to improve?
John Christmann : Well, actually, I think the first 3 are going to be Alpine High. So there'll be 3 there and then mainly in the Midland Basin. But I think the big reason to start this now is really we see an opportunity on the service cost. I mean, costs are down significantly from where they were in the first quarter. And I think it's just -- we see it as an opportunity to go ahead and get out there and get them completed, and then it gives us a little bit of flexibility in terms of how you -- how and when you bring them back. So this is driven off of the cost side and their wells that you ultimately are going to complete, and we just see it as a good window to commit, put 2 frac crews to work and go knock these out.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer : To follow up further on Suriname, you made a couple of references here deeper zone or zones below the Santonian. And I wondered if you could talk any more about that and whether what you would potentially down the road or as part of this well at Bonboni test. How applicable those ones are? How prospective those zones could be across Block 58? And then separately, as you think about 2021, can you just remind us on where you see the ratio of exploration wells versus appraisal wells? 
John Christmann : Well, it's the likely going to be more appraisal than exploration, but you're going to see a similar pace with 2 rigs. And so there's going to be multiple exploration wells the best way to say it. But we're going to have the flexibility with both those rigs to do both. So you'll start to see the programs kind of blended as we kind of go out and prioritize things. One other thing I would say is when we started out and did all of our early work, we've seen 8 different play types on Block 58. And to-date, we've tested 2. Two of those, the first 2 were the Campanian and the Santonian. We've seen all -- both of those and all the first 3 wells. We attempted to get down to the Turonian, but we ran into too much pressure in the Santonian at Maka. And so there's clearly -- the Turonian would be 1 of the next targets that we'd like to get to. And it's just a matter of figuring out when and which well we want to do that with. We think there's great potential there. And then there's really 5 other types. You start to get pre and post unconformity and some other things that are even a little bit deeper. But that's for a later conversation later down the road. But there's just a lot here in this block.
Brian Singer : Great. And then my follow-up is with regards to the cash costs. You talked about some of the volatility from quarter-to-quarter and how strong cash costs and LOE was this quarter, but that that's not necessarily sustainable. Can you just remind us again kind of where you see that path and what you kind of see as a sustainable LOE relative to this last quarter and your guidance for the fourth quarter?
John Christmann : Yes. Brian, I think that's a question that's probably, in terms of specific numbers, best left for when we talk about 2021 in more detail, typically in February. But what I would say is that we got after the G&A costs pretty quickly because we knew what we were going to do on an organizational restructure, and we implemented the vast majority of that in the first quarter. And so you saw a significant drop in G&A pretty quickly. LOE takes a bit longer to get organized around that to start attacking the cost and start to see the benefits of that showing up. But clearly, we're seeing a significant reduction in LOE as we're going through -- as we went through the third quarter and into the future, you're going to see more of that. There are some more run rate type of costs that we need to get after. And I think you'll see continued benefit of that as we round the corner into 2021 and even beyond, especially if we stay in this type of price environment. The thing about LOE, as you know, it's just a bit lumpy. And so you get the impacts of things like maintenance spend and turnarounds and pace of workover activity and things like that, that just affect operating costs a lot more than G&A, which tend to be more steady. And on the G&A side, we just get the weird little accruals that we have like this quarter. But I just -- I think instead of giving an accurate number of where we're going on OpEx, LOE on a quarterly basis. Let's see where we're at in February, and we'll give some good context and guidance on 2021 at that point.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Leo Mariani of KeyBanc.
Leo Mariani : I just wanted to follow up a little bit on Suriname here. You certainly talked about starting to get after an appraisal program in 2021. You also talked a couple of times about some of these deeper zones. Do you think that the deeper zones, in particular, the Turonian are going to be part of the appraisal plan already here as you look at a few of the wells, Maka, Sapakara, Kwaskwasi. Is that contemplated already for '21?
John Christmann: At this point, Leo, we don't have -- we haven't explored or gotten down to the Turonian. So It would be early to call it appraisal until we can get down and actually successfully explore. So we'll find a place. Maybe you might take an appraisal well that we decide to deepen and put an exploration tail on it. But we'll just see how we work through that. But right now, we're -- all the appraisal work is going to be in appraised discoveries, which we've already quantified.
Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And I guess you guys obviously laid out a plan to hold your 4Q '20 premium oil volumes flat next year. You talked about kind of modest declines in North Sea and Egypt. Just trying to get a sense, you are running quite a few rigs in Egypt there. If you can kind of help us out with any kind of order of magnitude of those declines? Are we talking kind of 10%, kind of single-digits? What are you guys thinking here for North Sea and Egypt next year?
John Christmann : Yes. I mean I think you look at our base overall decline, both areas is kind of like where North America. It's all around 25%. North America is a combination of our unconventional which is higher and our conventional, which is lower. North Sea is 40s, it is going to be lower. barrels a little higher, but it's in the 25% range. But we will be active there. So it's modest, as we said. And then Egypt is also -- it’s really good conventional rock. On average, our decline rate is probably close to 25% in Egypt. We came into the year running about 10 rigs there and 10 years is -- 10 rigs, you're closer to kind of keeping it, maybe growing it. When we went through the capital cuts, we dropped down to 5. So 5 to 6 is not a lot for when you consider the size of our position, how much production we're making there in terms of the volumes and so forth, it really is -- it's not a lot of activity just for the size, scale, scope of that business. But when we say modest, that means it's less than what our natural base declines would be.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities.
Neal Dingmann : Got to stay away from Suriname like COVID. So my question is on Egypt. You're running pretty -- been running a 5 rig plan now for some time. Is that -- did economics sort of favor that continuous plan? Could you see maybe even adding more activity there? Can you talk maybe a little bit about just the activity in that play?
John Christmann : Yes. Actually, Neal, we came in the year with 10. So we dropped to 5 when we had to cut capital because we cut everywhere, right? It's -- clearly, we've got more activity than we've got cash flow right now to put into Egypt. So the appetite would be for more. But as we're going to -- as we said, we're prioritizing free cash flow, we're prioritizing debt repayment, we're doing that at the corporate level. So Egypt is contributing some free cash flow. It's an area where we could easily double that rig count. But it's going to have to fit into the big mix of how much can we free up to put into Egypt.
Neal Dingmann : No. Okay. Makes sense. And then same thing with just allocation. I mean, I guess, the way price -- gas prices are running any thoughts or just any comments you can make around potentially even minimally revisiting Alpine High?
John Christmann : Yes. I mean like I said, we've got -- on the DUCs, we're going to go knock out, I think, 3 DUCs at Alpine High first because things look pretty good right now from that perspective. But I think in the U.S., it's the place we would get to in a higher price environment. We have optionality there, but it's going to boil down to, once again, prioritizing debt repayment and free cash flow before we start to put incremental capital back to work over what we'll lay out early next year. But clearly, there's a portion of Alpine High that is -- hinges on Henry Hub or Waha pricing, which has definitely improved, and you've seen that in the numbers this quarter. There's a big chunk of it that's really hinges on NGL prices as well. So it's nice to have that optionality in the portfolio. And we'll just have to kind of look at if we were to put more activity work to work in the Permian, based on price decks where it would go into the oil plays in our Midland Delaware or into the gas or NGLs.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mr. David Deckelbaum of Cowen.
David Deckelbaum : Most have been answered today. I just wanted to follow up a little bit just on the DUCs at Alpine High. Are those all in the lean gas window that you'll be completing in the first quarter here?
John Christmann : Yes.
David Deckelbaum : Okay. And then just Altus has proposed a significantly higher dividend, pretty substantial payment back to Apache. Does any of that value creation change the way that you think about developing Alpine High as an operator over the next couple of years?
John Christmann : I think you just got to step back and factor everything in. Clearly, things are -- have improved out there, and we'll just have to kind of factor all that into our math of where we would put capital back to work. But right now, we don't have anything laid out. As we laid out the early look for 2021 at $40 and $2.75, you're not likely going to see any sustained rig programs in the U.S.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Christmann for the concluding remarks.
John Christmann : Thank you, operator. I'd like to leave you with the following key thoughts: Oil and gas, when produced and delivered in a safe and environmentally conscious manner, dramatically improves the quality of life around the world and lifts hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. As energy production systems continue to evolve, a robust competitive, innovative and cleaner U.S. energy industry will be necessary for decades to come. Apache plans to remain focused on its core business, and we will work continuously to deliver positive impacts on the air, water and communities in which we live and operate. While our industry continues to face many short-term macro headwinds, Apache's strategy has not changed. We are maintaining a flexible capital allocation approach across our diversified portfolio, generating free cash flow, reducing debt and continuously working to lower our cost structure. And lastly, we are choosing to fund a differential large-scale opportunity in Suriname rather than invest in short-cycle projects that maintain or grow production in the short-term. As current commodity prices do not offer attractive enough returns to justify doing so. Thank you for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our progress in the future.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-30 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Apache Corporation’s Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Announcement Webcast. At this time, all participants’ are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker’s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.
Gary Clark: Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation’s Second Quarter Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by; CEO and President, John Christmann; Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO will then summarize our first quarter financial performance; Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development will also be available on the call to answer questions. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 15 minutes in lengths with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday’s press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our second quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today’s call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally, I’d like to remind everyone that today’s discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us. For the last several months, the world and the global E&P industry have been facing one of the most challenging environments in recent history. Apache is responding with decisive actions designed to protect our people, our assets, our investors and the communities, in which we operate. And I want to take this opportunity to thank the many Apache employees and contractors for their hard work and dedication in these tough times. In my prepared remarks this morning, I will discuss the progress we made during the second quarter and review our key objectives and capital priorities going forward. I'd like to begin with a brief update on our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Apache moved quickly to implement a wide range of fit for purpose protocols to ensure a safe and productive work environment in both our onshore and offshore operations. Thankfully we have experienced a relatively small number of COVID-19 cases and have incurred no material operational disruptions beyond our intentional production curtailments. We are prepared to maintain our current work model for as long as necessary. Since the onset of the pandemic we have been listening and responding to the specific needs of the communities, in which we work and live. Apache has donated PPE and critical medical equipment to hospitals and first responders, as well as supporting food banks. long distance learning initiatives, and shelters for women and children. From an operational and financial perspective, during the second quarter, we executed our planned activity reductions on schedule and delivered upstream CapEx well below guidance of $230 million. For the full year, we are now tracking toward the lower end of our capital guidance range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. The majority of our organizational redesign has been implemented, achieving combined run rate, LOE and overhead savings of more than $300 million as planned. Net of severance and restructuring costs, actual cash savings realized in 2020 are estimated to be approximately $225 million. Through these and other actions we have reduced our free cash flow breakeven oil price to be around $30 per barrel on a forward-looking basis. This allows us to protect our current financial position and enables positive free cash flow in the current price environment. And in Block 58 Offshore Suriname during the second quarter, we submitted a plan of appraisal for our first discovery mockup announced our second discovery at Sapakara and spudded our third exploration well Kwaskwasi, the results of which we announced yesterday in conjunction with our earnings release. We are thrilled with the results from the Kwaskwasi-1 exploration well. This is the best well we've drilled in the basin to date with the highest net pay and the best quality reservoirs. While we have a lot more work to do, a discovery of this quality and magnitude merits a pace of evaluation that enables the option of accelerated first production. Following Kwaskwasi the Noble Sam Croft drillship will move to the fourth well in our 2020 exploration program, Keskesi. After, which Apache will transition operatorship of the block to our partner Total. Turning now to the curtailment program. We have returned our North Sea and Alpine High volumes to production along with a portion of curtailed oil volumes in the Permian. We anticipate that several thousand barrels of higher cost Permian oil production may remain offline for the rest of 2020. Apache is currently running one exploratory rig in Suriname, five rigs in Egypt, and one floating rig and one platform rig in the North Sea. We intend to maintain this activity set for the remainder of the year if commodity prices do not deteriorate significantly. At this time in the Permian Basin, we have no drilling or completions activity and no plans to complete our DUCs for the remainder of the year. As we look at the second half of 2020 into the long-term, our key objectives remain unchanged despite the extreme price volatility. We will budget conservatively and direct free cash flow on a priority basis to debt reduction maintain a balanced and diversified portfolio and prioritize investment for long-term returns over production growth. We have spoken frequently about our priority ranking for capital deployment within the portfolio, and our thoughts on this are worth reiterating. At the top of the list is Suriname, which will continue to receive priority funding for both exploration and appraisal activity. Under the terms of our joint venture, the incremental cost to Apache associated with appraisal and ultimately development should be very manageable. Our second priority is Egypt, where the PSC structure offers more stable returns in relatively low and more volatile oil price environments. Following that, we should look to complete our DUCs in the Permian Basin and resume drilling with a second platform rig in the North Sea. And finally, while our Permian operations have been delivering highly competitive economics within the basin, other areas within our portfolio offer more attractive investment options in a capital-constrained environment. Therefore, we don't envision returning rigs to the Permian Basin unless oil prices recover well into the $50s. We have always stated that our best hedge against price volatility is prudent and responsive management of the capital program. To the extent, oil prices are sustained at/or below $50 per barrel WTI, we do not anticipate a material change in our annual capital budget from the current rate of around $1 billion. For oil prices significantly below $50 capital spending is more likely to be reduced from the $1 billion mark. If oil prices rise above $50, we will be very measured with our capital increases and the first column that incremental free cash flow will be returned to investors initially with debt reduction. I'd like to close by summarizing Apache's approach to managing the unprecedented challenges thus far in 2020. We implemented successful COVID-19 operating protocols and work-from-home procedures and helped ease the burden of the pandemic on our host communities in numerous ways. We responded to the sudden price drop by quickly limiting cash outflows to protect our balance sheet. This included a significant reduction in capital, dividends and overhead and operating costs. These along with other actions have enabled us to lower our free cash flow breakeven such that we now have good visibility to debt reduction. Operationally, we have preserved optionality to reactivate our curtailed production, development programs and other investment opportunities when appropriate. And we have successfully advanced our exploration program in Suriname. Through these and other actions, particularly the successful implementation of our corporate redesign, we entered the second half of 2020 a very focused and streamlined organization. The benefits of our diversified portfolio are more evident now than ever as we flex capital towards our international operations. Together, with our world-class position in Suriname, Apache offers a truly differentiated investment opportunity within an industry that has come under tremendous pressure. I would like to again thank all the Apache employees for their commitment, resilience, hard work and flexibility as we successfully navigate these challenging times. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney.
Steve Riney: Thank you, John. On today's call, I will review second quarter 2020 results, discuss progress on our cost-saving initiatives, and provide commentary on our free cash flow outlook and debt management efforts. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, Apache reported a second quarter 2020 consolidated net loss of $386 million or $1.02 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which are, an unrealized loss on derivatives, a tax valuation allowance, and asset impairments, partially offset by a gain on the repurchase of outstanding debt. Excluding these and other smaller items, the adjusted loss was $281 million or $0.74 per share. Adjusted production decreased 7% from the prior quarter, primarily driven by shut-ins and production curtailments of approximately 190,00 BOEs per day at Alpine High, and production curtailments of 10,000 BOEs per day in the North Sea and 6,000 BOEs per day for other operations in the Permian. Partially offsetting this was increased Egypt cost recovery volumes due to the lower oil prices in the quarter. Apache's second quarter average realized price on a BOE basis fell 39% from the prior quarter, with oil and NGL prices down materially. International oil price realizations were notably weak, as actual price realizations dislocated from the published benchmark price. This discount was driven by unprecedented excess supply on the market, resulting in unusual competitive pricing dynamics. Consequently, second quarter international oil realizations averaged around $5.50 per barrel below the benchmark, which we do not customarily experience. So far in the third quarter, Brent pricing has reconnected with the benchmark and we do not currently anticipate this changing. Turning now to our cost savings initiatives. We entered 2020 with a goal of reducing annualized overhead and LOE costs by at least $150 million. With the price downturn in March, we took quick action to double that goal to at least $300 million. We have since fully achieved this target and then some. Roughly 2/3 of the targeted savings are coming from overhead reductions, and 1/3 from direct LOE reductions. These are sustainable cost reductions, and they are showing up in multiple places on our financial statements. So let me provide some detail. Of the roughly $200 million of annualized overhead cash cost reductions, approximately $100 million will show up as reduced capital investment. $20 million will come in the form of reductions in LOE and exploration expense, and approximately $80 million will show up in lower G&A expense. So our underlying G&A expense, which in the recent past typically ran about $100 million per quarter, should now run around $80 million per quarter. During the first quarter of 2020, you will recall we had a nearly $30 million reduction in G&A expense caused by the mark-to-market effect on share-based compensation plans associated with the significant negative movement in our stock price. During the second quarter, this impact partially reversed, generating a $19 million increase in G&A expense. As a result, second quarter G&A expense was $94 million. Turning now to LOE, we have eliminated approximately $100 million of direct LOE costs on an annualized basis. In addition to these sustainable LOE reductions, we are also seeing cost reductions associated with production curtailments and deferred workovers as well as the deferral of certain other nonessential activities. While these actions reduce costs in the near term, they are not sustainable, and we expect at least a portion of them to return at some point in the future. As we have previously noted, one of our key long-term objectives is debt reduction. Let me share two views on this objective as we look at the second quarter. With respect to long-term debt, we took the opportunity to repurchase bonds at significant discounts when the debt markets came under pressure. In aggregate, during the second quarter, we repurchased $410 million of face value debt for $263 million, reducing aggregate long-term debt by $147 million. The repurchase debt had an average remaining term of approximately 20 years and at the purchase price, had an average yield of 9%, making this a very attractive investment. Another view of debt is through the borrowings on our revolver. Between the negative cash flow impacts of the extremely low price environment and the $263 million of bond repurchases, we ended the quarter with $565 million outstanding on the revolver. With an improving second half price outlook, combined with lower capital investment and reduced operating and overhead costs, we anticipate generating positive free cash flow in the second half and using it to reduce borrowings on the revolver. Before wrapping up, I'd like to note that we did issue third quarter guidance yesterday in our financial and operational supplement on our website, which covers our outlook for capital investment and production as well as a number of expense items. In summary, although it was a very challenging quarter from a price and cash flows perspective, we took significant actions to reduce our cost structure, protect the balance sheet and retain asset value for the future. To the extent WTI oil prices remain above $30 per barrel, we look forward to generating free cash flow in the second half of 2020 and using that to reduce leverage. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Doug Leggate: Sorry, guys. I was on mute. I couldn’t get my mute button to go off. I apologize. Good morning, everyone. John, this is also a great day for your stock, and congratulations on the latest discovery in Suriname. I'm obviously going to focus my two questions on that, if I may. So my first one is your comment in the press release about this deserves perhaps the option of an accelerated first production. My question is, what influence does Apache have over that? How aligned is Total? And what are the parameters within the contract that could get you to that? And I guess what I'm really aiming for is, would you consider an early production system here? And I've got a follow-up.
John Christmann: Well, Doug, thank you, first of all. I think in the end, it's just going to boil down to the quality of the well and the rock and the play, when you step back and look, Block 58, 1.4 million acres. To put it in perspective, it's over 250 Gulf of Mexico blocks. We've now drilled 3 wells in 3 different fairways. And I use that context to help you understand why you can have 3 very large fairways. We're going to be moving to another one with Keskesi once we conclude operations. The comments in the press release kind of speak for themselves. With where we sit, I think that our partner is also excited. We've done some things in the Campanian, with this well, we gained -- collected some extra data. We're doing some things with an exploration well that you typically would not do, which helps us gain some insight into what we've got. And so we'll -- in the end, it's going to boil down to us being aligned with our partner. And of course, aligned with the Staatsolie and the government of Suriname in terms of the pace and moving it forward. But I think in the end, it's going to be the quality of the rock and the resource potential that's going to drive that.
Doug Leggate: Pardon my follow-up on this -- that question, John, but Total just don't seem to be communicating the same level of urgency, I guess, as your comment in the press release. So I just wonder if you could help us bridge the gap between the two, given the...
John Christmann: Well, I think, what all my comment says is that, it's of a quality that would look at an accelerated pace. I think in their press release today they stated that, there will be an appraisal and exploration program early next year to appraise our discovery. So I'll just leave it at that.
Doug Leggate: Okay. My follow-up is also on Kwaskwasi. And it's related to the deeper Santonian. Obviously you did not disclose anything other than hydrocarbon reservoir. The last thing we heard of that expression it was gas condensate at Haimara and Guyana. So I'm just wondering if you can address some concerns out there, as to what the hydrocarbon type is. Why you didn't release APIs? What do you know about scale? And just any other ways you can characterize that deeper horizon? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.
John Christmann: Yeah. The thing I'll say is, if you look at the first two wells, the Santonian has been more oily than the Campanian. So I will tell you everything looks good here. We are in a position, because we had done some additional work in the upper zones. And set pipe in the Campanian that we had a lot of that -- all that information. There is still more that we are collecting here but we felt like we were at a position with the materiality that we should talk about it. I'll let Dave to give a little more color on the Santonian there.
Dave Pursell: Yeah. Thanks John. So Doug, John talked about some additional testing in the Campanian. So it's important from a timing perspective we did some additional deeper investigation-type testing. And it does two things for us. It gives us a composite flow capacity and allows us to see a little deeper in the reservoir than conventional fluid testing allows. So we've -- we're through the Santonian. We have the conventional wireline logs collected. Based on our experience with the mud logging and the open-hole wireline logging, on Maka, Sapakara and the Campanian in this well, we feel confident that we have oil, in significant portion of the Santonian. So we felt like, we were fine with releasing. We still have work to do. We still have to collect fluids and pressures. We have core data to collect. And we anticipate doing some of the additional deeper investigation testing, on this interval. So I wouldn't read too much into the fact that we don't have -- we didn't release API gravities because we don't have those collected yet.
Doug Leggate: Thanks. Congrats again. And I look forward to next quarter. Thanks.
Dave Pursell: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Scialla with Stifel.
Mike Scialla: Yeah. Good morning and brilliant and congratulations as well. I was curious on Kwaskwasi the results there how those compared to expectations? Was there any indication from your seismic data that this well would have more than double the net pay of the other two?
John Christmann: Yeah, Mike, first of all, thank you. I mean when you look at the seismic we knew Kwaskwasi was going to be a prolific fairway, as the other two were. It boils down a little bit about the depositional environment. I mean once again, we're in such a large area and these wells are so far apart, that you have to drill them to learn that. So I mean clearly, it exceeded what would have been pre-drill. But we knew there was that kind of potential. And there is -- the exciting thing about it is we've got a lot more of this block to explore, but clearly, very excited about it.
Mike Scialla: Good. And then, Stephen, you mentioned about prioritizing that you want to improve the balance sheet obviously. I was wondering how you would prioritize options there? Is it really just using free cash flow to pay down debt or any other options you've considered at this point?
Steve Riney: Yeah, Mike. I think, in a more typical environment you'd see companies selling assets to strengthen the balance sheet to pay down debt. And I think it's clear that, in the price environment we're in right now that just doesn't work. And so for the most part, it is going to be the old-fashioned way of retaining free cash flow spending a little bit less on capital which we all ought to be doing. And that just means it will take some time to get the balance sheet in order unless there's a price spike or some -- there will be the occasional one-off opportunities where you have a chance to do something to reduce debt similar to what we did in the second quarter with repurchasing some debt at a discount. And we'll take advantage of those from time-to-time. But I do believe this is just a simple case of prioritizing retaining free cash flow and using it to pay down debt instead of spending it on capital to maybe achieve a different type of growth profile. Clearly for us, strengthening the balance sheet is going to be much more important than growing production volume. And I think we're now approaching a period, where we're going to be able to do that. We've -- as John mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're now capable of running free cash flow neutral at $30 WTI on a point forward basis for the rest of this year, with the CapEx budget where it is, with the dividend cut, the overhead cuts, the LOE cuts, some of the other things that we've done. We have no intention of raising the capital budget for this year. And that's what we'll do. And to the extent that oil price exceeds $30 WTI, we'll use any excess free cash flow that that generates to reduce debt.
Mike Scialla: Very good, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.
Bob Brackett: Hi. Good morning. I'm intrigued a bit by the comments around, doing some things with an exploration, well that you wouldn't typically do in the deeper investigation type testing. Are you performing a mini drill stem test out there? And are there any rates to report?
Dave Pursell: Yes. Bob this is Dave Pursell. Good try. We – it's something that would be between – if you want to call them mini drill stem tests that would be a reasonable characterization. It's something between a full drill stem test and what you typically would get from a fluid sampling operation. So again what we're getting from this is composite flow capacity of a – instead of a point permeability measurement from a core sample, we're getting a composite flow capacity and then another benefit is some deeper investigation for pressures into the reservoir. So we're still evaluating that data. But that's what we're doing. And again, we anticipate performing those tests in the Santonian as well.
Bob Brackett: Okay. Yes. That's clear. Another question. Given the thickness of this recent discovery, what drove the sequencing of the overall exploration campaign? And what might that tell us about the fourth well?
John Christmann: I mean I think when you step back and look, as we said we had multiple fairways. I think there – and you look at the size and think about this it's equivalent of 250 Gulf of Mexico blocks. So moving across there. A lot of it has to do just with how the – how things were deposited. But we've got a full another fairway that it will be testing. So we're anxious to move over and see. But everything looks really good on the seismic. So we're anxious to move on to Keskesi after Kwaskwasi.
Bob Brackett: Appreciate it.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles Meade: Good morning, John, you and your whole team there.
John Christmann: Good morning, Charles.
Charles Meade: I'm asking another question on the relief the headline that everyone is focused on the thickness of the pad that you guys found with this well. I'm curious, is there anything going on with either the dip of these sort of formations or perhaps structurally that's some kind of mitigating factor for that thickness you announced? Or is this more the case where you guys just really found a thick stack of pancakes here?
John Christmann: I would just say it's really more depositionally. There's nothing tricky with it. Geology is pretty level out here. So it's very exciting. I think it just goes to the quality in the Cretaceous here both with the Campanian and the Santonian. So as we've said, there are other play types that we are still looking forward to testing. The Turonian is a target we had at Maka. There's more to do. We've really – with the Campanian and Santonian, we're really only fully starting to evaluate two of the play types, we think there's seven or eight – so there's multiple targets. So a lot of exploration to do. And obviously, we got a lot of appraisal work to do on these first three discoveries.
Charles Meade: Well, John, you anticipated my follow-up question on the Turonian because I remember back, you guys certainly have plenty to say grace over here but going back to that first well, the Maka well that you guys had some encouragement with the Turonian. So does – is that something that we should anticipate you guys are going to – are you going to maybe test with your next well? Or is that something that's where you found enough in the Campanian and Santonian that that's kind of receded into 2021 or beyond?
John Christmann: Well just the timing of how – if you look Charles, we're really still moving across one direction across this block with these first four wells. We haven't even started to move the other direction which would be north and south. So we're going to – Keskesi, obviously move to the other side of Sapakara. So we'll talk about that with the future exploration wells.
Charles Meade: Got it. Thanks for the color, John.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. 
Jeanine Wai: Hi, good morning, everyone.
John Christmann: Good morning.
Jeanine Wai: I've got two questions on Suriname starting. But I guess my first question is just on the reservoir quality. And the second is just on the accelerated first production commentary. So based on what you've seen so far from the Kwaskwasi well, can you provide a little more color on what makes the reservoir at one of the best quality reservoirs that you've ever seen in the basins? And is it primarily just the net feet to pay? Or are there other characteristics that you can elaborate on?
John Christmann: I'd just say in general, it's better. It's better if you look at the one net fee to pay both in the Santonian and in the Campanian are greater than we had in the first two wells combined. So that's one element. But I'll also tell you the quality looks fantastic. So at this point that's all we're going to say about it.
Jeanine Wai: Okay. I can appreciate that. And then my follow-up question. In terms of the potential for accelerated first production relative to the current plan which to our understanding I think was something around four development wells and four exploration wells a year. Is the thought that maybe you could shift some exploration CapEx, development Capex? Or do you envision doing more than the four plus four wells? I know it's still early but I'm also not sure if there's anything in the PSC that allows for some timing flexibility.
John Christmann: Yes. I mean, what I would say is I don't know where the four appraisal or four development wells came from. We're drilling four exploration wells this year. Under the terms of our joint venture us and our partner can each propose four exploration wells so there could be eight going forward. What we've stated is there will be both an appraisal program and an exploration program in 2021 and we plan to try to get started as early as we can. So clearly the comment is with what we've got and some of the things we're doing here, this is of a quality and magnitude that it would warrant trying to look at could it be accelerated is all we're saying.
Jeanine Wai: Okay. Great. Thank you, very much.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Freeman with Raymond James. 
John Freeman: Hi guys.
John Christmann: Good morning, John.
John Freeman: So, I wanted to focus on the capital allocation. You have been pretty clear about the balance sheet being the first priority and then kind of Suriname, Egypt, North Sea, Permian sort of that order. And the slide that you have got in your presentation sort of lays it out at different kind of price tags how that capital gets allocated. And John, you were very clear in your prepared remarks that it's going to take an oil price well over $50 to put a rig back to work in the Permian. But I guess, I'm curious with sort of where the current strip is which is just barely above $40, it's kind of right on the line there between, if you do anything in the North Sea, if you would potentially draw down DUCs in the Permian. And I guess, what I'm going towards is with this continued success in Suriname and everything you want to do there and what's -- and the continued run in Egypt, if maybe the gap has sort of widened between those two assets versus the other two where maybe at a low price is just barely above $40, it maybe doesn't make sense maybe to put the capital of those last two relative to the others? Like is there part of the pie now getting bigger I guess?
John Christmann: Yes. John, a really good question. I think the first thing I would say is in my prepared remarks, I laid out too that with where the strip is today CapEx probably comes down for the whole in '21. And that's just because of how we prioritize things. As it relates to the pie, Suriname, the way we structured our joint venture, it really doesn't change, how much capital we have to put into Suriname. So, clearly it's just going to boil down to how much capital do we want to spend. And with where the strip sits today, I really think that the CapEx budget is going to come down because, we're going to want to generate some free cash flow that can go towards reducing our debt.
John Freeman: Great. And then just the last question for me. With this latest result in Suriname and everything you're doing there, just internally relative to how you were thinking about the mix of kind of appraisal and exploration in Suriname next year, does this change that mix? I'm not telling you to give me the actual breakdown because you haven't probably determined that yet, but just does it change your thought process of how that mix would have been prior to this result?
John Christmann: It really doesn't because I mean we've been -- I think, we understand the potential there. Clearly, there's things we're going to want to try to move forward on an accelerated pace if we can, but we also have a very large block that we have to continue to explore. And so, we're going to want to continue exploring. I think the exploration pace will be pretty similar to what it is today. And then, it will just be a function of what we need to do on the appraisal side with our partner.
John Freeman: Thanks, John. I appreciate it and congrats.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson with Stephens.
Gail Nicholson: Good morning. Congratulations on another great Suriname well.
John Christmann: Thanks Gail and good morning to you.
Gail Nicholson: When you guys look at Egypt activity in the second half of the year, could you just talk about any exploration targets that you guys are looking for to tackling?
John Christmann: I mean, Gail, we're -- we continue to work Egypt hard. And we've shot a big -- a very large 3D there. We continue to high-grade our inventory. We do have some interesting things that are on the schedule that we're anxious to drill some stratigraphic targets. And at some point, if they work like we think they could work then there will be some things to talk about.
Gail Nicholson: Great. And then Steve, in the first quarter call, you talked about a cash flow sensitivity that for every dollar move in oil was in the -- roughly in the $50 million to $60 million range. Is that still a good proxy to use? Or has that improved?
Steve Riney: No, that's still a pretty good proxy to use for every dollar around -- probably close to the $60.
Gail Nicholson: Great. Thank you.
John Christmann: Thank you, Gail.
Operator: Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase.
Arun Jayaram: Good morning. John, I was wondering if you could maybe as a follow-up to John's question, just give us some thoughts on your plans to delineate the three discoveries you've announced thus far and thoughts on potentially bringing in additional drilling rig to the theater call it next year or beyond?
John Christmann: Yes. Arun, I'll just say, we have a kind of a procedure through the concessions that we follow. And we have submitted the appraisal plan for Maka. We are working on the appraisal plan for Sapakara. There will be one that follows Kwaskwasi and clearly there's going to be an appraisal program that starts in early '21. And at this point, that's all I'm at liberty to really say, but we look forward to getting after it.
Arun Jayaram: Great. Great. And just a follow-up regarding Egypt, you guys have talked about the new licensing areas. I was wondering if you guys have processed seismic on your legacy position as well and perhaps a little bit more detail on when you plan to test the stratigraphic trap play concept that I think you've identified in the Ptah and Berenice discoveries back in 2014?
John Christmann: Yes. I mean, it's -- really it's -- Ptah and Berenice it really kicked off this whole effort. Prior to drilling those wells, we'd shot new 3D in 2013. They were on our legacy acreage position called offset. It really opened our eyes to the fact that we needed to start looking stratigraphically not just structurally in Egypt. We had found some things that were stratigraphic in nature through some of the wells that we had drilled in the past. But it really had us design the 3D, which we've been shooting and obviously we picked up new acreage and are shooting that over a lot of our old legacy as well, so a lot of prospectivity. We've got some wells that we're pretty excited to drill. And the nice thing about those is their vertical. They're onshore and there are the other wells we're drilling. So we can do them pretty quickly. It's just a matter of working through all the details and prioritizing. The rig count there we've also reduced. We're currently at five. We'd like to spend more there, if we could, so.
Arun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.
Scott Hanold: Yes. Thanks. On Suriname, a great discovery and congratulations, by the way. Does that discovery really say anything about the positioning or your read of the seismic that you have over some of the other fairways like the Maka, for example, i.e. is there the chance that you guys now see the opportunity for like thicker structures other places? Is there anything unique that you found with that well? 
John Christmann: Yes. I mean, Scott, good question. I mean, I think, what you're learning too and is what we're learning, we've still got work to do. We'll continue to reprocess seismic. There are some carbonates and some things that make it harder. We're fairly deep here, as you saw with the TD that we announced in this well. So we're going to continue to work that. I mean it's -- I think what it really points out is just the vast size as you move from these first three wells between them and the size of the block. So we're going to get smarter with the reprocessing to better understand everything and put it all together. But the good news is, we've got a massive hydrocarbon system. Its working, its oil and we've got good reservoir in the Santonian and in the Campanian. So we'll learn more as we go and as we really start to drill wells. We've just drilled three. So with -- we'll learn more as we go. 
Scott Hanold: And effectively, as far as Keskesi goes in terms of where that was positioned, is there any chance that shifts a little bit as you continue to get closer to that? Or is that location pretty well set at this point? 
John Christmann: No. I mean, as we stated, we had I think nine wells permitted. We knew we would drill three for sure; likely, the fourth was the option we exercised. So there were -- we've got five other locations out there that were picked. Could be appraisal could be others so -- other exploration targets. But we've stick in with where the original wells were on most of these. I mean, it's Sapakara, we moved over one. So as you go and you learn more, you set yourself up to try to get smarter. But it's going to take some more work with the seismic to really change some of the interpretation that we did on the front end.
Scott Hanold: Understood. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer: Thank you and good morning.
John Christmann: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Singer: Sticking with Suriname, how many combined appraisal wells at the three discoveries do you think are needed between moving forward with the codified development plan? And when you think about the appraisal plus the time to get to FID and any government approvals, what's the realistic timing for when we could see early production start-up and a realistic timing, if we see more normal production start up?
John Christmann: Well, I mean, I'd say, that number one, we'll determine the number of appraisal wells that we need through the program. So -- and we're working on that. So I really don't have anything to say other than there's going to be a program and obviously, we've got three discoveries to appraise and there will be contingency wells as we work through those appraisal programs that you'll have with those. Time line, we said normal process you're probably in the four to five range, in terms of years. Obviously, there’re ways that that could be accelerated, but I'm not ready to comment on anything at this point in terms of putting anything out there. I mean we're -- it's all fresh. We've got the log. We're working through this with our partner. We're working on right now, the Sapakara appraisal plan. And then, we're going to get after the Kwaskwasi appraisal plan following that pretty quickly so…
Brian Singer: Great. And then my follow-up is with regard to gas condensate. As you get more data on the gas condensate potential, how are you and your partner considering the potential if at all, for gas condensate development and economics? And is there any scale benefits from discoveries that you've made as well as in the Stabroek block of Guyana for a larger industry partnership? 
Dave Pursell: Yes, Brian, this is Dave Pursell. I think it's premature to go down any details on that. But the way I think you could think about it is, the oil is going to drive the initial development here. And then gas or gas condensate development is beyond that kind of a phase two, if you will. And, obviously, there'd be some scale benefit in the basin, if that were an option. But we're -- there's a long fairway between here and that determination.
Brian Singer: Makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities.
Richard Tullis: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. And, John, congratulations on the big discovery. Two quick questions. With no plans to resume domestic activity until oil prices are considerably higher, what are your current views on potentially monetizing any of the U.S. assets at this point? 
John Christmann: I mean, I'd just say with the portfolio, we're always working the portfolio. We're always looking at how we improve. When we look at our acreage positions out in the Permian specifically, the good news is, we don't have a lot of wells. We have to drill the whole acreage. In fact, mostly everything is HBD [ph]. So we've been looking at working swaps and things to improve our lateral fit in terms of drillable -- lateral feet. And then, I mean, it's -- we're always watching and looking and evaluating the portfolio. I'll just say what we typically do is, just come back and talk to the market after we've done things, rather than setting out expectations or anything on the front end.
Richard Tullis: All right. Thank you. And then just lastly, I know, we've been provided a good bit of information on the thickness of the three discoveries. Any initial thoughts on the aerial extent of any of the three discoveries at this point? 
John Christmann: Thoughts are that -- I mean, it's --we're -- they're very sizable, but we haven't given any color. And we haven't started to put any acreage size on any of these at this point. And I think it's premature. It's something we'd come back with after we've done the appraisal programs. 
Richard Tullis: Okay. That’s all from me. Thank you. 
John Christmann: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. 
Neal Dingmann: Hello. John or Steve my question is just wondering with the pace of next year's appraisal plan at Suriname would that have any impact on your decisions on domestic or international play spending? 
John Christmann: In the way we structured our joint venture, we've kind of got everything worked in and planned around. I mean that was the main reason we held on to 100% of this block and really farm down 50% because we are really setting ourselves up for success because we believe there was a tremendous amount of potential and thought very likely we would find ourselves in this position. And so that's how we structured it. So it's really not going to create an incremental capital call that we can't fund it really at any price. Now you get into second quarter where we got -- all bets are off, but really in an even sub-$30 world we will be focused on paying down debt and funding Suriname. 
Neal Dingmann: Got it. And then just last question just on Egypt. I'm just wondering you mentioned that you'd probably stay the course if pricing stayed around here. Is there -- just kind of wondering if you could talk about any price sensitivity that would cause you to change that? 
John Christmann: No, Egypt works really well. I mean -- and quite frankly, that the driver there is how much free cash flow do we think we can spend and invest there. I would like to spend more because we've got a lot of prospectivity there and it works quite well. So we'll be looking to try to spend more money in Egypt if we possibly can. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. 
Leo Mariani: Hey. Thanks, guys. Just wanted to kind of get a little bit more color around some of the comments you made with respect to CapEx. I think you guys specifically said that it's $50 you'd spend at or below the $1 billion as we work our way into next year. And I just wanted to get a sense, I mean, it seems to me that that level of capital you're going to see steady production declines in all three of your areas, sort of, Egypt, North Sea and Permian. Just wanted to kind of confirm that with you guys. And then if that is the case then are you guys just feeling comfortable with that just because of the great initial success in Suriname? Or you just think that the long-term economics in Suriname are going to be so good you're fine letting things blow down for a handful of years until this kind of kicks in? 
John Christmann: No, Leo I mean, I think, the point is we're managing the company for free cash flow and long-term returns. And it's not about production growth. I mean, obviously, we're not spending at a level today that would be maintaining production. We do know from past history that as you go forward with us with our decline rates some of these conventional assets really start to arrest that decline. So it would take more in the future, but it's a matter of priorities of how we're managing the company. And I think some of these other assets some of the things you talked about they're going to hold up pretty well with under investment. 
Leo Mariani: Okay. And I guess just with respect to your third quarter production guidance here you guys have the kind of adjusted international production of 135,000 BOE per day and kind of the upstream CapEx of $190 million. I want to see if you guys could provide those numbers on a kind of fully consolidated basis. So what would those be if we didn't make those kind of downward adjustments for the Egypt non-controlling interest in midstream and other things. 
Steve Riney: Yes. Leo, we -- I don't have those numbers to hand. So I'd suggest maybe you call Gary to take a look at the reported volumes. We typically talk about adjusted because those are the ones that have a true economic effect for Apache shareholders, but I understand the desire to know what the reported numbers might be. So if you want to talk to Gary about that that would be probably the best source.
Leo Mariani: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum with Cowen. 
David Deckelbaum: Good morning, guys and congrats. 
John Christmann: Thank you. 
David Deckelbaum: Just curious you've spoken quite a bit about obviously, Suriname. You talked about your capital allocation priorities as commodities improve and the emphasis on free cash. There were reports, I guess, earlier in the month or perhaps last month about Apache's potential interest in some other North Sea assets. If we think about Apache just as a portfolio company now, should we be expecting you look at opportunistic acquisitions that would increase your free cash per share scale? Or just given the immense resource that might be in front of you would that be something that would be off the table right now? 
John Christmann: No. I would just say that number one we typically as a rule don't comment on rumors and with the -- as we think about portfolio and changes, we typically talk about them after we've done things right? So if you look at us today, we've always believed in a portfolio. We've believed in diversity. We think we've got strong international assets. We maintained those at a time when there was push to try to move to more of a pure-play model. And so we've always maintained the balance. We believe in having an exposure to all the commodities and multiple strong legs to the stool that keeps it strong so. 
David Deckelbaum: Appreciate that. And then just the last one for me is you talked about priorities in accelerating appraisal and potentially development particularly in Block 58. How do you feel now? Or how are you thinking now about exploring in some of the other blocks namely 53? And if there were some leases that opened up towards the end of the year in more of that southern extension in the basin? Would we expect Apache to be present in those? 
John Christmann: Yes. I mean when you look at 58, it's a lot to say grace over for us. We're obviously -- it was important to us to structure our joint venture where we could maintain 50% of the profit oil. We're thrilled to have Block 53. I think directionally the way things are moving it bodes well for 53. So at this point we've got quite a bit to say grace over in that part of the world but. 
David Deckelbaum: Thank you, guys. Congrats.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy. 
David Heikkinen: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. And congratulations on the success in Suriname, kind of triggered some memories of many DSTs that look for perm really poor pressure and then boundaries. With that thickness can you talk about how many DSTs you're running? What are you thinking about as far as detecting boundaries? And are there any analogies that in other basins or the Gulf of Mexico that you could point us to the -- to think about what those results will be as they come in? 
Dave Pursell: Yes Dave. This is Dave Pursell. Good -- thanks for the question. Yes when I think about a mini DST the -- probably the most important piece of information because there's a mini DST is the composite flow capacity. So we're getting that aggregate kind of near wellbore perm across a thicker interval. The deeper reservoir investigation is an added benefit but we still -- you're still not getting out as far as you would in a true conventional drill stem test. So what this is going to -- and the number of tests we're going to perform is dependent on a lot of factors on thickness and a number of things. But what the results are really going to allow us to do is, be able to be more thoughtful in the appraisal program as we come in and design more traditional drill stem test. And so it's a really good piece of information that's going to again make us smarter during an appraisal. 
David Heikkinen:   Yes. So really near wellbore probably won't get enough distance to see any boundaries. And that's really setting up for your future DSTs not anything more than that... 
Dave Pursell: Yes for -- yes that's probably the -- that's the way to characterize it. 
David Heikkinen: That’s helpful. Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotia Bank. 
Paul Cheng: Hi, thank you, good morning. Two quick questions. One in certain the discovery seems to be closing up you should be able to extend the horizontal well and tie it back into one production pop? Is that what you intend to do or that the reserve is it seems like big enough that you may any way that you use maybe two FPSO to develop it? 
John Christmann: Yes. Paul it's just early. I mean clearly the benefit of having these fairways and things is you're going to have all sorts of options. The key is having resource, oil and as you work through that and that's some of the stuff that will go into the planning of how we appraise and ultimately make those decisions. But there's a lot of optionality to how you do it. 
Paul Cheng: And -- okay. And last question that you sort of answered it before, but let me try another way to ask. In Permian if we're looking at -- given the success in Suriname you will be extremely busy in the second half of this decade and probably have very good growth. And so when we're looking at something like in your Permian asset do you consider it still a long-term core portfolio? Or that is not really considered as a long-term core portfolio from what you can see today? 
John Christmann:   No. I mean we like our assets in the Permian. I think we've always believed it was a key pillar. I think what -- in this price environment today, we've just got places that are going to get capital before that's going to get it. And I'll just -- I'll leave it at that. 
Paul Cheng: Thanks.
Operator:   Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. 
Jeffrey Campbell: Good morning and congratulations. I'll jump in on the Suriname success so congratulations. Real quick question there, I just wanted to confirm who will operate the upcoming fourth exploration well? 
John Christmann:   Apache will operate the Keskesi well. After that well is when we've already started transitioning with our partner Total. And I will say, we chose the right partner for a lot of reasons and we're excited to continue working with them and let them take the reins as operator. 
Jeffrey Campbell: Right. Well being a little superstitious. I wouldn't mind seeing you guys drill one more well. So I'm glad to hear that. The other quick question was just how many Permian DUCs do you actually have right now in the queue? 
John Christmann: Permian DUCs you got that. 
Dave Pursell: Yes it's about 50 outside of Alpine High. 
Jeffrey Campbell: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to John for any closing remarks. 
John Christmann: Thank you, operator. And thank you to everyone that has dialed in today. To close the call I'd like to leave you with three key takeaways: first, Apache has responded quickly and aggressively to the volatile price environment thus far in 2020 we are exceeding our cost and capital reduction goals and we'll continue to relentlessly work these initiatives. Second, we are laser-focused on free cash flow generation debt reduction and investing for long-term returns not production growth; and lastly, we have a differentiated portfolio that offers attractive investment options in this volatile oil price environment. The long-term future of that portfolio is underpinned by Suriname where our success rate thus far indicates a very large high-quality oil resource. We look forward to sharing our progress as we continue to appraise our discoveries and explore for additional oil. And with that we will conclude the call. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-07 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Apache Corporation’s First Quarter 2020 Earnings Announcement Webcast. At this time, all participants’ lines are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Gary Clark: Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation’s First Quarter Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by; CEO and President, John Christmann; Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO will then summarize our first quarter financial performance; Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development, Planning, Reserves and Fundamentals will also be available on the call to answer questions. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 15 minutes in lengths with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday’s press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our first quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today’s call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally, I’d like to remind everyone that today’s discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us. As we review our first quarter results today, many Apache employees around the world are continuing to work remotely as part of our COVID-19 response. I would like to wish all of them and those of you, who are doing the same good health as we worked through a very trying time. I also want to acknowledge and thank the Apache team for their dedication and hard work in the face of a very challenging economic and operational environment. They are successfully and safely delivering day-to-day business activities in the face of a sudden and unprecedented change to life as we knew it. My heartfelt appreciation goes out to every one of our great Apache employees and contractors as well as our partners and stakeholders. The global economy and the energy industry have been deeply impacted by COVID-19. as we navigate this crisis, Apache’s primary priorities are keeping the health and safety of our employees and the communities, in which we operate paramount in our decision-making and preserving the inherent value and optionality of our diverse asset base for the long-term. Thus far, our efforts have been successful, and we’re very fortunate to have seen only a few isolated COVID-19 cases throughout the organization. We acted quickly to close offices and implement work from home processes as well as stringent operational protocols in the field. We also have in place contingency plans to ensure continuity in the event Apache incurs a more widespread or sustained impact. In the rest of my prepared remarks, I will discuss the primary actions we are taking to preserve the value of our assets and protect our balance sheet. Summarize our long-term objectives, which have not changed, and lastly, comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2020. While the current crisis is much more severe and complex, some key lessons learned from the 2014 oil price collapse are informing the decisions we are making today. In late February, we communicated our initial 2020 budget at an assumed WTI oil price of $50 per barrel. This seemed appropriate given prevailing supply and demand fundamentals and strip pricing at the time. In early March, OPEC+ failed to reach consensus on supply cuts and it became apparent that COVID-19 would cause an unprecedented amount of demand destruction. Apache responded to the old price drop associated with these events quickly and decisively. On March 12, we announced a plan to reduce activity in Egypt and the North Sea and to eliminate all U.S. drilling and completion activity. This resulted in a $650 million decrease in our 2020 upstream capital budget, which is now down nearly 55% from 2019. We also announced a 90% reduction to our dividend that’s preserving $340 million of cash flow on an annualized basis and strengthening our liquidity. To protect cash flow from further downside price dislocation, we entered into substantial oil hedge positions primarily for the second and third quarters, which we believe have the most volatility risk. We implemented deeper cost cutting measures announcing on April 1, an increase in our estimated annualized cost savings to $300 million, up from $150 million a month earlier. Apache benefited from the significant progress already made on our organizational redesign, which commenced in the third quarter of 2019. This enabled us to make the incremental cost reduction decisions confidently without compromising safety, asset integrity or our ability to resume activity when warranted. Finally, we have conducted a thorough price sensitivity analysis and operational evaluation of oil producing wells across the company, which is now informing the methodical and integrated approach we are taking to rolling production shut-ins and curtailments. This process will enable us to preserve cash flow in this distressed and vulnerable price environment and protect our assets. All of these actions were carefully planned and none were taken lightly. While very difficult, they were necessary to preserve liquidity and ensure ample runway to return to a more sustainable and profitable price environment. Next, I would like to reiterate our longer-term objectives, which still hold true despite some of the short-term impacts of the current situation. First, Apache will budget conservatively, aggressively manage our cost structure to ensure free cash flow generation and prioritize debt reduction to strengthen our balance sheet. We will maintain a balanced and diversified portfolio, and continue to invest for long-term returns rather than production growth. In the Permian, we will continue building economic inventory and maintain optionality, and in Egypt and the North Sea, we will flex activity to preserve free cash flow generation. Lastly, we will continue to enhance our portfolio through exploration. Our recent success, offshore Suriname is a prime example of this strategy and Block 58 remains a clear priority for Apache. As we look to the remainder of 2020, there are a number of fundamental uncertainties. The most important of these is the timing and magnitude of a recovery in demand for oil is supply response alone cannot solve this problem in the short-term. For Apache, the best course of action is to aggressively reduce our cost structure, protect our balance sheet, and manage operations to preserve cash flow. Our diversified global portfolio gives us the ability to optimize capital allocations as market conditions change. Just as we did following the oil price crash in 2014, we have left intact a higher proportion of international capital investment, which offers better returns than the U.S. in a lower price environment. To wrap up, Apache is taking the necessary steps to manage cash flow and protect our balance sheet. We have ample liquidity and a long runway to carry us through to a better price environment, and will maintain the flexibility and capacity to increase activity in a thoughtful manner as conditions warrant. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on our first quarter in 2020 outlook.
Steve Riney: Thank you, John. My remarks this morning will provide a few more details on first quarter 2020 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. I will also comment on the strength of Apache’s liquidity position, which is more than sufficient to bridge this significant and potentially prolonged downturn. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported a first quarter 2020 consolidated net loss of $4.5 billion or $11.86 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which are non-cash impairments totaling $4.5 billion. Impairments were driven primarily by the impact of weak oil prices on the carrying value of our proved properties. Most of these impairments were in legacy vertical developments in the Permian basin, excluding these and other smaller items adjusted earnings for the quarter were a loss of $51 million or $0.13 per share. G&A expense in the quarter was $68 million, which was considerably below our guidance of $120 million. Some of our stock award programs are cash settled and each quarter accounting rules require us to mark-to-market the accrued liability for these awards based on changes in our share price. Typically, this has not been material, but it resulted in more than a $30 million reduction in G&A expense for the first quarter due to the significant drop in the share price during the quarter. Capital investment and operating costs in first quarter were also below guidance, as a result of the spending reduction efforts we have instituted as. As with G&A costs, there will be more significant impacts in future quarters. Apache’s adjusted production for the quarter was below our most recent guidance; reported gas production in the Permian basin was materially impacted by commercial arrangements at some gas processing plants, where the operator takes volume in kind as reimbursement for power costs. In lower gas environments like in the first quarter, the impact on reported volumes can be significant; in this case, approximately 24 million cubic feet per day. Permian oil volumes were also below guidance caused by the rapid reduction in activity due to the oil price downturn. As we look to the remainder of 2020, our full-year upstream capital investment program will be around $1.1 billion, approximately 60% of which will be in our international businesses. For the second quarter, upstream capital investment will be approximately $230 million, a sharp reduction from the first quarter. With respect to other typical guidance items, there are many uncertainties on a forward-looking basis. As such, we are not providing second quarter guidance and we are removing the full-year 2020 guidance, which we provided in February. In terms of production volumes, we are in the process of implementing a shut-in and curtailment program, which is already impacting second quarter volumes. The size and duration of this program will depend on many factors and is therefore difficult to forecast at this time. In closing, I would like to touch on our substantial liquidity position, our efforts to protect that position and how we will put it to use. When this downturn began, we quickly implemented actions to match spending reductions with the deteriorating oil price environment. As a result of those actions, Apache can achieve free cash flow neutrality for all of 2020 at an average WTI oil price in the low-30s. The original plan for 2020 required a WTI oil price closer to $50. Our goal is to achieve cash flow neutrality in order to minimize drawing on liquidity to fund our day-to-day operations. We entered this downturn with a tremendous liquidity backstop. We have a $4 billion revolving credit facility, which matures in March 2024 with a one-year extension option. Following our credit downgrade by S&P, we posted letters of credit for North Sea abandonment obligations utilizing a sublimit in the credit facilities specifically established for such purposes. This currently reduces the availability on the credit facility by $800 million. In terms of debt, one of our key financial goals for the year was to generate free cash flow to reduce leverage through debt repurchases. This remains a longer-term priority that is more challenging for the near-term given the price environment. Over the last two years, we eliminated $1.6 billion of debt in the near-term maturity window through paydown and refinancing efforts, leaving only $937 million of bond maturities over the next three years. Absent refinancing or retaining free cash flow to retire these bonds, we’ll use the revolver to pay them down. Conservatively, assuming all three years of debt maturities go on the revolver, we would still have $2.3 billion of remaining liquidity to manage through this downturn. In summary, we have taken significant and decisive actions to preserve liquidity, protect the balance sheet, and retain asset value for the future. These recent steps combined with those of the last few years give us sufficient capacity to bridge to a more sustainable and profitable price environment. And with that, I will turn the call back to John for some closing remarks.
John Christmann: Before we go to Q&A, I’d like to make a few comments regarding the durability of our production base in a reduced spending environment. As planned 2020 capital investment levels, our adjusted international production should be roughly sustainable from 2019 to 2020 on an exit rate basis. Assuming no material curtailments were shut-ins. In the Permian, where we have eliminated activity for the remainder of the year, the unknown magnitude, timing and duration of our curtailment and shut-in program makes it premature to provide a high confidence near-term outlook. I would note, however, approximately one-third of our Permian oil production comes from legacy vertical wells that have a base decline rate of around 10%, hits are over all Permian oil decline rate is significantly [Technical Difficulty] basin average. As we look ahead to 2021, our Permian decline rates will moderate and the capital investment required to sustain year-over-year production volumes will fall significantly. We will provide more details around future production as price volatility recedes and we have more visibility. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
Bob Brackett: Hi, good morning, guys. I appreciate that you can’t talk in great specificity around the trajectory for Permian production, but can you kind of frame it in terms of what it could look like if you split out the legacy vertical versus kind of the shale? I mean just very wide goalposts as it were.
John Christmann: I mean, Bob, hope things are going well. I’d say in general, we’ve got two pieces there, and our conventional is a third of our oil production in the Permian. And as I said there at the end, it’s got kind of a 10% decline rate. The other two-thirds is unconventional, and I will say that we have been running a pretty flat pace. If anything, we moderated our activity pace in 2019. It was down from 2018. So, we’re going to be at a little lower unconventional decline rate, just because of the pace relative to our percentage as compared to most. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color on that.
Bob Brackett: And on that legacy vertical, are there any – what’s the inventory of wells that have just gotten to the point, where they’re not economic in sort of a two to three year recovery window? When would you abandon those? Or do you just not have that many in the portfolio?
John Christmann: Yes, I think, and I’m going to let Dave talk a few minutes on the process we’ve gone through on the shut-ins, because it’s something I’m – we’ve really put some time and effort into. But I think the important thing to know is, is that we’ve taken a very, very methodical approach. I think we’ve shut-in around 2,500 wells produce an average of about three barrels a day and about 150 barrels of water a day. We’ve done this in a way that we can kind of roll the wells and preserve the asset integrity. So, we feel pretty good about being able to bring those back, cost structures coming down. But we’re going to manage near-term for free cash flow and we think shut-in as long as it makes sense, but they wanted to give some color and climb maybe on the shut-in process that we’ve gone through.
Dave Pursell: Sure. Thanks, John and Bob, thanks for the question. And Clay, will jump in here in a second. But as John said, it’s a pretty robust process and it involves operations. It involves our production and reservoir engineers, our land team to understand the lease obligations, marketing to understand existing contracts and then our planning group and asset teams to really stress some of the economic parameters on the wells. John gave you some numbers on wells that are currently shut-in. We would anticipate as we go through May and into June those numbers likely increase, but you can see the kind of wells that were shutting in. There’s another bucket of wells is that when they break we’re opting not to fix them, and we’ve dropped our work over rig count by 80% since the beginning of the year and really tightened up the economic criteria in this market for those to justify working those wells over. And so the bucket that John talked about, most of those wells are wells that were overtly shut-in, but some of those are wells that we’ve opted not to repair. I think when you think about it, would any of these wells be permanently shut-in that that’s a function of longer-term price, but because we have a methodical process, because we have a reservoir production facility engineers involved in the process. We’re shutting these wells in, with the anticipation that they’ll ultimately be brought back online. So, we’re doing the right kind of chemical treatments before we shut them in and Clay can talk about that in a second. Some of the other considerations when you’re thinking about the economics here, wells that produce a little more gas than others, like to get a benefit in today’s gas market. And then when we think about our Permian exposure, we have some marketing agreements where a meaningful percentage of our Permian production goes to Corpus on the Epic pipe and are exposed to Brent link pricing. So, we have a number of considerations there. And finally from me, the other thing that we’re doing our subsurface teams of engineers and geologists have taken this opportunity to do some interference testing and some of our unconventional plays as we’re defining some production, we found historically that interference testing is one of the best ways to really understand well spacing and well placement in these three dimensional and conventional plays. We’re doing some of that starting imminently and again, we feel very confident that when things get better, we’re going to come out of this, a whole lot smarter than we were going into it. I had probably longer answered than you wanted, but I’m going pass it over to Clay to add some color.
Clay Bretches: Yes. sure, Dave. This is Clay Bretches and let me pile on a little bit with what Dave was saying and actually, add some color. Dave was talking about the shut-in wells and the reduction in work over activity and that is all true and that’s all something that, it was temporary until we bring those wells back on. In the meantime, while we do that, we have to make sure that we focus on preservation and so we make sure that we preserve and pickle the wells to reduce as much corrosion as possible. We also have to preserve the surface facilities and make sure that our tanks are preserved properly or rotating equipment is preserved so that when we do come back and flip that switch and it’s time to produce again, all of that production can come back on. And one of the things that we talked about, and John has alluded to this many times, a lot times in shut-in wells, especially for a long period of time, you have a lot of surprises when you turn them back on. Some of them are good and some of them are bad. The bad side and what can happen is you can end up with a lot of corrosion if you have not done everything in your power to make sure that you preserve those when you set them in. So, we’re taking great pains to make sure that preservation is going correctly. The next I wanted to talk about is cost structure. And in the opening remarks, John mentioned that we’re looking at a $300 million reduction, which is up two-fold from the $150 million that we had now announced a month earlier. And so I want to give some color on that, because most of this is permanent cost reduction and a change of the cost structure. You heard Steve talk about how we could operate as we go forward from what, prior to this great reduction in oil prices, it was a $50 oil world. We can go now to a $30 per barrel oil world. And so a lot of this has to do with the initiatives that we were already engaged in, about $150 million worth, which was announced after the end of the year. $150 million was largely G&A associated with our headquarters functions and with our various technical functions, in our offices, in our Houston, and Cairo and Aberdeen, Midland offices. But with the reduction in oil price, we had to take a lot of action to find other permanent cost reductions, and we did. So, what we see now are these permanent cost reductions, a lot of that has to do with field employee reductions, contractor reductions in the field, a lot of supply chain initiatives. Our supply chain group has been doing a great deal of work in order to get new contracts. And these contracts are more long lived than what we believe to be, hey, this temporary reduction in prices. And so we’ve been able to get some really good contracts, renegotiate those contracts and take advantage of the price environment that we’re in right now. And then the last thing I would mention, and I think this is really, really important, because this is a bottoms-up approach, but we went to our offshore installation managers, we went to our area operations managers in the field and the onshore, and we asked them for their initiatives, and how they could reduce costs? And how they can reduce costs in a meaningful way. And it was a very thoughtful process and a lot of work has been done to identify areas, where we can reduce costs, whether it means reducing redundant activities, reducing field offices automating processes that heretofore were more manual in nature. Those are the actions that we’re taking, and it’s led to this significant increase in these permanent cost reductions that we’re now pushing up to $300 million plus. So, I’ll turn it back over to John.
John Christmann: I appreciate that long thorough response. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your line is open.
Charles Meade: Good morning, John to you and your whole team there.
John Christmann: Good morning, Charles.
Charles Meade: Yes. I appreciate that you guys probably aren’t – won’t, don’t want to speak about this. And don’t laugh at my pronunciation of the Kwaskwasi. I think that the one that’s currently drilling, but I wondered if you could – if there’s anything that you could – that you could offer about maybe, what you guys have continued to learn from your first two discoveries there offshore, Suriname, Maka and Sapakara West as you continue to analyze the – whether it be the course or the fluid samples or whatever else you might care to share.
John Christmann: Charles, thanks for the question. We remain very excited about turn-on. I think most importantly now that we’re two for two on both Maka and Sapakara from the wells, and actually, two for two in both the Campanian and the Santonian formations. We’ve proven, we’ve got an active hydrocarbon system. It’s the oil, with some gas condensate in some of the shower, campaigning zones in both Sapakara and Maka. But we’re very excited. You look at the distance between the wells are separate features. We’re now drilling Kwaskwasi is, you mentioned it is another separate feature. It’s actually in between the two. And then we will be moving back to Kwaskwasi for the fourth well, which is on the other side of Sapakara. So, I think it just shows, there’s not just one feature out there, we’ve got 1.44 million acres, the block is highly prospective. We’re only in two of water now, eight play types when things were going very well. So, we’re excited about, what’s in front of us. We’re currently working the plans with our partner, total on the appraisal program for Maka. We’re due to submit that to the government of Suriname later this month, which we will do. So, we’re anxious to kind of push forward there. We’re also working on the plans at Sapakara and it’ll fall sometime later this summer. So, we’re very encouraged. Things remain kind of on track and it was turning out to be everything that we hoped it could be. So, a very strong petroleum hydrocarbon system has got a long charge, that’s got locked charged.
Charles Meade: Got it. Thanks. Thanks for all that detail, John. And then going back to your prepared comments, you guys just gave a really lengthy and detailed answer about these the shut-ins, but I just want to clarify something. When you talked about the rolling curtailments in your prepared comments, was that specific just to these 2,500 vertical Permian wells or is that also happening in other parts of your portfolio, whether it be horizontal Permian or international?
John Christmann: I mean, I think today Charles, we have around 2,500 wells shut-in all of the fields are going to be handled in a rolling way, and/or they’re going to be pickled and done very methodically. So, we’re working through that based on what we think is the best way to operate those. And so it’s a very methodical approach. As Dave mentioned, one of the things we’re also doing is, we’ve really thought through what data we can collect and how we can do it. I mean, you don’t have the luxury when you’re running a program sometimes of taking the time and doing the interference tests and the things that really help you understand spacing, and pattern alignment and so forth on the unconventional side. So, as Dave mentioned that as we get into June, the numbers going to grow a little bit. But a lot of the may stuff’s kind of already cast, but we’re taking a very bottoms-up, a very detailed approach and it will be designed to protect the wells and also learn as much as we can, because I think that’ll help drive our capital efficiency when we do kind of get back to work.
Charles Meade: Thank you, John.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Doug Leggate: Excuse me. Thank you. Good morning everybody. Hope everyone’s doing well out there. John I got a couple of follow-ups I guess to – maybe I’ll kick off with Suriname. Your – my understanding is, you’ve got 120 days from when you disclose the discovery to the governments that I would preview actually by right around now. So, I’m interested to know are we really end of the month, are we eminent? And can you give us some scope as to what you’re looking to do in the appraisal plan in terms of drilling or further interpretation of seismic or whatever that might look like?
John Christmann: Yes. actually, we’ve got the – the obligations are, we have 24 hours to make a discovery notice. And then we have 30 days to submit the official discovery report and then that clock starts. So, we actually are going to be the end of this month, Doug, when we – when we do submit the first plant. So, there’s actually the 30-day window between discovery and the official discovery notice is probably the 30-days that you’re missing in there. Yes, our partner and us are both continuing to do lots of things. As you know, with now two penetrations down on the seismic, there’s a lot of work we’re doing, which I think will be informative, a lot of reprocessing and things and will continue to do throughout the process. And really that some of the work we’re putting into the appraisal program is, how we design it to gain as much information as we need to make the proper decision. So, we’ll be in a position to submit something later this month to the government. And then they’ve got a 30-day period of respond back to us. So, it’s all systems go.
Doug Leggate: Well, thank you for closing the gap for me. The 30 days I wasn’t deed missing, but I guess if I could just try to, a little bit on this overview, at least is that you’re sitting on the depositional center here. Can you at least give us some idea of what the feature looks like relative to what we’ve seen next door? Because, I think there’s still some debate as to whether, there’s a viable development here. Is there anything, any color you can offer in that? Now, get on to the…
John Christmann: Yes. I would just say that the features are very large as always said. That’s why we’re working on the appraisal plans on how we want to appraise them. But the nice thing is they’re large and you’ve got obviously stacked pays, both that we’ve already discovered thus far in both the Campanian and the Santonian. So, it’s not disappointing in any way on that front and we’re excited about it.
Doug Leggate: My last one, if I may, is just changing geographies completely to Egypt. And one of the things that I guess continues to not get a lot of attention is the extraordinary expiration success rate you’re having there, 94%. I guess this last – last quarter run. Can you just walk us through what the go forward plan is in this lower oil price environment? And it may actually be a question for Steve, because I’m really interested to know how the PSC allows you to hold up your volumes in this very low oil price environment in the context of cost recovery barrel, legacy cost recovery entitlements that you have. So, any kind of column in the go-forward plan on the volume support you can get to the PSC would be helpful. Thanks.
John Christmann: Well, Doug thanks for noticing Egypt. Yes, we’re – you’re look at that program, I think what you’re saying is the early fruit from the acreage we picked up, the seismic we shot; we spent the last several years. In fact, we’re still shooting a very, very large acreage. We reshot a lot of our old existing seismic, the price – the previous shoot was done I think in 2013. So, a lot to change on that front and you’re seeing the fruits with some of the discoveries that we’ve announced this year, or we have infrastructure and tie in. We have some very, very impactful targets yet to drill that we’re excited about this year on the exploration front. And so what you’re saying is we’ve migrated the capital, we’ve ratcheted back a little bit in Egypt. It’s the area we’ve ratcheted back the least though, as we said on the international side. It’s also an area that we’ll want to put capital in, kind of first as you start to put capital back, because we’ve – just it’s what you’ve got is you’ve got six million acres, you’ve got multiple basins and the difference between it and an area like the Permian, you’ve got as much stack pay, but you’ve got conventional rock. And so that’s what differentiates it. The second thing I’ll say, and Steve may want to add some color, but these PSCs were designed and created in a much, much lower price environment. And so the way they work, things work very well in the price environment we’re at today. And so that’s how and that’s why Egypt continues to be an area that we can lean on. And that’s really one of the advantages to having an international portfolio. You’ve got rent, pricing, you’ve got the PSC structure and it’s not just the loan, unconventional treadmill that you have in the Permian. So, anything Steve, you want to add on the PSC?
Steve Riney: Yes, I just, Doug, what I did is, I maybe point it to the supplement. We’ve got a page in there on the Egypt volumes that breaks it out pretty clearly. And what you’ll see is when you compare gross production volume to the net production volume that goes to the concession holders, us and Sinopec, we’ll find them. The vast majority of the barrels actually still go to Egypt, which is the way it ought to be when you’ve got a drilling program as John was talking about, that is just highly economic when you can – we can drill for the cost of these vertical wells and you get the types of oil rates that you can get out of Egypt. So, Egypt does end up with the vast majority of the volume, but what that does allow is that when you’re in a very low oil price environment, like today. We do get first call on cost recovery barrels. And so those barrels – some of the barrels moved from Egypt over to the concession holders in order to get cost recovery and cost recovery, it will vary. We’ve got 25, 26 some odd concessions there, different PSC contracts and all of them are slightly different from each other, but they’re pretty similar. And the way cost recovery works is during the period, which is a quarter – you will get full recovery through oil volumes or gas volumes for all of your in-period expense costs. And then you also get a quarterly share of amortization or depreciation if you will on historic capital. And the PSEs do vary slightly, but most of them are either a four-year or a five-year amortization of the capital spend. So, every quarter you do have a pretty significant hedging benefit from the PSC effect if you will, a built-in hedge. And so that’s why you see our adjusted barrels went up in the first quarter from fourth quarter, because of the price roll. you’ll see that again, most likely in second quarter from first.
Doug Leggate: That’s what I was getting at, Steve. could you put some order of magnitude on the bump given that oil price? can you give some order of magnitude to the bump given the oil price?
John Christmann: No. We’re not going to give that at this point in time. I think you could probably do a rough calculation of from fourth quarter to first quarter with your assumptions on what prices will be in the second quarter.
Doug Leggate: It seems that there’s a pretty big number. That’s why I was trying to get it from you. But guys, thanks so much…
John Christmann: So, very nice benefit of the PSC structure, it does, in a high oil price environment, it cuts the other way. Obviously it’s a double edged sword, but in the low oil price environment, it does provide a very nice natural hedge.
Doug Leggate: Got it. Thanks, guys.
John Christmann: Thanks, Doug.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson from Stephens. Your line is open.
Gail Nicholson: Good morning. I’m looking at the other permanent cost reduction that you guys discussed earlier in the call. Can you just talk about what the split between those is U.S. versus international and then the savings that achieved to date in the permanent cost reductions; have they been more skewed to one region than the other?
John Christmann: I’ll start out, Gail. A lot of those, we started – I mean we were fortunate in that we started kind of an operational redesign last September. So, we were six to seven months into a total revamping of our operating model, where we were closing some offices and really centralizing a lot of functions. What this enabled us to do in mid-March was just take a much, much deeper cut. And so a lot of those cost savings are going to be G&A related. They’re kind of across the board, a lot of it even on the corporate side. So, a big chunk of that is geared towards the overhead side and the G&A side. Secondly, the cost saving efforts have been kind of across the board, and I can let Clay give a little bit of an idea on the operational split, but you’ve got a lot in the Permian is we’re probably the lion’s share of that is, and then other things we’re doing in the North Sea and Egypt. I’ll say one thing with some of the COVID protocol that we put in place; we’re doing a lot more screening. We’ve kind of reduced down to critical folks that we need on the platform. So we’re actually adding some things in some areas too is, we’ve gone to a very specific approach, but any color Clay, you want to give on the splits.
Clay Bretches: now, I think you nailed it, John, as far as the order and where we’re seeing the biggest cost savings is U.S. being the largest, we saw a significant savings with the permanent closure of the San Antonio office and a lot of the reduction in expenses that we had in the NAUR region. But we also have seen a lot of reduction in expenses in the Permian basin excluding in NAUR. So, we’re seeing good reductions there. Same thing in the North Sea, we’ve had some reductions there as far as both headcount and contractor headcount that’s been substantial and ongoing. And then in Egypt, we’re really starting to pull the covers back on Egypt and understand that better. So, we think that there’s some low hanging fruit there that we can go after and attack. So, we’re not through cutting cost at this point. We think that there’s – there are other cost initiatives that that we can gain from and we’re working on that right now.
Gail Nicholson: Right. And then…
Steve Riney: Gail, it’s Steve, if I can give it a little bit more color on that as well. We talk about $300 million of identified sustainable cost reductions so far and that’s both in G&A and OpEx. And as John said, we had started the G&A focus last year. And so we’re ahead of the OpEx side. The OpEx started really in earnest with the oil price downturn. On the G&A side, G&A reductions so far are more than two thirds of the $300 million identified. G&A will include costs in the corporate center obviously, but also G&A related costs in the regions, and not to confuse things too much, but the G&A goes to three different buckets on our financial reports. A portion of it will show up in G&A expense on the P&L. Some of it shows up in LOE, because it’s allocated that way. And then some of it will go to the capital program. So, it’ll show up in capEx, but it’s all dollars of reductions and spends, regardless of where, where it goes. And then in addition to the sustainable reductions, which as I said, are approaching about $300 million identified. There will be some costs that we’ve identified and began the process of just deferring things that can just wait until a later point in time.
Gail Nicholson: Great. Thank you for that incremental clarity. And then looking at the – in the quarter, you guys made a solid profit on purchased oil and gas. How should we think about this going forward?
John Christmann: Yes. so, this is the first quarter, where we have separated out the purchase – the sale of purchase oil and gas and the purchase costs of purchased oil and gas. And the reason for that is because this is the first time that it’s become material to our P&L and it’s become the cause of the pipeline – the long haul pipeline transport contracts that we’ve entered into. And this just gets down to the basics of how we run the business. We – the product that we produce, we sell in basin just as a general role. We sell all of the hydrocarbons in basin. We have a marketing organization, who amongst the many other things that they do. One of the things they do is they help us keep basin pricing connected to the larger broader market and we obviously had some events over the last few years that were disconnecting the Waha and El Paso Permian pricing from NYMEX Henry Hub, Houston Ship Channel type of pricing. And so the marketing organization recommended and we took them up on it of helping pipelines like GCX and PHP go from concept to FID and to reality with GCX now. So, we actually entered into contracts on those pipes and then we helped them get them get across the line. Of course, we also took an equity option, which Altus Midstream owns now in those pipelines, but getting those contracts – getting those contracts in place helped to help the pipelines get built. And in the marketing organization now manages are exposure to those transport contracts and what you see is the on our P&L now is the effects of the marketing organization purchasing product in basin or along the pipelines. It’s not necessarily at Waha or El Paso Permian, it could be anywhere along the pipeline or where they have access to the pipeline and then selling it at the other end of the pipeline or in other offloaded locations along that pipeline. And so they basically manage that exposure through purchasing and selling product. And since it is becoming material now, we need to separate that out and you see that the marketing organization made $22 million in the first quarter on that primarily, because of the differential promotion of the quarter between Waha and Houston Ship Channel.
Gail Nicholson: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Scialla from Stifel. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning and thank you for taking my call.
John Christmann: Good morning.
Unidentified Analyst: This is actually [indiscernible] in for Mike. My question is a follow-up of a previous question on that 24 million cubic feet per day impact from a processing contract, and maybe, you could provide additional color into what am I look like going forward?
John Christmann: Yes. So, the most important thing to understand on that is that it has – it has no economic impact. So, we’ve got a contract, where we have to have gas processed to make it – to get it to pipeline spec. And we have a contract with a third party and then the third party charges us a fee plus power costs. And this is very typical of these types of arrangements, because power can be pretty variable costs. And in order to not take the risk of fluctuations and volatility and power costs, I just pass it on as a means of pricing the contract. And so what this – what this gas processor does with us and it did with many other parties too. Because like I said, this is a very typical term in these types of contracts. they take in kind portion of the gas that flows through the plant. And then they effectively take the revenue from that gas as payment of the power costs, and because of accounting rules, we can’t report that as produced volume, because it doesn’t belong to us. It effectively belongs to someone else. And so that’s the only reason why it’s just a – if we didn’t have this contract, this term, in this contract, we would report more volume, report more revenue, but then we would have an equal amount of more processing costs on the P&L, it has a zero financial impact.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. So, it is expected to continue about the same amount going forward?
John Christmann: It’ll – it fluctuates with gas pricing. And so it’ll – if you can predict gas prices, then you’d be able to predict the volumes. It’s because gas prices got so low this quarter that the volume went so high. This will – this may, it occurred last year also in the Permian area and it certainly will occur in the future most likely, but it’s something, it’s not a norm.
Operator: Thank you. We’re going to take our next question from Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeanine Wai: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. My first question is on activity and maybe, trigger points for pricing, the operating cash margin in the U.S. continues to lag the North sea and just pretty, pretty meaningfully. And I know the U.S. is kind of a mixed bag of operating subareas. but at what oil price would you consider reactivating activity in the Permian? And we’re just asking because – the trigger price might be a little different for you than others given Apache’s strong international portfolio and maybe, wanting to maximize cash flow, because you’ve got to continue to fund Suriname and then you’ve also got the debt maturities coming due.
John Christmann: Jeanine, you actually answered your own question, but we will, I mean, if you think about our priorities of first thing I’ll say is, we will be slower to go back to work when we were shutting things down and we’re going to be very methodical with it. our priorities are going to be one, debt; two, would be dividend. As you start to think about capital, we’re going to continue to maintain the exploration and the appraisal program, and Suriname, Egypt would sit next and then you kind of get into the ducts in the Permian, North sea. And then we’d start thinking about the rig lines in Permian. the nice thing about our unconventional acreage is most of it, we don’t have any lease obligations. It’s not going anywhere. We’re not losing anything in that option. So, it’s all just a function of timing. And I think for us, we want to be very methodical. If you look back to how we kind of went back to work post the 2015, 2016 shutdown. And we’ve kind of been through this drill before as we went from 93 rigs before by second quarter of 2016 at that time period. We started the latter part of 2017 ratcheting back up and went to an eight-rig program and on the unconventional Permian side and we’ve been scaling back a little bit. So, I think we’d want to see higher longer deck and definitely, the advantages we have is the portfolio and we’re going to be managing cash flow. That’s it.
Jeanine Wai: Okay. Well, really appreciate the detailed responses. That’s very helpful. My second question and the follow-up is regarding the debt maturities and adjusting those over the next three years. Do you have an estimate of what price oil needs to average in order to pay those off strictly out of free cash flow? And maybe, we’re just getting a little 2Q here. I know it depends on a ton of different factors that may not be known today. So maybe, an impossible question, but any commentary you might have around the free cash flow trajectory for Apache would be helpful. I know that you can pay the maturities in the revolver and you can fall back on that, but that might not be ideal.
John Christmann: Yes, Jeanine. Yes. We’re not going to give a lot of guidance or insights into free cash flow in the out years. All I’d say is in 2020, we are – we’re basically running free cash flow neutral with the current capital program. If you were running that at about $30 WTI, and so if you take the dividend, the reduction, the capital spending we’re on right now, the pace of capital spending we’re on right now, the cost reductions, the $300 million of cost reductions. and we’re at about a cash flow neutral WTI price of about $30. John indicated that reducing debt is certainly one of our highest priorities for future free cash flows. We’ve indicated in the past that our sensitivity to a dollar movement in oil prices is somewhere in the $50 million to $60 million range. So, you could probably use those and now get to a solution point on what the – what it might take to be able to pay down $937 million of debt over the next few years.
Jeanine Wai: Great. That’s actually really helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann from SunTrust. Your line is open.
Neal Dingmann: Good morning. Just another one, you guys talked a little on Egypt and my question is more just on Egypt and North sea, specifically, just wanted, how do you guys think about maintenance caps there? I know that’s, you probably spending more there in Egypt and the maintenance cap, but I’m just wondering, could you talk about how you view that now as those become more efficient and potential free cash flow of each, let’s just use sort of the strip-ish prices?
John Christmann: Neal, when we look at those two areas, we’ve typically needed $700 million to $800 million or so to kind of hold them flat, combined. And those are – that’s net – our net portion of the – for the JV in Egypt for Sinopec. So, when you think about that, we’re slightly under that level this year with the reduction, we’ve shaved a little bit of that back, but as I mentioned, we’ve really high graded the inventory in Egypt and we’re seeing some strong results coming out of there. So that’s going to help us with that number. And then secondly, we’ve got the luxury of some, some really nice tie-ins and the timing of those that came on with our garden too well and so forth. And we’ve curtailed that well a little bit, given price volatility and things there. So, slightly under, but in kind of an improving picture in terms of what it takes to maintain those two areas.
Neal Dingmann: Okay. And then just quickly move over to the permian, you all mentioned the release that you thought you’d have about 70 ducts. I’m just wondering, is there a sort of level that you’re comfortable taking this down to or just to before you’d bring rigs back or just wondering how you think about that count?
John Christmann: No. that number is just the result of where we were in the program and when we kind of picked up the range, I mean we – it was easier to shut down the completion crews. So that’s the first thing we did was shut the crews down. it took a little bit of notice time on the rigs as we mentioned. I think we’re on our last well on the Permian as we speak. And so that was purely just a result of kind of where we were. It’s more than we typically would carry, because of the shutting the completion crews down first, which is going to give us a little bit of ducts to bring on when we decided to put the comeback term. We’ll have about 15 in Alpine High in the restaurant, our Midland basin unconventional and for those are three mile laterals. So, it’ll give us some uplift when it’s time to put some capital back to work.
Neal Dingmann: Great details. Thanks, John.
John Christmann: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Reynolds from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Scott Reynolds: Thanks. Hey, I appreciate all the color and I know you’ve been given a lot of bookends in terms of how to think about Apache here going forward, but just so I’m understanding it, I mean, the goal is you kind of go through 2020 and to 2021 at this point, based on your current activity level, it seems like you’re not spending at maintenance levels, when you talk about that $30 per barrel price sort of resiliency too. And I’m just curious, like, if you brought yourself to more of a maintenance production mode in each of the areas, what does that price indicator look like?
John Christmann: Well, I mean you’ve got the brackets there, Scott, because we were going to grow slightly with, where our budget originally was, which was geared around a $50 WTI. As we’ve said now, we can make kind of cash flow at 30, but we are going to decline, we’re below maintenance levels in the Permian. And so that will come down and international is going to be kind of flat or relatively flat. So, it’s somewhere in between there in terms of if you were going to call it, generate free cash flow and actually keep our volumes flat.
Scott Reynolds: Okay. It’s fair enough. And obviously, in Suriname, you’ve got your – things you’re submitting to the government at this point in time. What can we expect from Apache over the course of this next year in terms of like how we’re going to hear new information and what the plan is leading into potential appraisals that once you get the government response back, you’ll have a press release or can you give us a sense of how you’re going to report the new information to us over the balance of this year?
John Christmann: Well, I mean, that’s something we’ll work through with our JV partner. I mean, typically, we – you submit the appraisal program; it’s kind of a work plan. And then we’ll go execute that. So, we’re not in a position right now with our partner, where we’re announcing what that entails. We’ve got a couple of years to do the appraisal program and before we have to make a decision on FID. And so we want to go about that as quickly as possible, but we’ve kind of balanced, you got to have to balance that as you get into the back half of this year, early next year with when you start.
Scott Reynolds: Does the current oil price environment impact the FID decision at all much?
John Christmann: I mean, right now the good news is, is that you look at Suriname, you look at the timing of it you’re four to five years realistically from discovery to when you’d have production online. I think that all of us would look through to seeing a better price environment. I don’t know what the recovery shapes going to look like more near term, but I think as we would get out the timeframe, where Suriname comes into play and we’ve seen no wavering from our partner and we’re fully committed as well. So, I think it’s something that stays on track and it’s actually something that we can fund and our JV is beneficial to our capital profile spending.
Scott Reynolds: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And in the interest of time, we’re going to take our final question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Brian Singer: Thank you and good morning.
John Christmann: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Singer: Good morning. There’s been a bit of an improvement in expectations for natural gas prices into 2021 and I just wondered what it would take natural gas price wise, if anything to either shift or increase capital and the gas in your parts of the Permian, Alpine high or other areas within the portfolio?
John Christmann: Well, what I’ll say, Brian is it really boils back down to economics and the portfolio, right. So, it just goes to show you a year ago, we were talking about curtailing gas and here we are now curtailing oil in the basin. So, it just shows you how quickly things can change. We like having a portfolio, we like having a commodity mix. It gives us leverage, where we can put capital and have options, whereas if you’re saddled to it being a pure play in one commodity stream, that’s what you’re tied to. So, I’ll just say it’ll – the projects will have to compete as we start to put capital back to work and a lot of hinge on how the products are trading relative and what the view of them longer term is at that time. So right now, your gas, your wells and things have higher are more economic right now than the straight oil wells, which is a total flip from where we are.
Brian Singer: Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up is with regards to a hedging strategy. Apache was unhedged in 2019 and into 2020, and I think there’s maybe a mischaracterizing, but that has been more of a preference to depend on the movement in capital spending versus the pluses or minuses of hedging. There have been some hedges that have been added recently and I just wondered if you can talk more philosophically about how – if there’s been any changes to how we should think about your hedging strategy going forward.
John Christmann: I mean, I think philosophically, no. We came into this on edge. We saw a lot of short-term volatility. And so we really put the hedges in place, swaps Q2, the callers and three and four of the few swaps in Q3, what we put those in is protection. to the downside scenario as you work through, what was a shutdown, but not a philosophical change, unless Steve, if there’s anything you want to add on the hedging.
Steve Riney: Yes, sure, John. I’ll always take the opportunity to talk about our philosophy on hedging. So now, it hasn’t changed, Brian. We believe that the best hedge is the ability to have flexibility in your activity. I think that current price environment proves that. So, we think the best hedge is the ability to ramp down activity, which is what the industry needs to do right now and associated with that to get cost levels down as low as possible. There are times when we do believe, we need to engage in hedging activity. We had one of those in the past when we had commitments that couldn’t be avoided, where we had to build out the midstream at Alpine high. We’ve got one now, where you’ve got a period, where oil prices are getting into a range where cost just can’t be cut low enough to maintain free cash flow. And so that’s why we entered into the hedges as we saw what was happening. We knew second quarter was going to be very, very painful. You could see that coming and that’s why we hedged the vast majority of our volumes for second quarter, mostly with swaps, all with swaps. And then we hedged a little bit less for 3Q and even less still for 4Q. And there has been a combination of swaps and some collars. So we just – we generally just believe that we have a preference to refrain from financial hedging. We, as I spoke about earlier with the Egypt and coming in the future of the Suriname, we do have some natural hedges already in the portfolio and it’s – I’ll just point out that nobody ever asks us why we didn’t hedge after prices run up. I only ask when prices have run down. just I’m sure just one of those oddities of the environment that we’re in right now.
Brian Singer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude the question-and-answer session for today’s conference. And I’d like to turn the call back over to John Christmann for any closing remarks.
John Christmann: Yes. Thank you, operator. In closing, I would like to wish all of you good health as we work through this COVID-19 pandemic. We are looking forward to getting the economy back on its feet and sharing our progress in future calls. Now, back to the operator to close.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-27 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the Apache Corporation Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Announcement Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today; Gary Clark, Vice President Investor Relations. You may begin.
Gary Clark: Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's Fourth Quarter Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call with an overview by; CEO and President, John Christmann; Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO will then summarize our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Development, Planning, Reserves and Fundamentals will also be available on the call to answer questions. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 15 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our fourth quarter financial and operational supplement which can be found on our investor relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that I will turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will recap Apache's 2019 accomplishments, discuss our fourth quarter performance and conclude with an overview of our strategic approach for the next few years. For Apache 2019 was a year of both progress and challenges. Our most significant challenges were associated with Alpine High which I will discuss in a few minutes. Our progress however was on many fronts. We took steps to advance key environmental, social and governance initiatives, met our corporate goals around capital spending reduction and cash returns, further streamlined and repositioned our portfolio and strengthened our balance sheet. Specifically, over the last year we enhanced our global sustainability efforts by linking ESG goals, directly to short-term incentive compensation, initiated alignment of ESG disclosures with SASB and TCFD recommendations and began to earmark capital specifically for ESG projects. We launched a comprehensive corporate redesign to further align our organization work processes and cost structure with lower and long-term planned activity levels and we reduced upstream capital investment by 23% from 2018. We also delivered cash return on invested capital consistent with our corporate incentive compensation target of 19% and continued to streamline our portfolio with the divestment of assets in Oklahoma and the Texas, Panhandle. Internationally, we generated a substantial inventory of new drill-ready prospects in Egypt through our recent seismic and acreage evaluation initiatives. We sustained production levels in the North Sea with a 100% drilling success rate and achieved first production from our store discovery which was on-time and on budget. And at year-end, we signed a joint venture agreement with Total in Block 58 Suriname which brought in a world-class offshore operator and established a substantial capital access framework. This enabled Apache to retain a 50% working interest in the Block, while significantly reducing our exposure to potential large-scale appraisal and development spending. Moving now to the fourth quarter, oil production in the Permian Basin exceeded guidance and averaged the highest quarterly rate in Apache's history. Since mid-2017 we have operated our unconventional oil-focused program at a relatively steady and deliberate pace. This has generated highly competitive well results, solid returns and an attractive oil production growth rate in the Permian. This year we plan to reduce our Permian operated rig count and deliver a low to mid single-digit oil growth rate. At Alpine High, results were disappointing on a few fronts. In our second quarter 2019 earnings release, we spoke about the impact of the natural gas and NGL price collapse on the economic competitiveness of further investment in Alpine High. In the second half of 2019 extended flow data from key spacing and landing zone tests indicated disappointing performance of our multi-well development pads. While these tests are not fully conclusive for the entirety of Alpine High, given the prevailing price environment, further testing is not warranted at this time. As a result, we dropped the remainder of our drilling rigs in the fourth quarter and chose to defer some previously planned completions. In Egypt, gross production in the fourth quarter was relatively flat with the third quarter. Adjusted production volumes in the quarter were adversely impacted by a onetime cost recovery settlement agreed to by our partner in one of our non-operated concessions. This should have no ongoing impact on future production volumes. Strong drilling results in Egypt during the quarter position us well for 2020 and we look forward to testing some high-impact oil prospects on both new and legacy acreage beginning around midyear. Production in the North Sea increased significantly following seasonal platform maintenance turnarounds in the third quarter and first production from our store discovery in November. Startup of the Garten two well was delayed into the first quarter as previously disclosed. This well is now online and will drive a further production increase in the first quarter of 2020. Turning now to Suriname. We drilled our first well in Block 58 the Maka Central number one during the fourth quarter and subsequently announced a significant oil discovery in January. We are now working with our partner Total on an appraisal plan which will be submitted to the state-owned oil company Staatsolie in the coming months. In January, the Noble Sam Croft drillship moved from Maka to our second exploration prospect Sapakara West. As we noted in last night's press release the Sapakara well is drilling ahead to the Santonian interval as planned and we are encouraged by what we have seen thus far. Following Sapakara, we will drill a third and likely a fourth exploration test in Block 58. Looking longer term, Apache's differentiated asset portfolio and disciplined approach gives us confidence in our ability to continue to improve returns and deliver competitive share price performance relative to our peers. As demonstrated over the last few years, we clearly have a significant inventory of high-quality investment opportunities in the Permian Basin, Egypt and the North Sea. In Suriname, we have a very large-scale asset in Block 58, which may be transformational and capable of driving long-term volume growth at a very attractive return on capital. We have made the strategic decision to prioritize funding Suriname over the next few years, with a portion of the capital that would otherwise be directed towards shorter cycle growth opportunities elsewhere in the portfolio. As a result, our near-term production growth will be a bit slower than it otherwise could be but we believe the long-term potential far outweighs any short term impacts. Over the coming years our strategic approach will center around retaining free cash flow in excess of the dividend for the purpose of reducing debt, continuing to prioritize long-term returns over growth, aggressively managing our cost structure and advancing our exploration and appraisal activities in Suriname. One of the primary financial objectives is to reduce debt over the next several years. We will do this with cash that is primarily sourced from operating cash flow. As a result, our upstream capital investment will be determined by the oil price environment. For 2020 we are budgeting $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion which allows for an uncertain price environment centered around a $50 WTI oil price. In terms of capital allocation, Alpine High will receive minimal to no funding and we are shifting some capital from Permian oil projects to Egypt which is better insulated from weak oil prices due to the production sharing contracts. With this plan in 2020, we expect to maintain our current dividend payment which is yielding approximately 3.5% retain free cash flow to initiate progress on our debt reduction goals allocate, approximately $200 million to exploration and invest $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion of capital including exploration which will result in flat- to low-single-digit corporate oil production growth year-over-year. To the extent oil prices continue to fall, capital will be reduced, as will our near-term production outlook. That said if oil prices move materially higher, we will prioritize further debt reduction over increasing capital activity. Moving now to our corporate redesign initiative. We are well down the road with the process of both rightsizing and reorganizing our technical, operational and corporate support functions. The rightsizing is a recognition that we will not be returning to past levels of capital activity and need to make a permanent reduction in headcount. The new model which is enabled by a more focused portfolio is more centralized and will tie incentives to asset team performance rather than to regions. It is designed to enhance collaboration and enable greater mobility of technical personnel as capital is redirected across the portfolio. We expect to achieve at least $150 million of annual savings from overhead and operating cost reductions associated with this initiative. Over the coming months we will provide more information around the structure of the new organization. And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on our 2019 results and 2020 outlook.
Steve Riney: Thank you, John. My remarks this morning will provide a few more details covering Apache's fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. The progress to date on our organizational redesign and our 2020 financial objectives and guidance. I will also comment on our recent efforts to reduce long-term gas transportation commitments in light of the changing capital plan for Alpine High. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, Apache reported a fourth quarter 2019 consolidated net loss of $3 billion or $7.89 per diluted common share. These results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings. The most significant of these are noncash impairments of $1.4 billion related to Alpine High wells, facilities, leasehold and other upstream assets; and $1.3 billion for Altus Midstream, gathering, processing and transmission assets. We also recorded a $528 million impairment of Alpine High unproved leasehold assets, which is included in exploration expense. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $31 million or $0.08 per share. During the fourth quarter and throughout 2019, Apache maintained a very steady pace of capital activity and spending. Upstream capital investment was less than $600 million in each quarter of the year, putting us below our full year budget of $2.4 billion. Total production during the fourth quarter exceeded our guidance most notably for Permian oil, which benefited from good well performance and the timing of pad completions. From a financial perspective during 2019, we continued to fund our $376 million dividend payment, which is one of the highest yields in our peer group. We generated full year cash return on invested capital, consistent with the corporate incentive compensation goal of 19%. We paid off $150 million of debt and we refinanced a portion of our long-term debt significantly extending our maturity profile while lowering our average borrowing rate. As you may recall, anticipating Alpine High volume growth, we contracted for around one Bcf per day of long-term natural gas transportation capacity out of the Permian Basin. Consistent with our decision to substantially curtail investment in Alpine High, we are taking steps now to reduce those commitments. To-date we have eliminated approximately 310 million cubic feet per day of take-or-pay obligations and we have more in progress. As John noted, we are also making good progress with respect to our organizational redesign. We will substantially complete the redesign for our technical functions by the end of the first quarter while work on the corporate support functions and field operations will likely continue through much of 2020. We remain on target to achieve our goal of at least $150 million of annual savings and we'll get to this run rate of savings sometime in the second half of 2020. This effort will, of course, result in some one-off costs, $28 million of these costs were recognized in 2019 and make up the majority of the $33 million of transaction, reorganization and separation costs in the fourth quarter results. The remainder of these costs will be recognized in 2020. Turning now to 2020, one of our key financial goals for the year is to retain free cash flow after the dividend. This will be used to begin funding our longer term objective of paying down $937 million of debt maturing over the next four years. While the softening price environment is making this increasingly difficult, debt reduction is a key priority and we are committed to flexing the size of the capital program to ensure progress in 2020. To conclude my remarks, I would like to provide some commentary on full year 2020 and first quarter guidance, the specifics of which can be found in our fourth quarter earnings supplement. For the full year, the allocation of our capital budget is intended to balance two competing objectives, funding a proper pace of activity to test the significant long-term potential of Suriname Block 58, while at the same time investing in near-term development to sustain or grow total oil production. As John noted, we expect to deliver on both of these objectives with our $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion upstream capital program this year. Natural gas and NGL production will decline year-over-year, primarily due to the activity reduction at Alpine High. In the first quarter, Alpine High volumes will be slightly below fourth quarter 2019 levels of 95,000 BOEs per day and we expect this to decline to around 50,000 to 60,000 BOEs per day by the end of the year. These numbers do not include the impact of potential production curtailments due to negative Waha hub pricing. Turning to the cost side, because the organizational redesign will impact both the level and timing of cost savings, we are providing only first quarter estimates for G&A, LOE and exploration expense. We will update our guidance on these items as we progress through the year. On a final note, primarily as a result of the fourth quarter impairment charge, we are projecting a material decrease in DD&A. We expect DD&A per BOE for 2020 will be around $13.50. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open.
John Abbott: Good morning. It's actually John Abbott on for Doug, like it he's on a plane right now, and he's listening in on the webcast.
John Christmann: Good morning, John.
John Abbott: Yeah. We just have a couple of questions here. Staying with Suriname, you said that you like what you so far see from the shallower target. But you're also planning multiple tests. Can you elaborate on what you have seen so far? For example, have you encountered hydrocarbon bearing reservoir sands?
John Christmann: Well, as -- thanks for the question. In general, we don't like to comment on specifics about a well while it's drilling. So, what I will say is as we have drilled through the Campanian. And as I said, we are encouraged by what we have seen. We are headed on to the Santonian. And as we put in the materials last night the plan would be to run open hole logs fluid -- capture fluid samples, cores pressure, tests and so forth.
John Abbott: All right. And then for our follow-up question on the appraisal of Maka Central, what's the expected timing? Should we see a result in 2020? Can you provide any context on lateral footprint sand thickness, as we're trying to confirm our view that the Block 58 might be the deposition center of the basin?
John Christmann: At this point what I will say is we are working very closely with our partner Total. I'm not in a position to give any color, because we have to work up that plan. There's a time line where we need to deliver that to Staatsolie, which we will do. We're excited about it. We're working on it jointly and we'll be able to talk about that more in the future.
John Abbott: I appreciate, and thank you for taking our questions.
John Christmann: Your bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
Bob Brackett: Yeah. I'll try a different tactic to the former question. You mentioned fluid sampling on the Sapakara West. Do you routinely fluid sample formation water?
John Christmann: Bob, we would -- that is not something we would typically do. But I mean, it all depends on what we've seen in running the right tests according to what we've seen in the well.
Bob Brackett: Okay. Appreciate that. A quick follow-up. You mentioned $200 million of exploration. I imagine that's dominantly Suriname, but could you break out any other interesting aspects to that exploration budget?
John Christmann: Yeah. I will say the lion's share of that is Suriname. We do have some things on the unconventional side that we're slowly watching and working. But the majority of that will go to Suriname.
Bob Brackett: Great, appreciate it.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Scialla with Stifel. Your line is open.
Mike Scialla: Yeah. Good morning, everybody. I don't normally do this, but I have to give Bob kudos that was in my 20 years probably the best asked question I've heard.
John Christmann: It was a good question Mike.
Mike Scialla: Yeah. It definitely was. Steve, you had said you're reducing your commitments on from Alpine High. Just wondering what that looks like? Does that take place at the Altus level? And are you able to actually sell some of the firm's transportation that you've taken on Gulf Coast Express and Permian Highway.
Steve Riney: Yeah. Mike, so I'm not going to be able to speak to specific pipelines. We've got multiple contractual arrangements for moving gas out of the Permian Basin. And so, it's not -- also not specifically related to Alpine High in terms of the gas evacuation. It's just gas evacuation from the Permian Basin. Let me just step back from that a little bit. We mostly sell our equity production actually in basin, and therefore like on the vast facts that you received with our earnings announcement what you see is the realized price in the Permian Basin at Waha or at El Paso Permian. We have a marketing team that then recommends and implements taking actions around how do we make sure that basin prices are connected to the broader market over the long-terms? And example of an action that they might recommend and did was we need to get some pipelines built to the Permian Basin -- from the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast, and we helped FID, the two pipelines that you talked about in doing that. And that did well, and it did for a while and it will help connect the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast. Our marketing organization then manages the exposures associated with those assets. And so, we typically manage that by purchasing gas in-basin and transporting it to meet our obligations on those pipes. We have chosen now to reduce our longer-term exposure. We've accomplished getting those built by participating in the FID process. Those are obligations that do not involve Altus Midstream. That's an obligation of Apache Corporation and we've decided that we want to start reducing some of those exposures and we have initiated that process. As I said in my prepared remarks, we've contracted away. Basically we've contracted with counterparties to take over our obligation of up to 310 million cubic feet a day. That doesn't start immediately, so we still maintain some exposure to that in the short term and that's probably a good thing at this point in time. But we're taking away the longer-term exposure on some of the pipeline transport capacity that we have in the Permian Basin. And at this point we're still working on a bit more of that. We would like to bring that down just a bit more.
Mike Scialla: That's great. Thanks for the detail. And I guess sticking with Alpine High. John, how are you thinking about it now? Do you keep that as a long-term option on gas? Or do you think it makes sense to consider a divestiture there at some point?
John Christmann: I mean, what I'll say Mike, I'll go back and just take a few minutes here. But when Alpine High was announced in 2016, we had great hope for what it could mean for Apache. It had all the key ingredients of an impact play, large-scale, low-cost of entry and we had acquired the heart of the play. And in the end, a number of factors were problematic at Alpine High. First, as you just recognized gas NGL prices fell to less than half of the prices we anticipated for long-term economics. Second the lack of infrastructure prolonged the period to test full development. And this along with the sheer stratigraphic size and aerial extent increased the cost and time to do so. Third, the lack of cryogenic processing capacity did not allow us to test the NGL mix and yields until the middle of 2019, when we actually got the cryos on through Altus. Fourth, we anticipated a meaningful uplift in well productivity and a significant decrease in well cost as we move to pad and pattern development as is the case in almost all unconventional resource plays. We were able to drive cost down below our goals but the uplift in productivity did not materialize. So today it – we've got about 240,000 acres, there's about 200 of it that will kind of expire over the next three years and there's some optionality there. But if you look at the macro environment today, if we got back to an NGL market, where we were late 2018 then there's definitely some things that would be economic but how does it compete in our portfolio is another question. And so that's why we made the decision we made today.
Mike Scialla: Very good. Thank you.
John Christmann: You bet. Thank you for the question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson with Stephens. Your line is open.
Gail Nicholson: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two things. One in Egypt, in my opinion the market still continues to discount the Egyptian asset, can you talk about the inventory running room that you guys have identified post the seismic analysis in Egypt?
John Christmann: Yes Gail, what gets lost in the shuffle is you've got conventional rock what has the stratigraphic column and the aerial extent of greater than the Permian. We have over 6.2 million acres. I think with the new acreage that we've added and since 2016 and the new 3D that we're shooting, and then you look at our operational footprint, we have a very large business over there which gives us a nice backbone to kind of fill in off of. What I'm excited about is we used to be maybe six months of inventory. Today we see years of inventory and we've really high-graded some very interesting things that if they work could be game changers. And so we're very optimistic about where we are with Egypt and some of the things we've got on the drill schedule. They're off to a really good start. As we said in the prepared remarks it drove some really nice wells, Q4 and we've got some very interesting things to test. But it's Brent, the PSC really insulates you which is another nice factor as we mentioned today, we're going to be shifting a little more capital into Egypt. But I think it's through the productivity and the opportunity set that we've identified. And quite frankly, we just have a lot more inventory that's kind of drill-ready that we can prioritize and get after.
Gail Nicholson: Great. Thank you. And then on Slide 13, you guys show the 4Q 2019 on operating cash margins. Just to clarify, does the Permian cash margin include Alpine? And if so, if you remove Alpine from that number what would be non-Alpine Permian cash margin be?
John Christmann: And yes, it does include that. And in terms of with all the reorgan stuff we're doing, our numbers are going to be reported that way. So we didn't really want to break it out but Gary can probably get back with you on a follow-up or something and give you some insight.
Gail Nicholson: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade of Johnson Rice & Company. Your line is open.
Charles Meade: Good morning, John, you, your whole team there.
John Christmann: Good morning, Charles.
Charles Meade: I wanted to -- first off thanks for bringing -- or for giving us the detail on the Garten well. I believe that's slide 12 of your presentation there. And it looks like really stout rate. I wonder if you could just give us one discrete data point which is what would your net be off of that growth rate?
Dave Pursell: Charles, this is David Pursell. That's 100%. We have that prospect we have well.
Charles Meade: Got it. Got it. And -- thanks for that Dave. And then John there's been some discussion in the reports in the news media about I guess A&D opportunities in Egypt. And particularly in light of you guys reallocating some capital in that direction because of the attractiveness you see there what how would you characterize your appetite for more assets in Egypt?
John Christmann: Well, I mean, what I would say Charles is that we don't typically comment on A&D activity. I think today with the plan we have and in the market where it is today you wouldn't see us coming out-of-pocket for something. But there's an asset base over there. We have a very nice footprint. And there might be a way to do something creativity-- on a creative side.
Charles Meade: Okay. Thanks for that John.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. 
Brian Singer: Thank you. Good morning.
John Christmann: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Singer: Moving back to Suriname you mentioned the fourth exploration test would be likely. Can you just talk about the timing for making that decision? And then what next steps would be from a rig and decision-making perspective for further exploratory testing?
John Christmann: Well with the rig we've got today the Noble Sam Croft, we've got one well we've already exercised the option on and then there is another well we can drill. As I said it's very likely we will do that but we don't have to make that decision yet. And so it's an option we just haven't pulled the trigger on. But after -- if we were to elect that option which I said is likely you would -- we would finish the current well we're on we would drill the third well and then potentially the fourth well and then we will release the rig. And I'll just say that in the appraisal plan at Maka will come back with a different rig and a different time line when we're in a position that we can talk about that.
Brian Singer: Great. Thanks. And then back to the North Sea when you kind of put together the recent well and Garten declined et cetera how do you expect your production trajectory for oil to look over the course of the year?
John Christmann: It's going to be early. I mean the first quarter is going to be strong with Garten we delayed from Q4 into Q1. So it -- Garten 2 I think it's going to continue to be lumpy. We've got more wells to drill at Garten. We've got some other prospects that are interesting as we tie back. So North Sea is going to continue to be fairly lumpy based on when we bring these high rate wells on.
Brian Singer: Great. Thank you. 
John Christmann: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Your line is open. 
Leo Mariani: Yeah. Hey, guys. I know it's a bit difficult to sort of know for sure. But I guess I was just looking to kind of get a high level time line in terms of when you guys might kind of finish drilling and then some of your analysis that you talked about on the Sapakara well. Is that kind of a roughly one month type of thing 45-day type of thing? Can you just give us maybe a high level in terms of when you might be able to give us a full suite of information on that?
John Christmann: Yes, Leo as I said we don't typically like to comment on a well while it's drilling but we did learn our lesson in December at least to not to give you a little bit of an idea in terms of a comment so that's why we've said we're encouraged. We're through the Campanian we've got the Santonian to drill. And then after that we'll have some time to do the evaluation. So not also going to give you a definitive time line but we'll get to that as soon as we can after we TD the well.
Leo Mariani: Got it. Understood. Okay. And I guess just with respect to the Permian seemed like you had some very strong wells in Lee County New Mexico that you guys had reported supplemental information. Just wanted to get a sense of what the depth of your inventory is in that general area there in New Mexico?
Dave Pursell: Yes, Leo this is Dave Pursell. I think generally if you look at our unconventional inventory we have more activity in the Southern Midland Basin side than when you look at New Mexico in the Delaware Basin generally. But we have deep inventory across both basins. And as you look out we've -- we're just drilling a small fraction of our total footprint and we feel good about the long-term inventory depth both in the Southern Midland Basin and the Delaware Basin.
Leo Mariani: Okay. So I guess a lot more inventory in Southern Midland versus New Mexico? Is that the way to interpret that?
Dave Pursell: Yes, I would interpret it that way.
Leo Mariani: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is open. 
Arun Jayaram: Yeah. Good morning. John in Total's 4Q update they talked about a $2 per barrel kind of cost of acquisition. Presumably, you guys maybe approved that type of language. So I was wondering if there's any read through? I know that we're very, very early in the delineation appraisal of Suriname, but of -- sizes of potential discovered resource at this point, using that $2?
John Christmann: I would just say that is the language they put in and how they characterized it. I mean, it -- I'll just leave it at that.
Arun Jayaram: Got it, got it. Fair enough. And then, just maybe my follow-up, could you maybe elaborate, John, you talked about an appraisal plan that you'd be working on? What goes into that? And can we make any clues regarding when we could achieve first oil if your delineation efforts prove successful or the path forward to first oil?
John Christmann: Arun, what I'll say is, there's -- the agreements with the concession terms lining out a time line that you have to follow. So, you have a discovery declaration. And then, we have a window where we have to submit the discovery notice. And then, we have a window where we have to submit the appraisal plan and then, the development process. So there's a time line that we're on there. And we're working through it expeditiously. And I think, the -- us and our partner will try to accelerate those things as quickly as we can, based on the results that you get from the appraisal program.
Arun Jayaram: Okay. Thanks a lot, John.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Your line is open.
Richard Tullis: Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone. John, given the lower CapEx budget that kind of fits the current times and the allocation for the Suriname activity, of course, any assets that you see in the portfolio that may slip into the -- maybe, the better to monetize category?
John Christmann: Yes. I think, today, we look at the portfolio and we really like the balance. We've done a lot of that over the last couple of years. I mean, if you look at the, I'll call them, gas rich or gas heavy assets we divested in Canada, I'm very glad we got our SCOOP/STACK and our Mid-Continent sold last year. So, you look at the portfolio today, we're -- it's tight. We're in nice areas. There's always some small little things that we do from time to time, even within the Permian, either trades and swaps and acreage here and there that we're willing to monetize if people were interested. So, we're constantly looking at that. But I don't think there's anything that's big that we'd say, today, we need to move, or would move right now in this price environment.
Richard Tullis: That's helpful, John. And just a follow-up. How many wells were drilled to date in the Alpine High? And how many of those wells are online currently?
David Pursell: Yes, Richard. This is Dave Pursell. I don't have the exit numbers, but it's kind of in the low-200s that we've drilled and around 200 that are online.
Richard Tullis: Okay. Thank you. That’s helpful. I appreciate it. That’s all for me.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Your line is open.
Neal Dingmann: Good morning, John and team. Congrats on bucking this disastrous energy trend right now. My first question is on your Permian, you all continue to do a great job of having one of the more stable plans that are in the play. And I'm just wondering, while I assume the change in oil prices probably won't impact your pace, I'm just wondering, John, will that have an impact on how you think about spacing some of these multi-zone developments?
John Christmann: No. I mean, I think, the key for us was, we spent really -- 2016 and 2017, really very thoughtfully and methodically understanding how to develop and we got the pads early and really work through that work at that time. And so, what you've seen is, a very steady plan. I mean, we've got about nine months of rig activity just kind of lined out and it gives us the ability to work the infrastructure, do all the things we need to do ahead of that. So I don't see any changes in terms to our development approach. What we have the luxury of doing though, is backing off that capital, because it's short-cycle in nature. This is not something we have to drive forward in this price environment. So the only thing you might see, as we mentioned, the price is down where they are today, even below the range we talked about, you might see a little further slowdown, just because we had the luxury and can do that. I think it's also important to keep frac crews working and a couple of rigs working. So I'll call where we maintain our execution fitness and we continue to work on the continuous improvement to drive those results. But it's been all about getting the pads, doing the testing, looking at the long extended flow periods and really unlocking that, so we understand how the wells can perform, so you can really invest that capital as efficiently as possible.
Neal Dingmann: Great details. And then, my second question, just on the North Sea. I'm just wondering -- maybe you've already said, but I'm just wondering about, well, your potentially the same amount of downtime and I think it's 3Q and then the plan to run -- continuously run the three rigs?
John Christmann: Yes. I mean, I think, if you look today, we've had a platform rig running both at Barrel and 40s and we've had the Ocean Patriot. We will have the Ocean Patriot this year. We actually did an exploration arrangement, where we're getting carried on a couple of wells in the North Sea out there in the Barrel area which helps a little bit on the capital this year, but a similar program is what we would envision for 2020. And you do have your traditional maintenance season, which we usually get in the third quarter summer months when the weather gets a little better.
Neal Dingmann: So that will just be the typical maintenance you think, John?
John Christmann: Yes. And then really weather. I mean, it was weather is what kind of drove us to have to wait to bring Garten-2 on. So you came out of maintenance turnaround, and then we got into some pretty rough weather in the fourth quarter and that was what kind of had us kick some things back.
Neal Dingmann: Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeanine Wai: Hi. Good morning everyone.
John Christmann: Good morning.
Jeanine Wai: Good morning. My first question is on maintenance CapEx, maintenance mode. At the 2020 CapEx budget level, you're around maintenance mode at the low end I believe. And so looking forward to 2021, are you able to maintain flat year-over-year production at a similar $1.6 billion CapEx budget? Or are there some one-offs this year that are kind of driving that number lower? So, I guess, what I'm getting at is that next year there could be some incremental cash flow from Altus with the pipelines, so that can help fund Suriname CapEx?
Steve Riney: Yeah, Jeanine, this is Steve. So I think the first thing we got to do is there's a lot of people out there like to talk about maintenance capital and lots of uses of that terminology. And I think we like to think about things like that in a purist way, and so we need to be clear what we're talking about. For us maintenance capital, means, we maintain all the volumes and we pay the dividend, but not necessarily any free cash flow creation. It's equally important that you look at how those definitions vary over a time frame. You're going to have a maintenance capital, some people think of maintenance capital as well it's just the next year. And the next year that's one of those cases of well, how long can you hold your breath. And maintenance capital for a year can be pretty darn low. We like to think of maintenance capital at least in a five-year to 10-year time frame and so that includes ongoing asset integrity spend and that includes spending on inventory progression so that you can maintain production over that five-year to 10-year period. But you can also think of maintenance capital over a longer-term 20-plus years, and then you need to start introducing exploration spend as well. And so we don't bother with the one-year definition, because we don't want to test how long we can hold our breath. We just wouldn't bother with a one-year maintenance -- maintenance spend program. In the five-year to 10-year time frame, we've been pretty consistent for the last five years saying, we're somewhere around $45 WTI. We can pay the dividend, maintain oil production volume with no free cash flow retention. And is it 44%, is it 46%? It's somewhere around the $45 WTI range. It's been there for a number of years now. If you go to the 20-year plus definition, that's probably in the $48 WTI range. That gives us enough money to spend on exploration like we're doing now and we've specifically budgeted for 2020 $200 million of exploration capital. And so that's the way we like to think of it. Another way to think of it for us is that if you're in a $50 to $55 world for the long-term, for the next several years, we can continue to fund the dividend, we can fund some cash to pay down debt as we are talking about, we can sustain oil production volume or grow it slowly over that four-year period, and we can fund Suriname to First Oil. And I think that's an interesting way to be thinking about maintenance capital as well. And, of course, success in Suriname is going to significantly lower that maintenance capital level on WTI prices, because of the structure of the capital carry that we have in our joint venture agreement with Total. So you get out a few years from now that maintenance capital falls way below that $45 to $48 WTI price environment, because of that capital carry. In terms of specifically looking at -- there are a lot of different ways you can look at what we've talked about for 2020. If you go to the $1.6 billion capital range, the low end of our range, that's contemplating a $46 to $47 WTI price. It means, we still pay the dividend and we fund the $200 million of exploration spend out of that $1.6 billion, and we're probably sustaining production volume at that level pretty flat for 2020 year-over-year. At the high end, the $1.9 billion capital, you're probably in the $53 to $55 range. You're paying the dividend and spending $200 million on exploration. You're retaining $150 million to $200 million of free cash flow for future debt pay down. And in that case you're growing oil production in the low to mid single-digits for 2020. That's a long-winded answer, but I hope that ticks all the boxes for you.
Jeanine Wai: Oh no, I think, I definitely appreciate all the detail there. That's very helpful to know how you're thinking about it. Maybe just a short follow-up on that, following up on some of the other questions and some of the things that you just mentioned. You said potentially earlier in the call about accelerating the development process in Suriname if you had the opportunity to do so. So what are the key -- what of the governors are facing kind of medium-term Suriname CapEx. You mentioned prioritizing Suriname. It sounds like from what you just said, you're committed to funding Suriname out of free cash flow. We have seen prior precedents, where folks try to pre-fund big major capital projects like this with asset sales. So I just wanted to clarify whether you're committed to funding Suriname out of free cash flow? Or a combination of free cash flow plus any sale proceeds?
Steve Riney: Yeah, Jeanine. So number one, hopefully I didn't say anything earlier that would lead anyone to the conclusion that we're trying to accelerate development in Suriname. I think, it'll take its proper pace and that's what it will be between us and our partner as we agreed to that. So in terms of funding the activity in Suriname, first of all by our joint venture agreement with Total, it should be clear we were willing to spend 50/50 heads up on exploration, because we are very excited about the exploration opportunities in Suriname and we believe obviously that they'll continue to be successful. When you get into appraisal and development and that's where the capital carry kicks in and starting with appraisal of Maka and any development spend that might come from that and appraisal from any further exploration successes, the $0.875 of every $1 will be spent by Total and $0.125 by Apache. And so we intend to fund any of that for the next four years out of operating cash flow. We don't think we'll have any problem doing that. If we have a problem doing that that means we're doing a heck of a lot of appraisal in development and that would be a great problem to have.
Jeanine Wai: Okay, great. Thank you for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. Out next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Scott Gruber: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
John Christmann: You bet.
Scott Gruber: So turning to the cost out program, how should we think about the $150 million roughly splitting between overhead and ops? And do you think you'll be able to achieve the full run rate of savings by year-end?
John Christmann: I think at a run rate base, we'll be able to get there. I mean, lion share of that is likely going to come out of the overhead piece but we're well on our way and working through that and we should be able to get to that type of run rate later this year.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And then you took some upfront charges associated with the program in 4Q. How do you think about upfront charges they potentially hit in 2020 as you restructure the business?
Steve Riney: Yeah, we'll obviously be taking the one-off costs associated with that. We'll be recognizing those on a quarterly basis. We did recognize some of that I think the number was $28 million in the fourth quarter, out of the $33 million that were in that one line item on our P&L. And we haven't put out an estimate of the total cost but we'll probably do that as we go through the next few quarters.
Scott Gruber: Okay, that’s it from me. Thank you.
John Christmann: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum with Cowen. Your line is open.
David Deckelbaum: Good morning guys, and nice job and nice update. Thanks for the time. I just wanted to ask you, you outlined what the cost guidance was in the first quarter just in terms of your margins, as I guess the year progresses here and you have growth coming from several other areas and Alpine High declining, how do you look at those cash costs I guess on LOE and GP&T by the fourth quarter of 2020 relative to that $825 million and $75 million in the first quarter?
Steve Riney: Yeah, David, we intentionally just gave one-quarter of guidance on that, and I'd prefer not to get into any more than that at this point in time. We'll give more guidance as we go through the year as we get more clarity on what those costs are going to be given the ongoing cost focus program and the pace of change of that program. So let us do that as we go through the next few quarters.
David Deckelbaum: Sure. I'll be patient, but appreciate it. If I could ask I guess secondarily to the other adding on to that. What are you all assuming I guess for the annualized decline out of Alpine High? And those total volumes that you have in the U.S. that are only down slightly on an annualized basis?
Dave Pursell: Yeah. So this is Dave Pursell. When you think about Alpine, we're not adding any completions this year. So you're going to see effectively the unconventional blowdown. So you'll have a steep decline in the first year and then every year after that the decline will moderate. So think about something in the -- on an annual basis in the mid-30% for the first year and then it will moderate in the -- in years two, three and four.
David Deckelbaum: Got it. Thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotia. Your line is open.
Paul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning. Two questions. On the $150 million on the restructuring do you -- restructuring saving, do you have a rough estimate between how much is on the P&L side and how much in the capital cost?
Steve Riney: No, we don't have an estimate of that at this point in time.
Paul Cheng: Okay. On the -- on Permian in 2020, you're going to be five to six rigs. Do you have a split between the Midland and Delaware Basin?
Dave Pursell: Yes, Paul, this is David Pursell. On a -- if you think about it in terms of gross completions, it's about 60% Southern Midland Basin and 40% on the Delaware side.
Paul Cheng: Okay. A final one for me. North Sea if we look at your portfolio say over the next five years I mean Suriname is very exciting and Egypt looked like you guys have some high hopes. And look like North Sea is probably not necessarily going to receive a no capital attention from that standpoint. So, should we look at North Sea say five years from now you're still consider as a core part of your long-term portfolio? Or that you may need to be revisiting that?
John Christmann: And I think today if you look at what we're doing in the North Sea, I'm quite proud. I mean we can look out and have three years of pretty stable production between the two. The volumes at barrel are lumpy as we're bringing on subsea tiebacks into our kind of our infrastructure there. 40s is all about the water management program and flattening that decline and managing our cost side. So, I think today we look out and quite frankly we've made a lot of progress over the last three to four years on North Sea and the outlook for the next several years looks as good as it's looked from a planning perspective as I've seen in a while.
Paul Cheng: Okay. But I mean are you going to put more capital into that? Or that the essentially has seen some one of the maintenance mode?
John Christmann: I mean we're definitely spending capital. In terms of is it an area we're going to go out and try to consolidate and buy more properties and add that no. But I think we've got a lot of left -- life left in these assets and there's a lot we can do on the cost side. And Steve you'd something you want to add?
Steve Riney: Yes, I'd just requote that famous quote of "rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated" when it comes to the North Sea. In 2003, when Apache bought the North Sea assets the 40s field it was scheduled for abandonment in 2012. Today, it's scheduled for abandonment in the 2030s and that keeps moving out. So, there's a lot to do in the North Sea. And I wouldn't worry too much about the next three to five years.
Paul Cheng: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy.
Michael Hall: Thanks. A lot's been addressed. I guess I just want to kind of circle back to the comment in the prepared remarks around just the longer-dated growth outlook being moderated as you're trying to bring Suriname on? Is It right then to just think about basically what we're seeing with the 2020 program is basically what we should hold flat until we think about Suriname coming on? And basically the businesses are in maintenance mode. And with that you can then fund the work that's required to bring Suriname to fruition? Is that the right way to think about it big picture?
John Christmann: Michael, it's really going to depend on what the prices do in between because we gave a range on the capital at $1.6 billion you're closer to that mode at $1.9 billion. We're going to show a little bit of growth. And so and quite frankly if we need to go lower we will. And if we needed to let things move down a hair we are not afraid to do that because we're going to prioritize paying the dividend funding Suriname and paying down some debt. So, we're very comfortable with where we are. We've got a differential asset base. We've got lower decline rates because of the conventional assets in a lot of our areas. And so we feel very comfortable with kind of where we are over the next three to five years with that.
Steve Riney: Yes. I just Michael I'll just add -- this is Steve just going back to the comments I just made a few minutes ago. For the next several years at $50 to $55, which other than today people have been generally talking about that's kind of the right price environment, should be posting on with all recognition appropriate recognition of where prices are today and where they're headed. At $50 to $55 we can do all of those things John just talked about. We can pay the dividend. We can fund Suriname to First Oil. We can retain enough free cash flow to pay down debt the $937 million of debt that will mature over the next four years. And we can sustain or even grow. You get to the $55 price environment -- we can grow oil production slightly over that time period.
Michael Hall: Okay, that's helpful. And that's kind of contemplating like a similar four-well per year type exploration program. Is that reasonable?
Dave Pursell: Well that's just that's assuming $200 million a year spent on exploration.
Michael Hall: Okay. And then on a more near-term basis just kind of curious on the kind of cadence I guess in the Permian on the oil program there. I mean is it basically just flat all year? Or is there a low point that we ought to be considering in the 2Q, 3Q timeframe before you kind of bring things back up in the back of the year? Just curious.
John Christmann: No, it's a steady program, right? So we've got our unconventional program growing and we've got some of the CBP and some of those things slightly declining. So – but it's a pretty steady program. That's the one thing. If you go back to mid-2017, we've been real steady with the program and as a result it puts us in a pretty even cadence.
Michael Hall: Great. That's helpful. Appreciate it guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Silverstein with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Josh Silverstein: Two quick questions for you guys on Suriname here. On the Maka well you mentioned that the – I guess, the joint design wasn't to optimally place the well in the thicker zones there. I was wondering if that was the same thing at Sapakara? Or if you guys are trying to target somewhat differently there?
John Christmann: Yeah I would just say, Josh, it's a function of – you've got your seismic ties and you're working in. This was really our -- Maka was our first well and two Block 58. And so you learn things as you go. And what we've got is we have multiple stack targets in there and we lined it up to kind of drill what we thought would be optimal on the few of them and we kind of validated that. So just – so – just the point was had we moved over we would have probably had a different number in terms of net fee to pay and so forth. And – but you learn that and that's what the appraisal programs will tell you as you start to work through any potential discovery that you have.
Josh Silverstein: Got it. Thanks for that. And then maybe, we haven't talked much about the rest of Suriname and obviously Block 53 is a smaller working interest I think you're at 45%. But let's just say you guys have additional success in the second third and fourth wells on Block 58. Any reason why you guys wouldn't go and test Block 53 next year as part of the exploration program?
John Christmann: No. And we'll have a decision to make on Block 53. We have a 45% working interest in there with our two partners and we do believe there's potential in Block 53 and it's something we'll talk about in the future.
Operator: Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions. I will now turn the call over to John Christmann for closing remarks.
John Christmann: Thank you for joining us on our call this morning. In closing, I'd like to leave you with these final thoughts. If you look at Apache today we have a diversified portfolio and are able to shift capital as appropriate for the commodity price environment. We are foregoing short-cycle near-term growth and prioritizing long-term returns, sustaining the dividend and debt paydown. Guyana Suriname is proving to be a super basin where we hold an anchor block with a world-class partner and have created an advantageous capital structure for appraisal and development. We're encouraged by what we have seen so far in our second well and we have a third and likely fourth well to follow in 2020. We look forward to sharing more information in the future. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-31 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Nicole, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark. Please go ahead, sir.
Gary Clark: Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation’s third quarter financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Due to a personnel matter, Tim Sullivan is unable to join us today, so Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President of Planning Reserves and Fundamentals will provide additional operational color. Following that Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO will summarize our third quarter financial performance. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 20 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday’s press release, I hope you’ve had the opportunity to review our third quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. On today’s conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today’s call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt’s tax barrels. Finally, I’d like to remind everyone that today’s discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today’s call, I will discuss Apache’s approach to delivering value in the current environment, provide high level direction on our 2020 capital budget, and conclude with some comments on our third quarter performance and fourth quarter outlook. The market has come to view the lower oil and gas price environment that has been in place since 2014, a structural in nature and unlikely to improve for the foreseeable future. Compounding this, investors are frustrated with excessive capital investment by U.S. producers and pursued the growth which is common with expense of both return on and return of capital. For these and other reasons, the broad energy sector is out of favor and there is very little investor interest in publicly traded E&P companies. In response as an industry, we must generate more free cash flow and return it to investors on a more consistent basis while continuing to operate responsibly and increasing our focus on emissions reduction. In this regard, Apache’s primary objectives are simple and straight forward, deliver competitive risk adjusted returns with a long-term moderate pace of growth, improve our free cash flow yield to level consistent with mature industrial sectors, and progress our sustainability initiatives. As we have done for the last several years, Apache will budget using a conservative price tag, influx our capital program in response to price volatility. We have taken a number of steps to adapt to the lower commodity price environment of the last five years. These include streamlining our portfolio, making substantial improvements to our capital allocation process, and significantly reducing our head cost. Apache has historically employed a decentralized region focus approach to operations. In recent years, we have centralized certain key activities and today see an opportunity to capture greater efficiencies by taking further steps in that direction. To accomplish this, we have initiated a comprehensive redesign of our organizational structure and operations that will position us to be competitive for the long term. This process which began in late summer should be largely completed by the end of the first quarter. We are targeting at least a $150 million of combined annual savings and look forward to updating you on our progress in the future. As we look ahead to 2020, our capital planning process is underway and we will disclose a final budget with our fourth quarter results in February. Based on current strip prices, we anticipate a 2020 upstream capital budget that would be 10% to 20% below this year’s program of $2.4 billion. This will enable Apache to generate organic free cash flow that covers the dividend and puts us on pace to fund a multiyear debt reduction program while also delivering modest year-over-year oil production growth. We anticipate directing the vast majority of our Permian Capital in 2020 to more oil weighted projects in the Midland and Delaware Basins. In Egypt, we have taken significant steps to build and enhance our drilling inventory and assessing the potential for increase investment in the future. And in the North Sea, we intend to maintain a consistent level of activity year-over-year. Turning to Suriname, we have retained the Nobel Sam Croft drill the second and third wells on Block 58 in 2020, with an options still outstanding on a fourth well. We are planning to drill these wells at a 100%, but that might change should we choose the farm down our interest. As we progress through the 2020 planning process, we continue to monitor commodity fundamentals and evaluate multiple capital allocations scenarios under a number of different price tags across our diverse portfolio. We look forward to providing details on our outlook in February. Next, I will comment briefly on our third quarter performance and fourth quarter outlook before turning it over to Dave for more details. In the Permian Basin, our oil production in the second half of the year has been moderately impacted by some unplanned downtime events and to ways in our completion schedule and well maintenance timing. Consequently, we are now projecting fourth quarter Permian oil volumes of approximately 100,000 barrels per day. At Alpine High, we have reduced our drilling activity to two rigs and have chosen to defer some fourth quarter completions into 2020. This lower activity set combined with a decrease production outlook on one of our multi-well pads has results in an approximate 5% reduction in our fourth quarter Alpine High guidance. Internationally, third quarter production was in line with guidance and our outlook for the fourth quarter is unchanged. Egypt continues to deliver excellent well results and a high drilling success rate. In the North Sea, we have a significant exploratory success coming online at store this month and a second well at Garten coming online around year end. The log on the Garten well shows a much larger than expected hydrocarbon column and should generate positive production momentum as we enter 2020. In Suriname, we spud the market central number one in late September and expect to TD the well in November and a depth of approximately 6,325 meters as measured from the deck of the drillship. The well is designed to test multiple targets and is located roughly seven miles from the Suriname/Guyana maritime border. With the recent exercise of our option to drill a second and third well on Block 58, in conjunction, some optional future well commitments, Apache has the ability to retain the entirety of Block 58 with no relinquishment requirements until June of 2026. This provides sufficient time to execute a comprehensive exploratory program over this large block and initiate development activities as warranted. In closing, we are taking numerous decisive actions to improve our performance and positioning in this difficult macro environment. Apache has several key differentiators that enhanced our investment proposition. Our diversified portfolio affords the flexibility to allocate capital across to all three hydrocarbon streams and among conventional and unconventional assets as warranted by market conditions. We have a deep and diverse acreage position across the Permian Basin. Our international assets generate strong and stable free cash flow driven by premium pricing for oil, gas and NGLs. The returns generated by these assets are highly competitive within our portfolio and tend to be less sensitive to downside commodity price volatility. And lastly, Apache has excellent organic exploration opportunities in each of its three key regions as well as a potentially transformational position offshore Suriname. With that, I will turn the call over to Dave Pursell, who will provide some operational details on the quarter.
Dave Pursell: Thanks, John, and good morning. Our strong operational results for the third quarter reflect the benefits of the diversified portfolio. Adjusted production of 391,000 barrels of oil equivalent is nearly flat with the previous quarter, which included approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from assets in the Mid-Continent region that we divested during the second quarter. We are advancing a number of exploration programs both internationally and in the U.S., and development activities continue at a steady pace and our legacy U.S., North Sea and Egypt regions. During the third quarter, we drilled and completed 64 gross wells, 48 in the US, 14 in Egypt and two in the North Sea. U.S. third quarter production totalled 266,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the Midland Basin, we continue to drill high productivity oil wells. Our third quarter activity included an 11 well, 1.5 mile pad at Azalea located in the Midland County. This pad produces from the Lower Spraberry shale, Wolf Camp A and B and Lower Cline formation. The Lower Cline well tested in new landing zone with favourable results, achieving an average 30 day IP of 1,270 barrels of oil equivalent per day at 72% oil. Plans are underway to drill future Lower Cline wells to further delineate the Cline potential across our Midland Basin acreage. In Reagan County, we drilled the five well 2 mile pad. In the Hartgrove area, producing from the Wolfcamp B1 and B4 formations, 30-day IP averaged 1,150 barrels of oil equivalent per day with 79% of oil with D&C cost averaging a very efficient $7.2 million per well. And in the Delaware Basin, we drill five wells with 1 mile laterals at Dixieland at an average cost per well of less than $5.3 million. As we outlined last quarter, we are still feeling the effects of completing timing on our Permian oil production. We are on pace to put all 88 plan Midland in Northern Delaware Basin wells online, but many of them pushed back throughout the year. We have 25 wells schedule with online dates in November or December, which based on their timing, will add only minimum production to the fourth quarter. At Alpine High, we brought 15 wells online during the quarter. This included several wells from our 14 well Blackfoot Barnett pad in the Northern Flank. We have now drilled four large multi-well pads in this area and this most recent Barnett pad has thus far underperformed relative to the adjacent Mont Blanc, Barnett pad. All 14 Blackfoot wells were completed sequentially before commencing flow back operations. As a result, the significant volume of frac water was pumped into the small areas of reservoir, which may have impacted well productivity. We took advantage of a shutting period to soak this pad for approximately 60 days. The wells have been return to production at higher rates, additional modelling is underway to better understand the performance of these wells. Moving to our international regions, adjusted production came in a little higher than projected at 125,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In Egypt, following up on the discovery announced last quarter in our new East Bahariya area, we have received the development lease and have drilled the second well the Cobra-2, which is producing approximately 3,000 barrels of oil per day. We are currently drilling a third well with plans for a fourth well later this year. In the Matruh Basin, the Biruni-1X well tested 5,000 barrels of oil per day from the AEB 6 reservoir plus 6 million cubic feet of gas and 228 barrels of condensate per day from the Safa reservoir. We are currently drilling and offsetting the future expansion potential. And in the Shushan Basin, we had a recent exploration success the Anti-1X which tested 47 million cubic feet and 1,700 barrels of condensate per day from the Shifa formation. Turning to the North Sea, third quarter production was impacted by annual turnaround maintenance from which we expect the significant production rebound in the fourth quarter. We have had extremely successful drilling campaign this year, having drilled 10 producers with no dry-holes. Our latest North Sea success at the Garten-2, which encountered approximately 1,200 feet of net pay, in the prolific Beryl reservoir across three fall blocks, this compares favourably to the Garten 1, which came online in November 2018 to the 30-day IP of 13,000 barrels of oil and 17 million cubic feet of gas per day from 700 feet of pay. The Garten-2 is expected to be online around year end. Apache holds the 100% working interest in the Garten complex, which will have several follow on wells. The first well at our store development is scheduled for initial production next month. This is a high rate gas condensate well which we anticipate will initially produce over 30% oil. The well will be tied back to the existing infrastructure that connects to the Beryl alpha platform. We plan to drill second production later next year. More detail drilling pad and well highlights can be seen in our third quarter financial and operational supplement. Thank you. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Riney: Thank you, Dave. On today’s call, I will review third quarter financial results, provide a few updated to our 2019 guidance, and briefly share some thoughts on 2020. As noted in the press release issued last night under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported a third quarter 2019 consolidated net loss of $170 million or $0.45 per diluted common share. These results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings which were typically excluded by the investment community in their published earnings estimates. The most significant difference was a $53 million valuation allowance for deferred income tax benefits. Excluding this and other smaller items, adjusted earnings for the third quarter were a loss of $108 million or $0.29 per share. Production volumes were strong, but oil and NGL realizations weaken during the quarter. Gas prices increased a bit with some improvement at Waha hub, but generally remain very low. All major expense items were in line with or below our guidance for the quarter with the exception of DD&A, which rose to $17.30 per BOE. This was primarily due to reduced proved reserves at Alpine High associated with the recent deterioration in the NGL and natural gas prices. Both the GCX gas pipeline and the Shin Oak NGL pipeline were commissioned during the third quarter. With transport capacity on both of these pipelines, Apache now has access to attractive marketing margins over and above the pipeline test. In terms of full year 2019 guidance, we are increasing our annual DD&A to $15.25 per BOE for the impacts previously described. There are few other smaller changes to full year 2019 guidance, all of which can be found in our financial and operational supplement. As John indicated, we are deep into the planning process for 2020 and beyond. As in past years, we will take a conservative approach to pricing assumptions. We will plan for free cash flow over and above our normal dividend. At current strip pricing, this would indicate a 10% to 20% reduction in capital from 2019. Through the pricing cycle, we believe this approach can combine an attractive free cash flow yield with a moderate pace of production growth. For the next few years, most free cash flow will be used to reduce debt. Our debt maturity profile is now in good shape with just under $1 billion of debt maturating in the 2021 to 2023 timeframe. Our plan is to retire all of this debt as it comes due. As a reminder, for reporting purposes, Apache consolidates Altus' long-term debt. This debt non-recourse to Apache and amounted to $235 million at the end of the third quarter. So as we look forward to 2020, Apache is in a good situation, while the gas and NGL price environment will cause a slow down at Alpine High. We have a well diversified portfolio to allocate capital towards more oil focused opportunities. We will continue to be long-term returns focus with an appropriate balance of free cash flow and moderate growth. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Doug Leggate: John, I wonder if I could hit a couple of things first of all, at a high level, I understand you haven’t given guidance for 2020, but will you see modest growth, what is that mean?
John Christmann: We don’t see any modest any this point, Doug. We’re in the middle of the planning process, kind of pace, we’ve been on what is leave at the modest.
Doug Leggate: Okay. I thought that would be quick answer, but so appreciate you’re trying to at least no answering the question. My second one is on Suriname, much and you’re going to get low on this. But I wanted to ask a very specific issue around Suriname, you’ve said for sometime the Apache had a differentiated view of the block. My question is that, you've never released the result of the Popokai well, but a couple of your engineers did talk about the Popokai changed your view all to be thermal maturity of your block. So wonder if I could ask you to characterize, what are the type of targets you’re looking for and address specifically whether you believe this is our predominantly gas prone area that you’re testing? And any color around the spud specific issue would be really appreciated?
John Christmann: Well, the first thing I’ll say Doug is, the team was very impressed with the work that we did from the data that’s out there. So, we thought you do a fantastic job on your report. We said that we have seven different play types on Block 58. The Maka-1 Central well is going to be targeting two of those play types. They’re in the Cretaceous. And I will just suggest that we obviously feel like the, we would be in an oil window or we wouldn't be placing a well there.
Doug Leggate: I appreciate that. Last one very quickly, as I wonder if you could just address the recent management change and followed by price capabilities in Suriname, and I would note that I believe you saying the PSC before Mr. Kim and joined Apache. So if you could just over some clarification that would be great?
John Christmann: Actually, we picked this block up in 2015. Steve had been on board with us, but he was not working the conventional exploration stuff at that time. So, this is something that actually we did on my watch early in 2015, before any other results were down in Guyana or our wells. So, Steve did not have anything to do with us getting into Suriname or taking this block. Secondly, I want to thanks Steve for his time here. He made great contributions to the organization and is truly a world-class explore. As we disclosed on the call today, I have been thinking about a long-term vision for the Company and working on some significant organizational changes. Steve's remaining tenure was shorter than the time I was planning for. So that require he and I to have a conversation around succession. I propose an appropriate transition in very simply he just elected to resign, but it had nothing to do with Suriname.
Operator: The question is from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.
John Freeman: Hi, John. The first one on, just sort of the initial commentary that you've provided on 2020, so just, it sounds like from I guess the high level when we think capital allocation, you basically said just assume kind of North Sea would be kind of flat year-over-year. Egypt based on the success you’ve had and I assume additional information you’re giving from the seismic shoot that you should see an increase investment there. And then it just sounded like in terms of kind of Permian/Alpine High just more of a shifting of capital there some of the more oiler areas at Midland, Delaware. So, when I think about just as overall region, when I think historically all kind of 70:30 kind of U.S. international. Just I guess how much that could kind of change, as it sounds like just really international the only kind of directionally going up?
John Christmann: Yes. I would say, John, first and foremost, we spent more money at Alpine High and that capital is going to come down, so that in itself will change those the parentages of pie. The exploration spend in Suriname could be a little larger as well, so that also would tilt the international. But -- and then, we stated that the Permian capital is going to come down, but in general the oil drillings is going to go up, so...
John Freeman: And then just the follow-up until we’re given any additional information, can we just contain to assume for these additional, these other two Suriname wells around that $60 million to $65 million per well somewhere to the first?
John Christmann: Yes. I mean the spread shouldn’t be changed in much. I mean we’ve got Nobel Sam Croft. Rates were negotiated and there is actually another extension we could take and have just preserved that option for the future. So, it's going be pretty similar. A lot of that will just depend on what we do and how long we’re on the wells and how much testing and all those things will drive that cost.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer: I wanted to see, just a follow-up on John’s question there. More a bigger picture, if you could paint a picture of how Suriname success or lack of excess is going to impact your capital allocation strategy? So, in success case, would you finance development fully and entirely via selling down a stake? Would there be openness to outspending cash flow? Would you need to issue equity? Would you think about just reducing activity elsewhere in the portfolio? And in a lack of success case, what would be your interest for need for inorganic portfolio replenishment?
John Christmann: Well, Brian, we feel good about the portfolio with or without Suriname. So I think we got a very diverse portfolio, we’ve got great optionality, we’ve got lots of onshore unconventional inventory that is all weighted as well as some optionality on the rich gas side. We got good inventory both on our international areas and then obviously Suriname offers a new playground for us. So, we feel good about the inventory and feel good about the direction of the Company, I think that’s one thing. If you look back over the last four years from where we sit today, from where we were, we have a lot of more inventory than we have on all fronts. So, as far as financing or success case at Suriname, we still have a 100% equity in that block, and we made a very clear that our intent would be to likely bring in a partner, and we feel like it that would play a role and how that would be funded. So, I am not in a position to give you a lot more color than that, but I don’t see us having to stop some of the other things that would be doing or significantly stressing our balance sheet. Steve, do you want to add anything.
Steve Riney: No, I think that’s good John.
Brian Singer: And then, the follow-up is with regard to the onshore inventory you mentioned, some improved performance or economics on the Cline. Can you just talk to what you’re seeing in terms of supply cost coming down either by cost reduction or improve performance in the Permian? And then any update on exploratory efforts in the onshore?
John Christmann: At this point, we do not have anything that we prepared to update on the onshore exploratory side. I will say in general, cost are, it's kind of mix bag, some things are coming down and some of the services there has been some slowdowns. Some of it remains tight, so we’re managing that, so it's really a function of the individual services. I think what you’re seeing now is having been in kind of a development mode with those pads. A lot of the synergies and things were drive out or in the cost to really more function just the efficiencies that come with the larger scale, pad development where you have all the infrastructure in place. I’ll put it over to Dave to comment on the Cline.
Dave Pursell: Yes. So, thanks John. The Cline well just a little more color than in the prepared remarks. It's one well that it’s been online for 120 days. We’re happy with its performance. We look at our portfolio when we think we have opportunities under a couple of field at least. And so, you’ll be hearing more about that as we kind of get to the end of 2020.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.
Bob Brackett: Good morning. I’m looking at that TVD of the Market Central at 6,325 meters, that's considerably, say, several thousand feet deeper than Haimara, which is maybe your closest offset well from the industry. Does that suggest you’re trying to tap the top of the Jurassic? Or is that landing somewhere in the Cretaceous?
John Christmann: I would just say at this point that would you know most of our targets, the two plays will be testing here are in the Cretaceous.
Bob Brackett: Bob here, but I appreciate the compliment. A quick question then, what about the Miocene? You didn’t mention that as one of the play types?
John Christmann: At this point where you've gone through a full evaluation of all of the play types, so, Bob that’s where we are I mean this is two in the Cretaceous in a very nice sticks section.
Bob Brackett: Yes, concurred. In terms of the modest oil production growth that you highlighted, should I stay specifically into focus on oil production growth and the gas will be sort flat or down or just gas track with that oil?
John Christmann: We would be emphasizing the modest oil plays.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles Meade: I wanted to understand that there is a lot of focus on this first well, but I wonder if I could get you to talk a little bit more about these next two wells that are going to come after. My guess would be that since you've already got the -- the rig going to drill these back-to-back that you already have those two locations mapped out and that they're going to be independent of your result on this first well. But can you talk about whether that's right? Or how you -- how those next 2 wells are going to go?
John Christmann: Charles, we actually permitted nine different wells. So, there is multiple, multiple target. I’ll just say since it is the first well in this area that we’ll be gathering data and there are some decision through things we’ll do based on the data we collect. So, we’ve got a pretty good idea where we want to go, but information and confirmation is certain things will drive the exact thoughts and process.
Charles Meade: And then if I could go back to the Blackfoot pad in the Alpine High. Dave, I appreciate the comments you made about that in the prepared remarks, but I was curious you mentioned -- I believe, I heard you mentioned that you left the frac water soak on those -- on that pad for, I think, 60 days. Can you talk about -- is that -- has that been a standard procedure at Alpine High? Is that something new or different view you chose to do? Or maybe just -- maybe it was just the timing? Can you talk about whether that's the standard plan whether it's a one-off? And what you're going to learn going forward from this?
Dave Pursell: Yes, Charles, good question. We’ve had some opportunities in the past to soak wells, really do the facility constrain so what we found in some cases and well performance improve of soak. When we frac the 14 well Blackfoot pad remember that was, the wells were all completed sequentially. So, we put a lot of produced water into a relatively compact part of the reservoir. And we thought, well, let's taken the advantage of well commodity prices, initiate a 60-day soak. Really trying to understand is that relative permeability issue? Or what are the mechanisms for the underperformance? We’ve had the pad back online for about 30 days. The gas rate came back above. The pretty soak rate and it's actually holding in pretty flat, which say or was some impact in the condensate rate came up, higher than the pre-soak rate. So, what we’re doing Charles, we’re evaluating that, we have a team of folks doing some detail work on the Blackfoot and all of the multi-well pads that we've drilled and completed today.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Gail Nicholson with Stephens.
Gail Nicholson: I am looking at Egypt, you guys had a really nice results there this quarter. When you guys look at cash 2020 and CapEx, do you guys have any idea -- an updated idea what maintenance CapEx is Egypt would be to keep adjusted 72,000 flat?
John Christmann: Gail, we’ve got results from the new 3D that we're starting to see from our prospect inventory should improve is what we’re excited about. So, we don’t really look at rig count to keep things flat because we’re just working on what’s project are going to be best in terms of the allocation. But as we’ve said, with the new inventory and the things we’re seeing, I think there is a potential to actually return Egypt on the oil side to grow and so, we’re tired about that.
Gail Nicholson: And then just looking the recent exploration at the [indiscernible] G12 and the [indiscernible] condensate discovery. How does that I guess maybe change future potential gas development in Egypt?
John Christmann: Well, we’ve got a lot of infrastructure from Qasr. And so, there is the nice thing about some things is they can be tied in. Most of our drilling will be focused on oil, but we do have a lot of gas infrastructure and capacity. So, it’s not a big deal, and if we find it and it still very economic for us is as we get about 265 NIM for that.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Mike Scialla with Stifel.
Mike Scialla: Just wanted to see if there anything you could say about what you've seen so far in the Maka Central wells at this point?
John Christmann: I’d say we’re drilling ahead that we are now in the shallower targets. And Mike, the only thing I’ll say at this time point is, is that, we have not seen anything that would be unexpected.
Mike Scialla: And just wanted if you could give any more color on the organizational initiatives that you put in place?
John Christmann: Yes. I think we see an opportunity to reduce kind of take a $150 million out of the system. I think it's going to unable to deliver more proactive planning and improve capital allocation, which is something we strived to continually do. I think it's going to enable us to advance our resource progression from access to exploration to the development and operations is going to allow us to right size both the corporate and regional offices to more efficiently support the new organization. We’re going to minimize duplication, eliminate some redundancies and it also is going to help us really enable the collaboration on the value adding technology adoption.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.
Neal Dingmann: John, my question is based on the early strong Lower Cline test that you've seen in that Driver Schrock pad. Do you have plans to increase activity targeting this zone? Or I guess maybe I’ll ask a different way, could you all just maybe discuss your upcoming multi-zone development pad around the Midland Basin?
John Christmann: Yes. I think we’ve got our inventory so lined out, but it doesn’t impact the next couple of pads. But what it does is, we’re constantly dipping down and testing things that we can add in the future. And so, we can’t jump around next pad and move here. I mean we’ve really got this machine lined out and we’re in an execution mode. But we factor that in, we’re testing things that we think and add material inventory and then we will start planning that into our future pads is the way I think about that and is kind of where we approach things.
Neal Dingmann: And then just one follow-up, could you all discuss any upcoming lease requirements that you might have at Alpine High as you slowdown activity in the play?
John Christmann: Yes, I mean that’s one of the big things where you've kind of challenged the team to do that is work through a plan that helped to determine what acreage we want to maintain for optionality purposes. So, that’s the process we’re working through, and we will be very deliberate and work through what it is, we think we have to maintain for optionality in the future.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with KeyBanc.
Leo Mariani: Just wanted to follow up a little bit there on Alpine High, obviously, you guys are kind of cutting back activity, but still looks like you have a pretty nice growth ramp here into fourth quarter. Just kind of wanted to get a sense with sort of 2 rigs out there in '20, how should we think about Alpine High production? Obviously, you've got significant production there. I mean is that's something that can kind of be maintained kind of at sort of year-end '19 levels? Or would you start to see some declines there with a couple of rigs?
John Christmann: Well, we’ll come back in February with the, when we have better view exactly what the plans is going to look like. But I do know we deferred some completions in early 2020 and we got some docs. So, it’s not going to drop massively, but we’ll come back with the shape for the curve next year that’s comments through with the activity level that we’ll go forward with.
Leo Mariani: And I guess, obviously, there's significant infrastructure there and clearly we'll get, I guess, another gas pipeline and Permian Highway coming sometime in early '21. I mean, I guess, what type of kind of future gas and NGL prices do you guys kind of want to see to where you may harvest kind of more of that resource? Any color on that would be helpful.
John Christmann: Yes. Thank you, just step back late 2018, we went in the more what I called the development stage and as Dave mentioned in prepared remarks we initiated pad drilling on four multi-well pads. Concurrently this spring we had a natural gas and NGL price is really materially lower and that happen as we started to bring on some of the infrastructure. So we’ve got the pads to evaluate and we’ll just come back with that view as well.
Leo Mariani: And I guess, just lastly on Egypt. Certainly, I noticed that your gross liquids volumes primarily on the oil side in the third quarter were kind of down versus 2Q kind of roughly 9% on my math here. Just wanted to get a sense if there was anything anomalous going on in 3Q on the gross oil volumes in Egypt that may have driven that reduction?
Dave Pursell: Yes, this is Dave Pursell, really what drove that were declines in Qasr and Berenice.
Leo Mariani: Okay.
Dave Pursell: Remember those -- just for some color, those fields have been producing for a wild now and it held much better than anticipated. So, we’re expecting declines at some point and we saw here in the third quarter.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities.
Richard Tullis: Just a couple of more on the Alpine High, John, could you talk a little bit about reserve write-downs that you took in the quarter related to the lower commodity pricing?
Dave Pursell: Yes. This is Dave Pursell. So, we’ll -- there’ll be more color at the end of the year in the K and there maybe some commentary in the Q, but what you see any price revision was primarily on gas and NGLs in the Permian Basin. There were very modest or performance vision, so the price revision were due to low basin gas and NGL prices and primarily focusing on Permian Basin.
Richard Tullis: And Dave, do you expect any additional year end write-downs in addition to what you referenced in the 3Q?
Dave Pursell: Yes. I think, if you -- yes, it’s a good question. If you look at the trailing four quarter pricing, we’re still benefiting somewhat a high fourth quarter 2018 price. So, as we roll forward and if you look at the future prices for the fourth quarter of 2019, we lose the benefit of the one high quarter that’s in the averaging right now. So, if the forward prices hold we would envision there would be some additional price revision in the fourth quarter. Say again still so hard to quantify those to get the actual in, but that’s kind of where we see it now.
Richard Tullis: That’s helpful. Thank you. And just my last question also related to Alpine High. Do you have any sort of minimum volume commitments with Altus that you have to maintain?
Dave Pursell: No, acreage dedication.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup.
Scott Gruber: So circling back on the CapEx split between U.S. and international, just back of the envelope here, it appears that the 4Q shift will see the U.S. international split move towards 65:35 based upon the updated annual guide for 2019. Is that broadly how we should think about the split in 2020, overall, would yield the modest spending growth abroad, is that how we should think about it?
John Christmann: I mean what I would say, I hate that, you just look at the one quarter, right, because things move around. But I would say in general, our CapEx is going to come down as we set. You’re going to see last rich gas drilling at Alpine High and you’re liable to see pretty flat pace in the North Sea compared to where we are, and we actually have some exploration wells. So that number might come down a little bit. Egypt should be flat to slightly and our oil projects in the U.S. are going to be a little higher as well. So, we’ll give you more color in February when we come out with our final 2020 plans.
Scott Gruber: And then just on the UK given the production momentum heading into next year, what are you guys looking at in terms of production over the full course of 2020? Can you generate some growth from the UK next year?
John Christmann: Once, again, we’ll hold off on the 20s specifics until we come out with the plan, but we’re very excited about the program. They’ve done a tremendous job this year at Garten 2, absolutely exceeded our expectations. We’ve got an entire fault block there that looks just fantastic that we had upside at the Storr well. So, we’ve got some big things coming on and it sets up as Dave said in his prepared remarks, set ups some additional drilling at Garten in the future. So, the shape of the curve going into 2020 is going to have a lot of momentum for the North Sea.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy
Ryan Todd: Maybe a follow-up question on Alpine High and Altus in particular, I mean, given the reduction activity at Alpine High, I know you have MVC. But how do you think about the go forward options at Altus longer-term in terms of future capital to spend on the G&P side, potential options to address the value and/or structure of the entity?
John Christmann: Ryan, I’ll ask you it's not too bigger than inconvenient so just hop on the Altus call this afternoon at 1 o'clock, and we'll let Clay and team there handle all of those questions directly.
Ryan Todd: Maybe one follow-up on Egypt, I mean, you've mentioned the possibility to generate long-term growth as opposed to just holding volumes flat in the region. I mean, what would you need to see the move in that direction? Would you need to see continue the exploration success? Have seen enough already? And is there anything else that would dictate kind of how aggressive you would or could be there?
John Christmann: No, I mean, that's we got very large position, right; and we’ve got a very large base, I think the technology that we’re applying the new acreage we picked up with the new 3D puts us in a position for pretty interesting looking inventory. And I think it's going to be more driven off the inventory and the opportunity set than anything.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays.
Jeanine Wai: Just wanted to follow up on some of the Egypt questions, I make sure I got some of your remarks correct. So, in your prepared you've indicated that you’re building and enhancing drilling inventory there. And so, can you provide us with an update on what the current capital efficiency looks like because that might have changed over the past couple of years as you're spending below maintenance? And then, how productive the first call and incremental capital sounds like, because it seems like there could be some exploration? I know you said there is already some gas facility there, but not sure what’s there on the oil side in order for you to increase production?
John Christmann: Yes, Jeanine, I thank if you look at Egypt, I don’t think we’ve been under investing. So, that’s the first thing I’d say, I think we’ve been investing in appropriate pace. We had a very large discovery in Qasr, many, many years ago, which is pretty unique. And so, if you take that out and look at the portfolio, we’ve been on a really good pace. You look at the Ptah and Berenice discoveries, we had in late 2014 early 2015; things have been going quite strong. So, we’ve got a big footprint. We’ve been there a long time. We spread out over a very, very large area. And my point on the other tie ends is, we just have a lot of capacity there for more gas yields. And so, I think things are going quite well and we do see the potential to improve our productivity with the new inventory.
Jeanine Wai: My second question is on the Alpine High, in terms of giving away some Alpine High CapEx to other early play. At what commodity prices do you think that Alpine High can beat your capital? And I guess what we’re thinking is just that, you’re takeaway contracts specifically for Alpine High for NGLs and crude, those are acreage dedications so you have a ton of flexibility there. The gas takeaway I believe has that MVCs, but I’m pretty sure that you wouldn’t have an issue arbing those out. So, just trying to really figure out kind of what the push and pull is on CapEx allocation to that play?
John Christmann: I mean it's purely going to be forward look at the incremental economics.
Operator: Our final question will come from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.
Michael Hall: Thanks. A lot of been address, I guess maybe going back to Suriname. Now, you’ve got the Mako Well location out there. Is there any additional color you can provide as to why this was the first of the test of the nine wells you’ve permitted and any additional color on the thought process there?
John Christmann: Well, I mean it’s first of all in the block, right. So -- and it’s a well that we like, some of the prospect there its ability to test two of them and that’s why we chose it.
Michael Hall: And were there any risks in the other wells that you were mitigating with the selection of this well?
John Christmann: With the exploration and your first well in, it’s a process right. So, there is -- since it has the word exploration by, there's always risks that you're assessing and you learn from. And so, but this was the order of the first well we thought we should drill, and from there, we got numerous options to go. So, but there is -- as we said all along, there are seven different play types. There are many, many significant very good looking prospects, so we just had to get started somewhere.
Michael Hall: And then I guess just to come back on the Alpine High economics side of thing, I think in the past you’ve talked about mid-$0.20 or 7 handle on propane as kind of the level to think about where Alpine High will compete for capital. Are those still fair levels to watch?
John Christmann: Michael, we’ll come back on that. I mean once again, we've got four pads that we’re evaluating, and it really is going to boil down to now that we have the infrastructure in place. It's more about the incremental economics relative to our other portfolio opportunities.
Operator: And with no further audio questions, I’ll hand the floor back to John Christmann for closing remarks.
John Christmann: So, thank you. In closing, Apache is taking significant steps to lower our cost structure and to further optimize our capital allocation. Our goal is to improve free cash flow yield inclusive of the dividend, increase returns, and continue our pace of modest oil growth. We have some very attractive exploration opportunities throughout the portfolio that make Apache a differential investment opportunity. Thank you and happy Halloween.
Operator: This does conclude today’s conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-01 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Natalia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.
Gary Clark: Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's second quarter financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by CEO and President, John Christmann. Tim Sullivan, Executive Vice President of Operations Support, will then provide additional operational color; and Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO will summarize our second quarter financial performance. Also available on the call to answer questions are Apache Executive Vice Presidents, Mark Meyer, Energy Technology, Data Analytics and Commercial Intelligence; and Dave Pursell, Planning, Reserves and Fundamentals. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 20 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our second quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations Web site at investor.apachecorp.com. On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our Web site. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt's tax barrels. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our Web site. And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will provide an overview of Apache's second quarter results, comment on our production outlook and capital investment program for the remainder of the year, outline our current position and initiatives in the Permian Basin, Egypt, North Sea, and offshore Suriname, and conclude with some thoughts on capital allocation in the context of the current macro environment. The second quarter Apache's total adjusted production exceeded guidance with upstream capital spending of just under $600 million. Through mid year, we have invested less than 50% of our four-year budget of $2.4 billion. We are focused on strict capital discipline which is achievable given our level loaded activity set and relatively stable operational pace over the last couple of years. Permian Basin oil volumes drove our guidance in the second quarter for a few reasons. Tim will provide more details. But in aggregate we brought online 15 fewer wells than anticipated and incurred a significant delay in initial production from several other wells. Most of these items are just timing related from which we will fully recover by yearend. Internationally and at Alpine High, volumes in the second quarter were in line with our adjusted production guidance. Construction and commissioning of Altus Midstream's first two cryogenic processing plants were on budget and ahead of schedule. The first cryo plant has already exceeded nameplate capacity. The second plant is fully in service and ramping inlet volumes. And the third plant is scheduled for startup around year end. For the remainder of 2019, capital will be at or below our second-half budget of $1.2 billion. With activity more heavily weighted toward completions, this should result in good production momentum as we exit 2019. We have revised our second-half Permian Basin production guidance to reflect the delays we experienced in the Midland and Delaware as well as projected third quarter gas deferrals at Alpine High. Our fourth quarter Alpine High production target of 100,000 BOE per day is unchanged from prior guidance. This is based on a plan to return all deferred production to sales by the beginning of October with the GCX pipeline startup. It also assumes that Altus Midstream's cryo units are operating in full ethane recovery mode. We will prioritize value over production volumes and depending on the prevailing gas and NGL prices may to choose to reject ethane at Alpine High, which would impact our reported fourth quarter volumes. Internationally, we continue to expect third and fourth quarter volumes to be in line with prior guidance. With that, I would like to offer some specific comments on our key operating areas of the Permian Basin, Egypt, and North Sea as well as offshore Suriname. In the Permian Basin, Apache has one of the industry's largest acreage footprints and a diverse inventory of opportunities. For more than two years now, we have been running a six to ten rig program focused on oil development in the Midland and Delaware basin, and a five to nine rig program focused on Alpine High. In the Midland and Delaware basins, we are in full development mode delivering highly productive top tier oil wells at very competitive cost. We have a large inventory at oil prone locations that continues to expand with ongoing improvements and understanding of the resource base. This position will support a higher base right count should we choose to add or reallocate capital from other areas. At Alpine High, we have a very large resource base, much of which has been advanced to development ready inventory. With that accomplished, Alpine High must now compete for capital with the rest of our Permian assets. In the short term, Alpine High economics were adversely impacted by very depressed gas pricing at Waha. In response, we are continuing to defer the majority of our lane [ph] gas and a portion of our rich gas production until the GCX pipeline enter service in late September. From a cash flow and returns perspective, it is far more viable to wait a few weeks and produce into an improved price environment. At current gas and NGL prices, some portions of Alpine High are less competitive than other opportunities in our portfolio. If this pricing situation does not improve, some capital will be re-allocated to areas with more leverage to oil price most likely elsewhere in the Permian Basin. Turning to Egypt, Apache is the largest acreage holder in the Western Desert and is the country's leading oil producer giving a strong leverage to Brent pricing with a substantial increase in our acreage position over the past two years and a 3 million acre broadband seismic acquisition program nearly two-thirds complete. We anticipate a significant refreshed inventory of oil focused opportunities. This should help increase capital efficiency and returns as we continue to generate a high level of free cash flow. Egypt provides tremendous long-term sustainable oil production potential. In the U.K., North Sea Apache has some of the industry's best assets and one of the lowest cost operations, production recently reached a two-year high driven by continued exploration success in the barrel area and a shallower oil decline rate in the Mature Forties Field resulting from a sharpened focus on water flow and activities. Annual capital investment has been less than $300 million and with strong leverage to Brent oil prices, the North Sea is consistently generating substantial free cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we will bring online another exploration discovery at store in the barrel area in a second development well at Garten. We have plenty of exploration running room in the North Sea with the ability to tie discoveries back relatively quickly and inexpensively to leverage existing infrastructure. In Suriname, we currently anticipate receiving the Nobel Sam Croft drillship during the second half of August and spudding our first exploration well on Block 58 in September. We have secured this rig for a one well commitment with an option on three additional wells. We believe that Block 58 offers tremendous potential and multiple wells across the block will likely be warranted for proper evaluation irrespective of the initial wells outcome. While we intend to drill the first well at 100% working interest, we have continued interest from potential partners. To summarize, our current portfolio Apache has an extensive inventory of high quality assets ranging from significant identified resource ready for short cycle development to large scale highly prospective exploration. This includes at scale in both conventional and unconventional resource covering the full spectrum of hydrocarbon potential from oil to liquids rich gas tilling gas. When we began 2019, the commodity price environment was volatile but planning based on a $50 to $55 WTI and a 250 to 280 Henry Hub for the long-term felt prudent, if not slightly conservative. Oil prices so far are delivering on that expectation. But gas prices are significantly weaker. Additionally, NGL prices took a material downturn in the second quarter and are now trading near historic lows around 35% of WTI. In this volatile commodity environment, a high quality diverse portfolio with the flexibility to redirect capital is a significant advantage. As we progressed our longer term planning process, we are closely monitoring macro commodity fundamentals and evaluating many capital allocation scenarios for 2020 and beyond under a number of different pricing decks. We look forward to sharing our preliminary thoughts on this in the coming months. In closing, our strategy for creating shareholder value is straightforward. Flex our capital allocation and leverage our portfolio commensurate with the prevailing commodity price environment live within cash flow at reasonable oil prices and generate free cash flow to return to investors, fund the capital program capable of delivering a sustainable combination of long-term returns with a moderate pace of growth, execute on our differential high impact conventional and unconventional exploration opportunity set. I'm confident Apache can deliver on this strategy given our diversified and well-balanced portfolio, high quality drilling inventory, relatively low Permian oil base decline rate, attractive exploration portfolio and continuous focus on improving capital productivity and efficiency. With that, I will turn the call over to Tim Sullivan who will provide some operational details on the quarter.
Tim Sullivan: Good morning. From an operational perspective, Apache's highlights for the second quarter 2019 include larger pads with longer laterals in the Southern Midland Basin, strong Barnett results at our Mont Blanc pad and Alpine High an oil discovery on one of our new concessions in Egypt and steady development work in the North Sea at store and garden. Please refer to our second quarter financial and operational supplement for drilling pad and well highlights across our portfolio. Company-wide adjusted production was down from the first quarter 2019 reflecting the sale of mid-Continent assets during the period and deferred production at Alpine High. Year-over-year production was roughly flat. In the second quarter, we drilled and completed 67 gross wells, 54 in the Permian Basin, 11 in Egypt and 2 in the North Sea. In the U.S. second quarter 2019 production totaled 264, 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As John mentioned, Permian Basin oil production was impacted by some one-off events or pads and wells are commencing production later than planned. We are trialing a new electric-powered frac fleet however, commissioning of the fleet took longer than expected and it arrived on our first location 30 days late impacting not only the initial pad but follow on pads as well. We have since fracked 11 wells on four different pads with this fleet operational efficiencies are improving and on a single well basis, we realized more than $250, 000 in diesel savings alone while reducing emissions an estimated 90%. Also in the Midland Basin an early sidetrack during drilling operations coupled with flow-back limitations on the pad delayed peak production nearly a month from the Black Dog pad, which includes 9 wells drilled with 2 mile laterals. This pad is now producing as expected. In the Delaware Basin, we drilled 5 wells at Dixie Land and have deferred the completions, while we remediate mechanical issues at two of the wells. We are working our completion schedule and expect to place these wells online later this year, but the precise timing is uncertain. The impact of these production delays has affected second quarter results and will linger into the third and fourth quarters. We expect to be caught up with all this year's plan completions by year-end and we anticipate fourth quarter oil production to come in between 100,000 and 105, 000 barrels per day compared to our prior guidance of 105,000 barrels per day. We are also benefiting from the start up of Altus Midstream, new cryogenic processing plants at Alpine High. Drilling and completion costs at Alpine High continue to improve on a cost per foot basis as we execute more development activity. Pad development continues to drive down costs into our projected range, drilling completing and equipping costs on one mile laterals are approaching $5.5 million per well. International adjusted production of 132,000 BOE per day came in as expected. In Egypt, we drilled our first lower Bahariya discovery and our new East Bahariya concession the well flowed at an initial test rate of 3900 barrels of oil per day. This success of a number of additional low cost short cycle drilling locations, we are also building inventory with our 3D seismic survey across 3 million acres in the Western Desert, where we have completed over 65% of the shoot. Turning to the North Sea third quarter production will be impacted by annual turnaround maintenance with production rebounding in the fourth quarter. The subsea tieback development at store remains on schedule for first production in the fourth quarter. We also expect to have a second producer at Garden drilled and completed by year-end. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.
Stephen Riney: Thank you, Tim. On today's call, I will briefly review second quarter financial results and a few updates to 2019 guidance. Discuss the impact of our recent asset sales, and our continuing debt management initiatives and update the status of our promise for returning capital to investors. As noted in the press release issued last night, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported a second quarter 2019 consolidated net loss of $360 million or $0.96 per diluted common share. These results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings, which are typically excluded by the investment community and they're published earnings estimates. On an after-tax basis, the most significant items include $220 million for asset impairments, most of which were associated with our recent asset sales, $114 million of evaluation allowance on deferred tax assets, and $59 million for a loss on extinguishment of debt. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $41 million or $0.11 per share. Upstream capital investment was less than $600 million for the second consecutive quarter, demonstrating our commitment to running a level-loaded disciplined capital program and meeting our full-year upstream budget of $2.4 billion. Capital spending in the third quarter will be biased slightly higher than the fourth quarter due primarily to P&A work in the Gulf of Mexico, and development spending on store in the North Sea. LOE per BOE for the quarter was above expectations, primarily due to higher salaries in Egypt driven by in-country inflation and increased diesel consumption in both Egypt and the North Sea. Looking ahead, we have increased our full-year LOE per BOE outlook to capture the impact of these higher cost trends and ongoing gas deferrals at Alpine High. Offsetting LOE costs, gathering, processing, and transportation costs were below guidance in the quarter. And our guidance for the full-year has been revised downward. This is primarily driven by the sale of assets. In May and in July, Apache completed the sale of midcontinent assets in two separate transactions, resulting in $560 million of net cash proceeds after typical closing adjustments. A portion of these proceeds was used to retire $150 million of bonds that matured in early July. During the second quarter, we refinanced $546 million of debt maturing over the next five years to enhance near-term liquidity. We also refinanced $386 million of higher coupon debt of various maturities to lower our cost of borrowing. Combined with the debt paydown the net result of these actions is that we reduced overall leverage and extended our debt maturity profile, significantly reducing near-term debt maturities. In February, we announced our intention to return at least 50% of our incremental cash generation to investors before any increases to planned capital activity. In keeping with this commitment, we began returning incremental cash to investors with the debt paydown in July. In the meantime, our 2019 planned capital activity has not changed, and we have no plans to do so. While oil price and sale proceeds helped create capacity for further capital return to investors, the combination of historically weak gas prices in the Permian, a result in production deferrals, and now extremely weak NGL prices have more than offset the oil price benefit. We will monitor anticipated 2019 cash flows and will continue to prioritize returns to investors over increasing capital spend. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Michael Scialla with Stifel.
Michael Scialla: Hey, good morning, guys. John, you mentioned…
John Christmann: Good morning, Mike.
Michael Scialla: You mentioned Alpine High is going to have to compete with the rest of the portfolio with lower than expected NGL and gas prices. Just wondering what your preliminary thoughts are for next year in terms of the midstream, do you go ahead with any additional cryo plants there or how you're thinking about 2020 at this point for Alpine High?
John Christmann: Well, I mean if you look at where we were when we reported this year's plan we had an oil price of $53, and gas was at $2.80, and propane and ethane were at high levels, $0.75 and $0.30. So the gas and the ethane and propane have come down significantly. I think with where we sit today, Mike, and Altus will have their call at 1:00 o'clock. But with where we are today with cryo, two coming on now and three coming on in the fourth quarter, we're in pretty darn good shape on that front. So I think they'll be in a good position to have the infrastructure in place we would need for the capital we look at.
Michael Scialla: And then I wanted to see if you had any updated thoughts on the offset well at Haimara discovery and Suriname, and any thoughts there on any additional color you can…
John Christmann: Well, yes, as far as Suriname, I mean we're obviously anxious. Looks like we're going to get the rig here in a couple of weeks, kind of mid to late August, so it's coming, and we should spot our first well in September. Obviously, from the public data we've analyzed everything we can. We've got 2D data and have looked very closely at all the activity that's going on next door, and we've kind of rolled that in. We have the benefit of a very state-of-the-art 3D with very good resolution. So we've worked our block very, very hard and in detail, and been doing it for multiple years. So we're obviously anxious. If you look at the Block 58 it's a very large block, it's 1.44 million acres today. We have planned to start our program at 100%, and but there is continued interest in the blocks, I will say that. But when we look at it we have not given specifics on where the location will be. I will tell you we have a number of wells permitted. We have a pretty good idea where it's going, obviously with us about to get the rig, but there's seven play types, there's over 50 large prospects, and there's a pretty good chance that you'll see us lining up some of those targets with where we will choose to drill the early wells. I will tell you, it's going to take multiple wells in this block to fully evaluate it.
Michael Scialla: Very good. Thanks, John.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.
John Freeman: Hi, guys.
John Christmann: Hi, John.
John Freeman: So sort of following up a little bit on Mike's question, when we look at sort of the really strong margins that you all are getting internationally, and I guess if gas prices and NGL prices sort of remain depressed, I guess just sort of how you're thinking about potentially increasing possibly the allocation of capital that goes international sort of on a go-forward basis now that you're basically saying that Alpine High will have to start competing more on a return basis going forward?
John Christmann: Well, we have a very elaborate dynamic planning process, and it's turned into kind of a 365-day-a-year process. And we're in the throes of that now. And when we look at the portfolio I think the first thing I'll say is we have a very diverse portfolio with many investment options, and none of those have been funding it full capacity over the last couple of years. So we've got a lot of opportunity. Secondly, I would say is that we have a very deep understanding of our asset base, which gives us the ability to make sure we're making those right calls on where we're going to put that capital. And the big thing is we're going to allocate capital to drive long-term value. So when you look at where we sit today there are numerous places where we have been under investing where we have leveraged oil. Obviously our Midland and Delaware oil positions are two places. We've had a great track record of results there. Those are areas we could go to. When you look at Egypt, we're in the middle of working through the big 3D shoot, and so we're kind of anxious to see what comes out of that shoot, but I can tell you the early returns look very promising. So there are places we can do that as well. There are other oil zones up at Alpine High. And we've got some other places in the portfolio as well. So we have an abundance of deep places where we can put capital, and we'll work through that under normal course and come back later in the year on our plans as we see going forward.
John Freeman: That's great. And then just my follow-up question, you've done a great job on the CapEx front, and obviously are tracking below what would have been expected so far this year. And I guess when you sort of talk about anticipate spending at or below the $2.4 billion budget, I just want to make sure I'm sort of on the same page as the way you're thinking about it. So is it that you're sort of being conservative and you want to wait to see another quarter play out to make sure things still track the way they have so far this year, or is it possible that some of the savings that you're generating you're considering maybe reallocating, reinvesting back somewhere across the portfolio?
John Christmann: Well, there's a lot of factors that come into play. I'll say number one, we took a frac holiday Q1. Secondly, when we brought in our clean fleet, it was a lot -- 30 days late on the commissioning. So we actually are kind of back in loaded in the Permian and we are going to bring on, I think, 60% of our wells in the back half of the year in the Permian. So that's a little bit of a John. Secondly, we've got the Suriname oil out there that is moved. We've always thought most would be third quarter and fourth quarter span, but it's shifted a little bit, so some of it's timing. There are areas where we're seeing it Alpine High, our well costs come down. And so, we're seeing some areas that are helping us a little bit, but there's just a lot of factors that kind of leave us in that position. I think the point to underscore though, is you will not see us increase the activity set. And we feel very confident that we can deliver that activity set for the $2.4 billion or potentially less.
John Freeman: Thanks, John, I appreciate the answers.
John Christmann: You bet.
Operator: So our next question is on the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles Meade: Good morning, John to you and your team.
John Christmann: Good morning Charles.
Charles Meade: Hey, I want to just pick up where you just left off there. Just a quick question, in Suriname, in answering the last question, you said the Suriname well, at least I think I heard you say that. But either guys are getting this rig in next couple of weeks for the September, you're going to have time on the calendar to drill at least one more well, so. So how many wells are in your plan or in that -- in the capital budget as it exists right now?
John Christmann: Well, in the 2.4, we had budgeted one well a 100%. So we have a one well commitment with the rig, we have an option for three additional wells. And, realistically, we've got one in the budget. And, that's where I'll leave that.
Charles Meade: Okay, got it. Thank you. And then John, going up back to Alpine High, wondering if you could talk us through the process of two things, what is the -- what's the sequence? And what's it going to look like for you guys? And what are you going to be focused on as that Gulf Coast Express comes on beginning of October, maybe mid of September? And how is that going to interact with your decision to recover or reject ethane?
John Christmann: Well, I mean, obviously, we have to watch the dynamics. I mean, we think GCX coming online is a big event for the basin, it's a big event for us and a big event for Alpine High, is we have a quarter of the volume on the 2 Bcf over from like 550 of the 2 Bcf a day is going to move. So, for us, first thing is we want to see what happens to differentials. We want to see the impact that that might have or the follow-through on the NGO prices. So we will be watching that very carefully. We want to make sure we're looking out and looking at longer-term views on things because you can't be shifting capital around need your short-term decisions, but -- so we're going to take a very methodical and deliberate approach. But we'll be cognizant of how those things, kind of play out over the longer-term and what it looks like they're going to do will dictate, how we run some of our capital programs. And we've got the flexibility with the inventory to plan for some multiple scenarios. And so, we'll be ready to go with multiple scenarios. And we'll kind of watch and see how that all unfolds. I think it's going to be good for the Basin. Dave, is there anything you want to add?
Dave Pursell: No. John, the one thing I'd add is on the ethane rejection side. The crowds are up and running. They've operationally flexed them for full rejection and full extract, ethane extraction mode. And so, we'll have the operational flexibility to react at the field to Waha pricing and Waha gas and Gulf Coast NGO prices. So, John is right, we're going to make long-term capital decisions based on long-term views but we will be able to react on a relatively short basis on the -- with the cryo operations.
Charles Meade: Thank you. That's helpful, Dave and John. Thank you.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is on the line of Gail Nicholson with Stephens.
Gail Nicholson: Good morning, everybody. Question on the North Sea with the final agreement in barrel, can you talk about the potential opportunity set that there and what you guys are looking for with that first well in the fourth quarter?
John Christmann: Well, I mean. Again, we're excited about the North Sea. We've done a really good job over the last few years of being able to generate strong free cash flow from our operations, or you've seen the track record, with calendar and then Garten in terms of tie backs to the infrastructure. You know, what we've been able to do is leverage some of the little further out acreage; we've got a nice tertiary play there. And, you know, we had 100% of that acreage. And so, we are not able to bring a partner in, and we'll get a couple wells carried that I think are, are upside kind of to our picture, but we're very excited about there's been some tertiary discoveries, and we've got some very nice looking prospects that will be able to get drilled as you move into later this year, and then the next year.
Gail Nicholson: Great. And then, one for Steve a housekeeping question. How much PNA CapEx is in 3Q for Gham [Ph]?
Stephen Riney: Yes, there's Gail. I don't remember the exact number, but it's in. I think it's in the $50 million to $100 million range. It's probably a little bit less than that $50, around $50 million, Gail.
Gail Nicholson: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.
Robert Brackett: Hey, good morning. I had a question on the line field process at Gulf Coast Express. I understand we're undergoing line field now. Is that a benefit to you guys in terms of either volume or price?
John Christmann: Bob? I would just say yes.
Robert Brackett: Okay. Second question, then the September spot in Suriname or that -- is that a 40 day well?
John Christmann: Well, it could be as short probably as 30. Or, we kind of looked at 30 to 60. But we'll see.
Robert Brackett: Okay, so 30 to 60 days. And would you plan to announce results immediately on TV, or is that something you'd wait for a conference call to announce?
John Christmann: We just have to see. So I mean, it's -- there's -- there will be multiple targets? And I'll just leave it -- it will kind of play that by year.
Robert Brackett: And by multiple targets, does that mean, you think you could hit perhaps Miocene and Cretaceous reservoirs with a single well born or maybe a sidetrack?
John Christmann: I won't get into as much detail but I think we will be able to stack several of our objective plays.
Robert Brackett: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Douglas Leggate: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, John.
John Christmann: Good morning, Doug.
Douglas Leggate: John. I wonder if I can just take a twofer. If you don't mind, first of all on Alpine High in Midland, can you -- philosophically, it sounds like you're kind of rationalizing a pivot towards the more oil part of the basin. If that's the case, can you touch on the inventory that you have in the middle inside? And also the trajectory then for Alpine High would the objective then be to basically fill the cryo funds and hold it flat after that or what are you thinking about it?
John Christmann: Well, I mean, I think what you're -- what we're going to do is basically allocate capital based on how we see the commodity price dictate. And then, we've got the luxury to do that, we're at a point today at Alpine High, where we now have that luxury, we hold a lot of the acreage, it won't take a lot of drilling to hold the acreage that we view is very perspective for really rich gas NGO and gas production. And so, we're at a point today where we can let the economics and leverage our portfolio. So there's a couple different scenarios. I think the cryo is recognizing that we own 79% of Altus. And factoring that in is something we will factor into our calculus of how we look at the value proposition there with those -- with prices. As far as the depth of inventory in the Midland Basin, we feel very good about that, we've been predominantly focused, and we've run more rigs than we run at a day in three areas in the Midland Basin Powell, Wildfire and Azalea. And in there we've drilled somewhere between 20% and 30% of the locations that we see there. We are now adding more landing zones. But you got to understand that that's really only about 20% of our acreage footprint. And you look at the other areas, we've gone out and drill some test wells, Benedum and Hartgrove fantastic results. So we've got a really deep inventory in the Midland Basin. We've been focused on getting to pad development. We went through a period, where we did a lot of testing and slowed down and make sure we get spacing, right, understood gas-oil ratios, where we could move forward and you're seeing the results of those programs. And so, we have a lot of inventory there that is sitting - ready to drill and we just kind of weigh that with the integrated economics in the price deck of how we look at the options in our portfolio.
Douglas Leggate: I appreciate the full answer. My follow-up is on, obviously is on [indiscernible] I just wonder if it sort of run something past get your sense of the - so it seems to me that when we think about the probability of geological success of the Exxon Haimara has basically de-risked some of the parameters that we contributed, particularly hydrocarbon system obviously, how do you guys think about the PG, the probability of geological success on the wells that you're going to drill and if that's the case, can you confirm or could you maybe speak to -- it seem to me that it wouldn't make a lot of sense at this point to drill in the immediate offset well behind Haimara. So, are you going to drill in offshore or is it's a completely independent prospect? And I'll leave it there, thanks.
John Christmann: Well, I mean, first of all, it is exploration. So if I try to pin my guys down there. I'll tell you, you're no better than one in four and that's just because it's exploration. Now that being said, they've moved into a phase where they're better than exploration right next door to us and you have a discovery on the International Water boundaries. So clearly that does two things. It proves that there are hydrocarbons in the system. When we look at the views across by kind of stitching together the 2D and the 3D data, you'll find that the geologic setting is not changing much, but you know, it's exploration. So I'm not going to come out and tell you that it's any higher than that at this point. But we're obviously very anxious to get started. And we're very comfortable going forward at 100% with our interest.
Douglas Leggate: John, just to be clear, any of the four wells potentially planned direct offsets to higher MRO?
John Christmann: We have multiple wells permitted, Doug. And we'll - I'll just say, we'll play them as we go and as we learn.
Douglas Leggate: Awesome, thanks for the answers.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.
Scott Hanold: Yes, thanks. I was curious, you know now that I guess the cryo plant I, it has been up and running for a bit and the number two is obviously getting some traction here. Do you have a sense that you know what -- if you were normalized kind of commodity prices like, where do you all think sort of the mix of that NGL basket would be in terms of products?
Dave Pursell: Yes, this is Dave Pursell. Right now, these are the technology used in the cryos, we're removing almost 100% of the ethane. So as a result, if you compare it to an average NGL barrel, this will be a little more heavily weighted to ethane and propane. We're still lining amount - we would anticipate, as we move forward. We'll get a richer gas stream kind of the inlet of the cryos and so, ultimately the NGL barrel will look a little closer to what the traditional Midland barrel looks like with maybe a tad more ethane in it.
Scott Hanold: Okay, so that's sort of the next batch command, you'll get a better sense of that. Okay and then just to stand…
John Christmann: One other thing there too Scott, it's going to change based on the formation. We're into a lot of what we're flowing through there right now is, and as you get into the bottom edge, it's going to get a little heavier as well, but so there is, a lot of dynamics that will, dictate that going forward.
Scott Hanold: Right, and that's all part of the capital allocation process for the future. All right, okay and so then if you look at what do - are some of those product prices, need to do to make Alpine High say compete to say your standard oily Midland. Well, I mean how much, how far off? Are we forward to being more competitive today?
John Christmann: Well, I mean, where we started this year, when we were kind of thinking 53 oil and 280 gas and we have $0.75 on propane $0.30 on ethane. We like the mix where we have. So, we're obviously not there today with where the NGLs have come down and gas specifically. So, clearly that's going to be somewhere between where we were and where we are today.
Scott Hanold: Okay, well that's a good benchmark to give us a sense of where it shifts. I appreciate that, thanks.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer: Thank you. Good morning.
John Christmann: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Singer: Just one question on our end, which is with regards to Egypt, you talked about this new discovery on the Bahia area. Can you just add some greater color, on how we should think about the resource potential? How that competes in the portfolio and any impact that could have to either capital investment or growth in Egypt?
John Christmann: Well, I mean if you step back and look. Egypt has got some of the highest returns in our portfolio. So it competes very, very well. We are shooting a large area in the nice thing about Egypt is, it's stack pays. But, they're conventional rock and so you can get a 3,000 or 4,000 barrel a day IP from a vertical well. It's going to cost you $2 million to $3 million. So it's tax out very, very nicely in the portfolio, and I think with the new seismic. If you look back over the last two years, we really kept Egypt flat with two discoveries at Peter and Bear Nice and just drilling offset wells there. So it doesn't take a lot to have a real impact on us and we're obviously anxious to get 3-D. The 3-D back, we think our capital productivity, can improve is the quality of the prospects goes up and we love the leveraged Egypt.
Brian Singer: I mean, I know you manage to cash flow and not the production mix, but as the wet gas picks up in Alpine High is there,-- any interest in kind of offsetting that with greater investments in either Egypt or the North Sea both to improve cash flow and mix?
John Christmann: I mean, we will look as we talked about, as I talked about answering some of their Rick questions. We'll look at the whole portfolio and we'll balance that and look at where you can move short term. It's easier to move into probably our Midland Delaware Basin. But we'll, clearly that will be factored into our capital. We love the Brent price, we love the Brent price exposure in the cash flow or on the international side.
Brian Singer: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of David Deckelbaum with the Cowen.
David Deckelbaum: Good morning, John and team. Thanks for taking my questions.
John Christmann: Yes
David Deckelbaum: I just wanted to follow-up on some of the discussion around your sensitivities next year and you commented on the NGL prices at Alpine High and gas prices. I guess with TCX coming online and they have to be a day that, you have on there? I guess how do you think about the asset, in terms of minimum activity that you'd be willing to pursue and may be considering the asset as a marketing asset near term to take advantage of that spread and I guess how wide would that spreads have to be for you to us this kind of treated as something where you would just benefit from the marketing margins for the time being?
John Christmann: Well, I mean I think that the thing you look at number one Alpine High. We like the asset, it's a large resources, we've proven there is tremendous rich gas potential. We now have a lot of the infrastructure in place that we need. And quite frankly, we hold a lot of the acreage that is important to us. So from our perspective, we're in a position where, we can continue to high grade acreage and maintain that footprint and keep the optionality. I think as GTx comes on line, we've been waiting for that, I think it's a big event for the gas help here that's kind of why we've elected to curtail some pads, that we're bringing on and wait until it does come online because, there were such a short time away from seeing some increased cash flow. So it's an asset that, we will look to leverage and try to maximize but the important thing is, we have a portfolio. When we only have limited capital, we can put in. So we have to balance that, in regard with our other assets.
David Deckelbaum: Got it. Thank you, guys. And you were successful in the mid-count asset sale, anything else in the hopper these days that you guys are looking at selling?
John Christmann: Not anything that I would call major that we'd have out there, but we're always looking at the portfolio, always looking to trim if there's things we're not going to invest in, if there is areas that others would put, what we would view as good value on our premium value. We're not afraid to turn things loose.
David Deckelbaum: Thanks for the color, guys.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.
Arun Jayaram: Yes, good morning. Perhaps for Steve, I was wondering Steve, how you think your gas and NGL realizations will trend call it relative to benchmarks post the startup of GTx in the Permian of corporate wide.
Dave Pursell: This is David Pursell, Arun. Once GTx starts out, it would be our anticipation that Waha starts to trade in a more normal position relative to Gulf Coast less transportation. So I think our Permian and we think that will normalize some of the other hubs in the basin. So, you're likely going to see the Permian Basin realizations track in line with the Gulf Coast benchmarks less transportation. Steve, would you add anything to that.
Stephen Riney: Yes, the only thing I would add, David, is that there are some, significant events in terms of increased source or new sources of demand both for gas and for NGLs and for export capacity of NGLs coming online later this year. That would certainly potentially have some impact on pricing both on the Gulf Coast in back to Waha and back to the Permian Basin as well.
Arun Jayaram: Okay. And my follow-up is, you guys announced kind of an agreement which near on an LNG type pricing structure. I think, is in the beginning, I'm wondering if you could maybe shed some light on that and talk about maybe some of the longer term implications from that?
Dave Pursell: Yes, we're probably not going to shed a whole lot of details on that, but basically its structure. So first of all, it's 140 million a day, 140 million cubic feet a day. So, it's not a significant amount of volume that, we're producing and gas that's priced based on that. But it was, it's consistent with what we've always been talking about around Alpine High in the Permian Basin more generally and that is we want, to get a diversified portfolio if you will marketing based sources of realized price for the gas coming out of the Permian Basin and particularly Alpine High. And that's 140 million a day that gives us some flexibility in accessing various LNG markets around the world and getting netback from realized prices at landing points.
Arun Jayaram: Okay. Any details, just on the mechanism just trying to understand maybe the financial impact on that 140 million a day?
Dave Pursell: The mechanism is it's a relatively simple one. We have flexibility as to where the product goes in terms of pricing and it's a net-back based on tolling arrangements and shipping costs.
Arun Jayaram: Okay, fair enough thanks.
Operator: Your final question is from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy.
Michael Hall: Thanks, good morning or good afternoon. Yes, I was just curious what the base case assumption; our thought process is on extending the rig to drill to follow-up wells in Suriname at this point? Well, you guys go ahead and drill those three wells. Is that kind of the base thought, or is that dependent on whether or not you secure JV partner in the area.
John Christmann: It's purely an option, Michael, and all we've said is we're committed to want to, we have the option to take the rig and drill 3 more and that the block is going to be going to need additional wells.
Michael Hall: And if you were to extend it and take and go kind of heads up on that on your own, is that - how would that kind of fall in the pecking order in 2020 in terms of capital allocation given that it's - there is no clear - commodity linkage yet.
John Christmann: I'll just say it would be exploration dollars with material upside and I'll leave it there.
Michael Hall: All right, fair enough. Thanks guys.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to John for closing remarks.
John Christmann: So first, I want to end on a -- just a couple of points, approximately 60% of our planned 2019 Permian oil weighted wells will come online in the second-half of the year, giving us confidence in our year-end oil production exit rate. Second, our 2019 upstream capital spending is on track and will be at or below $2.4 billion. Next year's capital plan, assuming current strip around these levels will be $2.4 billion or more likely less. And lastly we are closely monitoring oil, NGL and natural gas fundamentals and we'll allocate capital within our portfolio in response to the longer-term price signals. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today's earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-02 11:00:00) =====

Tim Sullivan, Executive Vice President of Operations Support, will then provide additional operational color; and Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO will summarize our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance. Also available on the call to answer questions are Apache Executive Vice Presidents, Mark Meyer, Energy Technology, Data Analytics and Commercial Intelligence; and Dave Pursell, Planning, Reserves and Fundamentals. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 25 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our first quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt's tax barrels. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will provide an overview of Apache's first quarter results, discuss our production outlook and comment on our first exploration well in Suriname, review our upstream capital budget and Apache’s commitment to return incremental cash flow to investors and highlight our progress on non-core asset sales. Apache had an excellent first quarter in terms execution, well performance and delivery against our production and capital guidance. We exceeded our U.S. production target, my 5,000 BOEs per day and our international target by 7,000 BOEs per day, on a capital budget of less than $600 million. In the Permian basin, we maintained oil production near fourth quarter levels despite placing one of our two completion crews on a frac holiday for the entire first quarter. At Alpine High, where we also had a relatively low number of completions, production was up significantly from the fourth quarter and was in line with our guidance of 70,000 BOEs per day. Overall, we delivered a 5% sequential quarterly increase in Permian basin volumes. This is an impressive accomplishment given that we placed only 39 wells online in the first quarter compared to 60 wells during the fourth quarter. Strong operational execution and well performance coupled with minimal facilities downtime drove these results. International production was up 6% compared to the fourth quarter. In the North Sea, we benefited from strong early production rates from two wells at Gartner and Callater. A continuation of good results from our revamped Waterford program in the Forties field and high facilities uptime across our operations. In Egypt, gross production was down slightly in the quarter but adjusted production net to Apache was up primarily due to the timing of cost recovery around year end. Looking ahead, second quarter Permian oil production is projected to be down slightly due to completions timing with growth anticipated in the back half of the year is the number of completions increases significantly. At Alpine High production volumes will be impacted in the second quarter by the voluntary gas deferrals we discussed in our press release last week. I would note however, that temporary deferral of this production is expected to improve our short-term net cash flow. Construction of Altus Midstream’s first two cryogenic plants is proceeding ahead of schedule with the first plant currently commissioning and expected to flow gas this month. The second plant is expected to be fully in service during July and the third plant remains on schedule for the fourth quarter. By year-end, Altus will have a total 600 million cubic feet of nameplate rich gas processing capacity, capable of producing more than 60,000 barrels of NGLs per day. Kinder Morgan's GCX pipeline is also expected to be in service beginning in October, which will give Apache access to Gulf Coast pricing on 550 million cubic feet per day of gas from the Permian. These processing and transportation catalysts will drive a significant uplift and Alpine High liquids production revenue and cash flow on which Steve will provide more detail in a few minutes. On the international side, production will decrease in the second quarter as planned. The North Sea will experience natural declines from high production wells at Gartner and Callater while only one new well is being brought online during the quarter. In Egypt, we expect gross oil production to increase as we ramp up activity and our new East Bahariya concession. However, the impact of higher oil prices on our production sharing contracts coupled with natural gas production declines will result in lower volumes net to Apache. Looking out to the end of the year, our projected growth rate guidance from fourth quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2019 is unchanged. We continue to expect 6% to 10% growth on a total company adjusted basis consisting of 12% to 16% growth in the U.S. and a 2% to 4% decline internationally. Permian oil production is still expected to grow 5%. In Suriname, we have contracted the drillship and continue to anticipate spreading the first well on Block 58 in Suriname around mid-year. The Noble Sam Croft, which is working in the Gulf of Mexico will deploy to Suriname upon completion of its current assignment. We have secured this drillship for a one well commitment and have an option on three additional wells. While Apache is preparing to drill the first well on block 58 at 100%, we have received and are evaluating numerous proposals from potential partners. Turning now to CapEx. Our first quarter upstream capital investment was below guidance and was down 27% from fourth quarter levels. We began preparing for an activity reduction back in November, which was critical to enabling such a material change in our activity pace in less than one quarter. As planned, our second quarter CapEx will increase slightly from the first quarter as a result of increased completion spending in the Permian associated with the return of our second frac crew in the Midland basin and the timing of large pad completions of Alpine High. The timing of exploration spending mostly on Suriname, but also related to some activities in the lower 48 and lease payments at Alpine High where we are exercising some extension options due to the slower drilling activity. Despite some inflationary headwinds related to the rise in oil prices. We remain on track to deliver our 2019 planned activities set for $2.4 billion. We were experiencing cost increases in labor, trucking, fuel and chemicals, but have thus far been able to offset these through efficiency gains. We previously stated Apache's commitment to returning at least 50% of our incremental cash generation from all sources to investors before increasing our planned activity set. In keeping with this commitment, our 2019 planned capital activity and budget remains unchanged and we will began returning incremental cash to investors in the coming months. This is of course in addition to our current regular dividend. Steve will elaborate further. With the success of our organic growth and exploration program, we find ourselves with some assets in the portfolio that we do not envision funding over the next several years. These assets will be more valuable in the hands of different owners. Accordingly, we recently entered into sales agreements totaling approximately $300 million, most of which is related to an exit of the SCOOP/STACK which will close in the second quarter. In summary, 2019 is progressing very well. Overall production was strong in the first quarter and we are demonstrating excellent capital discipline and cost control. The North Sea and Egypt continued to deliver robust free cash flow with their leverage to premium Brent crude prices and higher natural gas and NGL net backs. In the Permian, we are poised to deliver attractive oil growth in a substantial cash flow uplift at Alpine High in the second half of the year. We will also be advancing our differential exploration initiatives most notably in Suriname. In closing, Apache continues to deliver on the strategy we established four years ago, which is to fund the capital program, capable of delivering long-term returns and sustainable growth, live within cash flow at reasonable oil prices, and continue to return meaningful capital to shareholders. We can accomplish this due to our high quality drilling inventory and attractive exploration portfolio, relatively low base decline rate and continuous focus on improving capital productivity and efficiency. With that, I will turn the call over to Tim Sullivan who will provide some operational details on the quarter.
Timothy Sullivan: Good morning. My prepared remarks on this call will cover first quarter 2019 region highlights and a review of the excellent progress we are making at Alpine High on cost reduction initiatives and rich gas pad optimization. Operationally, we are off to a very good start with all regions performing well. Companywide adjusted production was up 4% from the fourth quarter 2018 and up 19% from the same period in the prior year. The Permian was the largest growth driver with production up 5% and 36% respectively over the same time period. As John noted, these results are particularly impressive giving our reduced activity during the quarter. Our well completions in the U.S. were down 35% from the fourth quarter, which was the result of timing and a frac holiday in the Permian Basin. We have recently added back a cleaner, cheaper natural gas field hydraulic frac fleet. In the Midland Basin where we continue to drill high productivity oil wells, our primary activity in this quarter was an 8-well Wolfcamp B pad at Powell and a 6-well Lower Spraberry pad at Wildfire. In the Delaware Basin, we completed and brought on line a 4-well Wolfcamp pad at Dixieland, and at Alpine High, we brought on line 17 wells with the primary focus on rich gas in the Northern Flank. In Egypt, as a result of our recently awarded concessions and our ongoing broadband seismic acquisition program, we have generated several hundred leads and prospects in both legacy and new concession areas. In the New East Bahariya concession, we brought on line three exploration wells that achieved the combined peak rate of nearly 4,500 barrels of oil per day and have cumed more than 125,000 barrels of oil. These are low cost, short-cycle wells that typically payout very quickly. We also continue to have exploration success on our legacy acreage. One notable well on our Seawall concession in the Faghur Basin achieved a 30-day average flow rate of 5,200 barrels of oil per day. In the Matruh Basin, our Tango North exploration well tested at a rate of 4,000 barrels of oil per day and will go on line around mid-year. We also had a very successful Q1 development drilling campaign in Egypt with 14 producers, nine of which have tested in excess of 1,000 BOE per day. As we continue our G&G work, we expect to identify and drill many low-cost high rate oil prospects throughout the Western Desert, such as the ones we drilled this quarter. Turning to the North Sea, we drilled our first development well at Storr, which was the site of our 2016 exploration discovery. This well encountered 232-feet of net pay in the Nansen and Eriksson formations similar to the results from the discovery well. As we explored deeper, this well also encountered an additional 84-feet of net pay in the Kahraman formation, which is the same sand that is highly productive at Callater. First production at Storr is expected late in the fourth quarter. At Alpine High we will reach a significant milestone this month to start up of Altus first cryogenic plant in the next two to three weeks. Before Steve walks you through the significant cash generation in margin uplift we will receive. I wanted to highlight the significant progress we have made with both costs and our rich gas optimization initiatives on the upstream side. Since Alpine High is delineation phase began in 2017, Apache has made steady efficiency gains, drilling costs per foot or down approximately 20% from 2017 through the end of the first quarter. Over the same time period, we realized that 30% reduction in completion costs per lateral foot. These costs improvements have come with only a modest increase in average lateral length. We expect to generate further efficiencies as lateral links increase over time and the average number of wells drilled per pad increases. Multiwell pad optimization has now begun at Alpine High. We are evaluating optimal pattern and spacing relationships within a section to recover larger volumes of hydrocarbons with fewer wells and less capital. As an example, we recently conducted spacing and pattern tests on two rich gas pads on the Northern Flank situated in adjacent sections. By adjusting the horizontal spacing between wells, the vertical location within target zones, and an improving our frac design. We are seeing cumulative recoveries from our 6-well Mont Blanc pad significantly outperform our 8-well Blackfoot pad. 6-wells producing from the Woodford A&B formations on the Mont Blanc pad achieved 150 days gross cumulative production of 10.5 Bcf of rich gas compared to 9.7 Bcf and the 8-well Blackfoot pad in the same Woodford A&B formations. In combination with cryogenic processing each pad was also have cube in excess of 800,000 barrels of NGLs. With 2 fewer wells, the Mont Blanc pad has not only outperform but has also realized cost savings of $12.7 million as a result of fewer well bores. Capital efficiency is vital to success in resource play development and the trends are certainly positive for Alpine High. We believe there are substantial additional cost savings to be realized through ongoing optimization initiatives which include longer laterals and larger pads. Apache has also made considerable upfront investments in water handling and reuse facilities at Alpine High, which will drive cost savings for many years to come. Our primary target formations, the Woodford and the Barnett produced very little institchu water, thereby eliminating the need to contract costly water handling trucks and salt water disposal services. We believe the Alpine High is well on its way to being the lowest cost, most efficient and most environmentally friendly rich gas play in the country. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.
Stephen Riney: Thank you, Tim. On today's call, I will review first quarter financial results, update the status of gas production deferrals at Alpine High. Provide a few guidance changes for 2019, highlight the cash generation capacity of our rich gas production at Alpine High following cryo startup later this month and GCX startup later this year and outline our current thinking around capital return to investors. As noted in the press release issued last night under generally accepted accounting principles. Apache reported first quarter of 2019 consolidated net loss of $47 million or $0.12 per diluted common share. These results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings, which are typically excluded by the investment community and their published earnings estimates. On an after tax basis the most significant items include a $35 million unrealized loss on derivatives, a $31 million tax adjustment related primarily to evaluation allowance on deferred tax assets and $18 million of leasehold impairments. None of these items impacted cash flow in the quarter. Excluding these and other smaller items adjusted earnings for the quarter were $38 million or $0.10 per share. Highlights for the quarter include upstream capital investment of less than $600 million, which demonstrates our commitment to running a discipline program and meeting our full-year upstream capital budget of $2.4 billion. For 2019, we have locked in pricing on much of our capital costs such as drilling rigs, pressure pumping services in sand. However, as John indicated, trucking, labor, fuel and chemical costs are trending higher with oil prices. First quarter operating costs, we're generally in line with guidance. LOE per BOE costs came in a bit higher than expectations, primarily driven by Egypt. Offsetting this gathering, processing and transportation costs were less than guidance. As we look at the remainder of 2019, let me first discuss our temporary production deferrals at Alpine High. Beginning in late March, for a variety of reasons, Permian Basin natural gas dipped to extremely low, and at times negative pricing. In response, Apache chose to defer a portion of our guest production at Alpine High. In the month of April, these deferrals averaged approximately 230 million cubic feet per day of gross wellhead gas. The deferred volumes are comprised of both lean and rich gas. And now we anticipate a continuation of week gas prices, until more transport capacity comes online later in the year. We currently plan to restore all of our rich gas production as we commissioned our first two cryo facilities over the next eight to 10 weeks. Apache is cognizant of the impact that gas deferrals have on Altus Midstream Company and has agreed to reduce certain shared overhead costs. We believe this is in the best interest of both companies. It has a negligible net impact to Apache and ensures that Altus remains in a good position to deliver on the critical near-term infrastructure build out at Alpine High. With this situation and other impacts in mine, we have updated our forward looking guidance on a number of items. Taking into account, a range of potential production deferrals for the remainder of the quarter, our second quarter Alpine High production outlook is 45,000 to 55,000 BOE per day. This is projected to increase to 85,000 to 95,000 BOE per day in the third quarter, which still includes the potential for some deferred volumes. Our 2019 rig schedule and completions activity is not impacted by the deferrals. As a result, we still expect that fourth quarter and year-end exit rates from Alpine High will exceed 100,000 BOE per day. In addition to issuing at 2019 quarterly guidance at Alpine High, we have also introduced quarterly Permian oil guidance and international guidance. The details of which can be found in the supplement on our website. For upstream capital investment, we are expecting the second quarter to be in the $650 million to $700 million range and full-year capital investment remains at $2.4 billion, as originally planned. For LOE, we are increasing our guidance to recognize some additional costs in Egypt as well as the impact of lower volumes in Alpine High. Our full-year LOE is now expected to average around $8 per BOE. Next, I would like to review some upcoming changes, which will significantly improve the cash flow generation from Alpine High. While we have been clear that Alpine High is a diversified resource with all three hydrocarbons phases at its core, it is an enormous rich gas play and the key to value creation is full recovery and monetization of the NGL stream. Today we'd process rich gas through mechanical refrigeration units, which are not very efficient, so we don't recover the full NGL stream. The resulting small volumes of NGLs are currently truck to a facility where they can be transported to Mont Belvieu and fractionated. This temporary setup is relatively high costs and significantly squeezes the cash margin. Finally, we are selling most of the residue gas at Waha, which as we spoke about previously, prices at around zero today. The result is extremely low margins and minimal cash flow net to Apache. That is the reality of Alpine High today. But that is all about to start changing because of the preparations that have underway for nearly two years. By the end of this quarter, we will generate much higher NGO yields as we transitioned to cryo processing. We will receive much better NGL margins through transport and fractionation under our long-term fixed price contract with enterprise. And in a few months, when GCX is placed in service, we will transport residue gas out of the basin and receive Gulf Coast pricing. And our supplement, we have included a slide illustrating the cash generating potential at Alpine High, assuming full utilization of a single cryo unit with 200 million cubic feet per day of nameplate processing capacity. To summarize the key takeaways, 200 million cubic feet per day of gross wellhead gas process through Altus’ cryo facilities is capable of generating $270 million to $300 million of annualized revenue under a very reasonable range of commodity price assumptions. Note this is net revenue to Apache after royalties. After further netting out all gathering, processing, fractionation and transportation fees as well as projected operating costs and state severance taxes, Apache’s annualized net cash flows from a single cryo facility are expected to range from $135 million to $165 million. So this transition will begin in the next few weeks and will carry on through the rest of 2019. By the end of this year, we will have three of these cryo facilities in service with all three of them expected to be operating at full capacity sometime in 2020. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to address our thoughts on returning cash to investors. Coming into 2019, we committed to returning at least 50% of excess free cash to investors, before increasing capital activity. With the stronger than planned year-to-date oil prices and the coming proceeds from asset sales, we will soon be in a position to begin that process. We will accomplish this through debt reduction, share repurchases or most likely a combination thereof. To the extent we choose to include some debt reduction that would likely begin with retiring $150 million of debt that matures in July, all of this is of course in addition to our ongoing dividends. Also, just to be clear, we have no plans to change our capital activity set. In conclusion, we have began the year well, building on the momentum from 2018. We continue to execute on our strategy of delivering returns-focused short cycle growth in the Permian Basin, sustaining our international businesses for long-term free cash flow generation in building growth opportunities for the long-term through exploration. 2019 will be a promising step forward. Alpine High is on the doorstep of generating significant cash flow with the startup of cryo processing and transported gas to the Gulf Coast, and we will commence exploration activities on Block 58 in Suriname this summer. While we are prepared to proceed on a sole risk basis, we are actively considering proposals from numerous would-be partners. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research.
Robert Brackett: Hey, good morning. I had a question on Block 58 in Suriname. It looks like the lease expires the initial exploration term June 24 of next year. Can you talk about the renewal process or the extension process on that lease?
John Christmann: Bob at this point, we've worked with the government of Suriname. We've got a one rig or one well, commitment kicks us into the next phase. And obviously we will commence that well ahead of that time schedule, so it'll kick us into the next phase and that's all we've shared publicly at this time.
Robert Brackett: And the next phase is a – it’s two to three-year extension, and is there any relinquishment involved?
John Christmann: It kicks us well into Phase II and at this point, we have not given any more color on Phase II.
Robert Brackett: Okay. Appreciate it.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from John Freeman of Raymond James.
John Freeman: Hi, guys.
John Christmann: Good morning, John.
John Freeman: Following up on Suriname, given the unsolicited sort of interest you've had from potential partners, and you all talked about, you'd be willing to proceed on an individual basis. Does this in any way sort of possibly delay when you spread the well while you kind of review all these proposals before you spread it?
John Christmann: Not at all. I mean, we're on a path. We're prepared – we’ll be prepared to drill multiple wells, and we’ve said we’ve got a one well commitment with the rig and three optional wells, and we're prepared to head down the path we're on. So not at all.
John Freeman: Okay. And then just on – the follow-up for me on Slide 11 on Alpine High and the cost improvements that you all broke out when you look at sort of pad development versus the other wells. Can you remind me what percentage of the activity right now is on pads versus the rest of the wells?
John Christmann: I mean the bulk of it is shifting to pads. What you've got in there is just the quarter numbers. It was kind of 194 versus what it would have been in terms of the pads at 153 type numbers. So we're shifting in the pads, but it's some of the testing and some of the other wells would drive that. But you're seeing us move predominantly into pad development with some larger pads coming.
John Freeman: Great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Douglas Leggate of Bank of America.
Douglas Leggate: Well, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. John, I wonder if I could pull this a little bit on Suriname. I would understanding is that when the well was drilled in the adjacent block, there was down or on up dip oil well that was tied by that well, which obviously bodes very well for your blog? So my question is, how have you chosen the location of the well and given that - assuming not correct. Why wouldn't you drill the location right up against the Guyana border?
John Christmann: Well, I mean, the first thing is we know we've got an active hydrocarbon system Doug. We've got seven plays when you look at our block, I mean it's just an unbelievable walk and as we've said more than 50, very large prospect. So we obviously have chosen our first well location. We have not disclosed that. But clearly we've taken into account any information we have through public means that's out there.
Douglas Leggate: Would it be reasonable to assume that would be, how can I put it one of the top two or three targets on the block to basically try and make sure your side of it?
John Christmann: I wouldn't want to assume anything about the top three targets on the block, but clearly you've got a discovery a that is on the lease line and that's your bodes well for us. But I hate you assuming anything.
Douglas Leggate: Understand. My follow-up is also about Suriname if you don't mind that. It really goes to your point about 100%. These wells and the adjacent block are quite an expensive relatively speaking $50 million to $100 million given the potential impact on farmed and value in the block. Why wouldn't you drill it 100%?
John Christmann: Well, I mean, as of today we still on the block 100% and that's the path we're marching down. So I mean the reason we wouldn't is because somebody talked us out and doing that.
Douglas Leggate: Fair point. Forgive me. I was going to try one final one. Out of sign beat on the road, talking a little bit about this on the prospect backlog and just share with everybody what you see as your risk prospect by lock in the block. And I will leave it there. Thank you so much.
John Christmann: I mean I just think it's a phenomenal block. Our timing and when we picked it up, we were just fortunate that we picked this at the middle of 2015 when there was not a lot of activity, a lot of interest. We were able to do it but before Exxon drill laser and before we drilled our first well and it was a really, really low price in terms of the commitment at the time and it is very well-positioned as we've said. There's multiple plays. We've got both shallow and deepwater targets that we can get to. And I mean, when you look at the size of this 1.44 million acres, I mean, that's larger than range county just for perspective. And there's more than seven different plays and 50 plus very large prospect. So we're anxious to kind of get going.
Douglas Leggate: Good luck, John. Appreciate the answers. Thank you.
John Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson of Stephens.
Gail Nicholson: Good morning, everybody. Can you talk about where the decline rate is at the 40 field now in North Sea with the Waterford management that you were doing and how that has changed maybe any near-term PNA you would have it Forties?
John Christmann: Gail, I mean, I think what you've seen as we've changed philosophically how we approaching that and we really are managing the Waterford. I do not have the particulars off the cuff, but we are seeing long-term trends that are flattening that decline. If you look at the abandonment timeframe, even prior it's been in the 2032 to 2035 time reframe, I think this pushes that back And most importantly, it just provides stability, to the rights out there. So but I don't have those – we’ve not what's been done. I would say you could look at some of the work that would Mac I think recently updated some of their work that is starting to reflect some of that. But I don't even think their report captures all of what we see.
Gail Nicholson: Okay. Great. And then just looking at the improvement you guys have seen in the Alpine High well cost. You've only done a slightly longer laterals. Can you just talk about how you envision lateral link progression over them, the next I guess several years and what you think that the farther I do from a cost improvement standpoint on the drilling aspect?
John Christmann: Well, I mean the big thing we've got down there as you don't have a lot of shallow production you're having to deal with. We also don't have a lot of chirrup and hard rock like you have up in the Oklahoma area. So you can get down quickly. We've been able to eliminate some casing strings. Clearly, the land position will dictate some are lateral lengths. The other big factor we've got in the source interval as you do not have water. And so with your longer laterals, you're going to get the productivity increases on a relative as you increase your lateral foot basis. Most of our wells have been shorter in the north because that's where our land, retention has been. And so that's what you're saying. But clearly, as we get the opportunity to drill longer laterals, you'll see, us transitioning mayor and I think you're going to continue to see costs come down. If you look at our numbers, we've had great progress and we continue to see progress is those programs have continued this quarter, so a lot of really good things happening on – at Alpine High.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Scialla of Stifel.
Michael Scialla: Yes. Good morning. Steve, walk us through some pretty good detail on the uplift you expect to see with the cryo plants coming on Slide 12. Just wondering with Waha Hub gas prices where they are, was there any discussion with all this to maybe potentially delay a ramping up that first cryo plant until the GCX a line goes into service in October? Can you just talk about that and if not, how does that ramp at the first cryo plant look in terms of the timing?
John Christmann: Yes. So the back part of your question first, the cryo number one is – it is being commissioned now, and it should be a – it should be full by the end of May. In terms of – well cryo number two will be – it's actually moved up in the schedule and be commissioning in June. It will be full by the end of July. In terms of considering the possibility of moving those back in the schedule, no, we did not consider that at all. We want to get those things up and running. We want to get the rich gas flowing again and we want to get those things working to the full extent possible of extracting that NGL content out of that rich gas stream. We've got enough gas today or fill cryo number one, and we will have enough gas, by the end of July to fill cryo number two. So those will be fully functional and full of rich gas, on the day they're ready to go full. The primary reason why we didn't, as you can look at that that slide, in the pack that we gave out, you can see the gas is certainly an important part of the full operating cash margin from the rich gas at Alpine High, but it's not the dominant piece. There's some oil content in those rich gas wells and there's the NGL yields. And there's – even if gas is selling at zero, you can see that that's still above a breakeven cash flow situation. Once we get those things fall. So we want to get them operational. We're going to get them up and running and GCX is not far away. Its official startup date is October 1 and that's not that's not too long away.
Michael Scialla: Thanks for that. And maybe a follow-up, can you just talk about your outlook for NGL prices over the next couple of years, obviously a key component as you said to the economics at Alpine High?
David Pursell: Yes. Hi, this is Dave Purcell. If you look at wide grade today and you look at Slide 12, we're running about current spot prices in the strip. It's about $24 a barrel that's really suppressed mainly by the light ends, particularly ethane. If you look at the ethane fundamentals going through the end of this year and into 2022, two things are going to happen. There's going to be more cracker capacity added on the Gulf Coast. There also be more dot capacity for exports added. So as you look through the next 18 months, we think there's much more upside and downside to the current ethane price and we think that will start to move the overall wide grade higher.
Michael Scialla: Thank you.
John Christmann: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: And your next question comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice.
Charles Meade: Good morning, John to you and your whole team there.
John Christmann: Good morning, Charles.
Charles Meade: If I could ask two questions on Alpine High. One just the quick one, real quick is to clarify. So when you have this cryo startup in July, you may still have some issues with the natural gas pricing. But your NGL pricing at that point you're connected at the tail pipe to get Gulf Coast pricing at that point for your engine.
John Christmann: Yes. It will start moving to Mont Belvieu through our enterprise agreement. So we'll start see an immediate uplift.
Charles Meade: Got it. And then the second question, this gets more on the well spacing and those kind of intriguing results you guys put out with the Mont Blanc and the Blackfoot pad. I recognized this early, but does this suggest that there's going to be any changes to the type curve – individual well type curve in the number of locations that you guys have in the Woodford or is this perhaps instead just something that's going to be localized to these areas?
John Christmann: No, I mean, I think it shows the process, and the methodical process we've taken to kind of break the rock down and get to what we think is the optimal development scenarios. In both cases, we drilled some Woodford C because we needed to see as thick is the column is as much rock as we have to deal with, we needed to see how the A's, B's and C's performed together. We clearly went a little wider spacing, a little larger fracs at the Mont Blanc, you're seeing some pretty impressive results. So some of that's also about changing. So as we've said, in the future you're probably going to see us drop the A's a little deeper, drop the B’s a little deeper or eliminate the C’s and a little wider spacing and then we'll continue to learn on the fracs. But I think, the big thing is the last location count we put out was fall of 2017, I think, October, 2017, and we're still in a position where location count would go up given the assumptions we've got in place. And that's why we've been very careful to do our testing and understand it. We never assume more than two in the Woodford or the Barnett. And we're very confident in those numbers. And you're seeing some strong performance. 
Charles Meade: That's helpful context. Thank you, John.
John Christmann: You bet, Charles.
Operator: And your next question is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer: Thank you. Good morning.
John Christmann: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Singer: I wanted to touch based on a couple of items, the first on exploration outside of Suriname. Can you just give us an update on how that's progressing and any expectations for making any of the ideas you're pursuing open to the public market? And then also a follow-up on the comments you made on assets sales to what degree are you pursuing and how meaningful could further assets sale will be?
John Christmann: Well, I mean, I think from the get-go, we've always said we were going to differentiate ourselves through exploration. And we do have a Lower 48 program, it’s focused DUS, it's focused more oil, it's focused more on conventionally, and our strategy has always been to try to build positions of scale and size where there was an opportunity – and low cost, where there was an opportunity to try to do in order to create meaningful value for our shareholders. So we have a program there. With the appropriate time, we'll talk more about that. As far as your second question on the asset sales, clearly we have over $300 million now that's under contract. As we said, the bulk of that is our SCOOP/STACK position. And I think the point there, Brian, as we look at our portfolio and we look at the things that we will be funding to the extent there's things that we will not fund in the future and if there's an opportunity for somebody else to own those and create value by purchasing those then we're not afraid to do that. And that's where we find ourselves today with the success we've had through our organic expiration program. We continue to take a long-term view through our portfolio model at our areas and what's going to attract capital. And we did not see the SCOOP/STACK is an area where we would be putting capital and therefore, we have it under contract.
Brian Singer: Great. Thanks. And if I could ask one more. On Slide 8, you highlight a trajectory in the Permian relative of the timing of completions and as you show in both 2018 and 2019, you've had a couple of quarters of frac holidays? Is that's kind of the way you're planning going forward to achieve desired growth there to basically try to batch completions into two quarters of the year or is that just the way it's ended up?
John Christmann: No. It's just really coincidental with the way - the programs is lined up. When you go to larger pads, it becomes a little more lumpy. I think the key here for us is early in 2018, we had to put a crew on a frac holiday because we'd had the drilling efficiencies and picked up and in terms of the – on the - well I'll say the completion efficiencies and picked up and they're drilling rates hadn't caught up yet. And so we had to set up frac crew down and what’s you saw as the timing of that. The one going into this year was really his prices dropped in November. We anticipated that we needed to drop a couple of rigs. We put a frac crew on holiday, that's really so we could deliver the capital budget that we have set for this year. So I think those were actions we've taken to level low the activity set to where we need to be for this price environment. And so we dropped a couple of rigs and put a crew on holiday. The trade-off there is as your second quarter production. We'll dip a little bit. But we think in the grand scheme of things, I would rather have more of a level loaded program throughout the year, which is how we positioned ourselves.
Stephen Riney: Just adding to that a little bit, Brian. John commented on the lumpiness of the activity said. That just becomes a lot more visible when your capital program is reduced to the size of what we're – where we are today. The lumpiness of an efficient drilling and completion had level activity set just becomes a bit more visible. That's all.
Brian Singer: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: And your next question comes from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets.
Scott Hanold: Thanks. My first question, hopefully pretty quick on the NGLs. Once a cryos are on, could you remind us what the product breakdown of that NGL basket is going to be for you guys? 
Stephen Riney: Yes. I don't think the NGL yield in Alpine High is going to be any different than the NGL yield anywhere else. We have an operated these types of cryo units before. So that would probably be a good question for a second or third quarter results when we've actually operated a couple of them for a bit.
Scott Hanold: Okay. I understand. Thank you. And that sort of the – so just certain average barrels which you're basing that $24 a barrel assumption right now that you put out there?
Stephen Riney: Well, we just stuck an assumption out there on the pricing at $24. We just said 40% of WTI, that's about where it's trading today. That's a reasonable assumption. We think that's conservative for the long-term for multiple reasons that Dave Pursell laid out earlier. And just on a mixed NGL barrel basis, 40% of WTI is probably especially if you look back in time it moves around a lot obviously, but 40% is probably a conservative assumption.
Scott Hanold: Okay, fair enough. And my follow-up question is regarding the free cash flow, you all talked about ones these cryos start coming on online or at least the cash flow generation and also the asset sale proceeds and utilizing that. When you step back and look at him in a Apache stock is compared to say the last call it five years, it's at a pretty low point? Does it make sense to like, as you look to return cash to shareholders to be a little bit more focused on share buybacks right now or in how does that's potential Suriname well sort of play into that decision?
Stephen Riney: Well, I don't think that Suriname well plays into that decision for 2019. Let's get the transactions close, which will happen in the second quarter. We'll proceed slowly, but we said we would return the excess free cash at least 50% of that shareholders before we changed our activity level. I think we said it a couple times in the prepared remarks. We'll say it again. There's no change in activity level for 2019. We're still on the 2.4 billion capital program. And I just remind everybody that the startup of the cryo facilities and the cash flows from those were in the plan for this year. So those aren't necessarily delivering excess free cash flow. They're delivering the plan free cash flow to the extent they start early, to the extent that NGL prices improve. To the extent that they give us a greater yield than we may have planned. And those types of things deliver excess free cash flow, but not just the startup from them. And we will look at I think as we get to the second half of the year, which is a going to be upon as pretty quickly, that's when we'll get into the discussions about how do we use that excess cash flow. And I could assure you that both the debt reduction and a share buybacks will be on that agenda. And in that conversation you were likely to do some of both there's some debt maturing 150 million of debt maturing in July. If we choose to paydown any debt, then that would probably be where we would start.
Scott Hanold: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from John Aschenbeck from Seaport Global.
John Aschenbeck: Good morning everyone and thank you for taking my questions.
John Christmann: You bet, John.
John Aschenbeck: Thanks John. So there's been a lot of commentary around 2019 spending. So I apologize if I missed this. But just thinking about the remainder of the year, if I run and admittedly over simplified exercise and take your Q1 spend and your Q2 guidance, it would just indicate that spendings coming down in future quarters. So is that an accurate assessment? And then secondly, it just – how should we think about the cadence of spending and the second half of the year? Thanks.
John Christmann: Well, I mean, I think the first thing is we're down 27% over fourth quarter and we actually came in right at 25% of what we guided for the year. So first quarter was pretty evenly run for how the year would pan out. We walked through in the prepared remarks, some things that could cause second quarter would be a little higher, which is kind of why we guided there, but there are more exploration driven. So I think from our perspective, we took the bigger decision in November and December to drop some rigs and put a crew on holiday to kind of do that now. And it puts us in a nice position for the back half of the year. So we're very confident in the capital number. We will come in under – or at the $2.4 billion for this activity set and feel really good about it.
John Aschenbeck: Okay, great. That's helpful John. So just to make sure I clarify there Q2 has some one time spending a lot of it exploration activity that you just wouldn't expect to repeat and future quarters. Is that fair? 
John Christmann: I would just say that in terms of the timing of how we – what we have budgeted for a Suriname and the exploration, a big chunk of that is in Q2 and the other thing you need to look at is if you look at our first quarter numbers, we do have some assets sales. We've had a couple of rigs running up there too. So our run rate for Q1 would have even been a little lower on what are going our existing asset base remaining will be.
John Aschenbeck: Okay, great. I'll go ahead and leave it there. Thanks for the time.
Operator: And your next question comes from Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities.
Richard Tullis: Thanks. Good morning, John. Two quick questions.
John Christmann: Good morning.
Richard Tullis: Going back to the M&A, I know you touched on this a bit little earlier, but as you look at the North Sea, I know the market there seems a little more active. How do you view those assets in your portfolio today? Given the healthy margins there, but balancing that with maybe a more healthy M&A market in the North Sea?
John Christmann: Well, I mean I think the big difference with us is, as opposed to what's being divested by some of the other parties is we invested in the infrastructure. If you look at our efficiency and our up times and our run rates and our LOE, we're very competitive. I mean we typically lead in production efficiencies and low cost and it's because, we were fortunate that after we bought these properties in the 2003 with BP for 40s and then 2011 with Beryls. We invested heavily in rebuilding the infrastructure, which really puts us in a nice position. So you look at those two assets. They're fantastic assets. They're different. 40s, we've just got a massive 5 billion barrel in place. Field is produced over 2.5 and it just continues to give. And so it's real easy to manage that for the long-term with the water flood work we're doing, and we love the Brent pricing. We love the margins and it's not like we have a lot of stuff looming that would require you to want to move out of it. If you look at Beryl, it's a totally different asset, very prolific in its own right as you've seen. The way we've been able to leverage the infrastructure with the subsea tie backs by bringing on Callater and bringing on Beryl or Gartner. And now you into the Beryl facility and now you look at the Storr well, we just announced, I mean, we found a whole another section there in the cormorant that we were not expecting. So there's a lot to do up in the Beryl area and we've got nice infrastructure. It's been invested in. It's in great shape and it gives us a differential advantage. So we love the cash flow. We love the Brent pricing exposure. Your gas receives a higher price. So it's an asset that we quite frankly, I liked the cash flow profile from.
Richard Tullis: Good insight John. Appreciate that. And just lastly, what's the current outlook for Alpine High natural gas to be sold into the Mexican market, say, over the next year or two?
John Christmann: Well, I mean, I think the first thing is, if you look at how we're positioned physically for gas to flow, we couldn't be better. But I think we recognized from the get-go that, you don't want to be trying to develop a resource play and waiting on Mexico or dependent on Mexico for your gas deliveries. And so that's why we work the options to the Gulf Coast and what you'll find is Mexico will be an option for on down the road, which I think can become a premium. But today it's not something we're counting on. I mean, that's why we work the Gulf Coast options. We will be mainly insulated from Waha here pretty quick, which is going to put us in a differential advantage on our gas. And, and really it's the NGLs that really make this thing fly. The NGLs cost structure and the lack of water or the things that really differentiate the rich gas played at Alpine High.
Richard Tullis: Very good. Thanks John. Appreciated.
Stephen Riney: Yes. Richard, if I could just add to that. I don't know the exact numbers, but today Mexico takes about 4 Bcf a day from the U.S. via pipeline. And 3 to 3.5 of that comes along the Gulf Coast. And so while we've got these great pipelines running by Alpine High, those are for the future more than the current. And so I think your question was related to the near-term. The near-term is we get gas to the Gulf Coast with the startup of GCX this year and Permian Highway next year. You can easily access the Mexican market and you might imagine that we probably have been considering that are working on that.
Richard Tullis: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon of Tudor, Pickering.
Jeoffrey Lambujon: Good morning. Thanks. First question is just on gas coverage with Gulf Coast Express. Once that system comes online and thinking about your capacity there, can you speak to how long you are able to receive Gulf Coast pricing for 100% of your Alpine High volumes?
Stephen Riney: Sorry, Jeff, can you just repeat that question?
Jeoffrey Lambujon: Yes. So once GCX comes online, just trying to get a sense for how long you expect to receive Gulf Coast pricing for your Alpine High production?
Stephen Riney: How long before we receive it or how long will we receive it?
Jeoffrey Lambujon: How long will you receive coverage for 100% of your production?
Stephen Riney: Well, with Gulf Coast Express, we will pretty much be selling all of the residue gas at Gulf Coast pricing with the startup of GCX and then Permian Highway comes a year later. So Gulf Coast Express, we have 550 million a day of capacity, and then with Permian Highway, we have another 500 million.
Jeoffrey Lambujon: Got it. And then just a follow-up on the liquids front. Appreciate the color on ethane, Dave, and sorry if I missed any follow-on comments on the LPG outlook, but could you just speak to what you're seeing there over the near-term?
David Pursell: Yes. So Jeoffrey, you're talking about – define near-term for me?
Jeoffrey Lambujon: Next 12 to 18 months.
David Pursell: Yes. Again, if you think about the NGL barrel, the bottom end of the barrel is going to trade with crude and gasoline and gasoline has been much improved over the last three or four months. So we're really thinking about butane and pentane, that's a call on crude and gasoline. So I'll leave that to you. Propane and ethane, we're going to see improvements in the fourth quarter in dock capacity through this and really through the summer and we think that'll help relieve some of the congestion with better exports. And then on ethane, in addition to better export capacity, we're seeing later this year and into 2020 more cracker capacity coming on line, and significant percentages of total – of current capacity. So at least in the next 18 months, I can envision a much more robust NGL pricing environment, particularly given improvements in ethane and propane.
Jeoffrey Lambujon: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan.
Arun Jayaram: Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. One, have you guys quantified the production impact from the planned SCOOP/STACK asset? So I was just wondering to know and does that already included in the guidance?
John Christmann: Arun, it’s not included, once it closes – but if we look at the first quarter numbers, it would've been about 10,000 BOEs a day, and about 13% oil, it's mainly gas.
Arun Jayaram: Mainly gas. Okay, that's helpful. And just a question… 
John Christmann: And more importantly, Arun, our lease up income was about 14, we spent half of that just in CapEx. So I mean it's a…
Arun Jayaram: It's not a big free cash flow again. 
John Christmann: It’s not a big impact on the EBITDA. 
Arun Jayaram: Fair enough. And just a question for the participation on the equity on the pipes, do you guys have an estimate of what the cost would be to Altus to participate in the pipes? Just the CapEx.
John Christmann: I think at 1 o'clock when the Altus is called is on Arun, you got to pop on and you can get Mr. Bretches at that time and you’ll feel that one, so.
Arun Jayaram: Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thanks a lot, John.
John Christmann: Appreciate it.
Operator: And we have passed the top of the hour. I'll now turn the call back to John Christmann for closing remarks.
John Christmann: Well, thank you for joining us. So just want to end on a couple of points. We're executing extremely well, delivering on both capital and production and are reiterating our $2.4 billion capital budget for the year. Alpine High will hit at an inflection point in the very near future as the three Altus cryos come on line and we'll generate a substantial cash flow uplift. And lastly, we're looking forward to the initiation of our exploration program at Suriname very soon.
Operator: And thank you all for joining today's Apache Corporation first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-28 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Rob, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation Fourth Quarter 2018 Results Conference Call. All lines have been place on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].  Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Gary Clark : Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial and operational results conference call. We will begin the call with an overview by Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann. Tim Sullivan, Executive Vice President of Operations Support, will then provide additional operational color; and Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO will summarize our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Also available on the call to answer questions are Apache’s Executive Vice Presidents: Mark Meyer, Energy Technology, Data Analytics and Commercial Intelligence; and Dave Pursell, Planning Reserves and Fundamentals. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 30 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our fourth quarter Financial and Operational Supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website, at investor.apachecorp.com. On today's conference call we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt's tax barrels. Finally, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today’s call, I will review Apache's fourth quarter production results, recap our key accomplishments in 2018, update and provide color on the 2019 outlook we issued a few weeks ago and conclude with some high-level direction out to 2021.  Our fourth quarter total adjusted production of 421,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter was in line with guidance. Strong international volumes offset slightly lower than expected US production. New wells in the North Sea at Callater and Garten drove international outperformance, while production in Egypt was generally in line with our expectations.  In the US Permian Oil production continued its trend of strong performance and sequential growth, significantly exceeding our guidance for the quarter. Natural gas and NGL volumes were lower than expected for several reasons, which Tim will outline in a few moments.  Our fourth quarter momentum has carried over into the current quarter, prompting an increase in the lower end of our full year 2019 production guidance range, as noted in yesterday's press release.  Before moving on to discuss our outlook for this year, I would like to briefly recap some of our key accomplishments in 2018. Each of our regions made great progress last year, and contributed to Apache’s strong growth, returns and financial performance.  Operationally, we grew total adjusted production 13% and Permian Oil production 18% over 2017, increased well productivity throughout the Permian basin and reduced drilling and completion costs offsetting much of the inflationary pressures that built in 2018.  Formed Altus Midstream Company, an entity capable of independently funding ongoing midstream investments at Alpine High, discovered and commissioned the Garten field, which increased our daily North Sea production to its highest level in two years, received three concession awards in Egypt over the prior 18 months comprising 2.2 million acres adjacent to our existing footprint, made tremendous progress our large-scale high-density 3D seismic acquisition and new prospect identification program in Egypt, and completed a comprehensive petroleum system assessment offshore Suriname and met numerous, large, drill-ready prospects on Block 58.  2018 was also an excellent year financially for Apache, as we increased cash flow from operations 56% year-over-year, delivered an approximate 22% cash return on invested capital, generated robust cash flow from our international operations of $2.4 billion and returned nearly $1 billion or 25% of our cash flow from operations to investors through dividends, share repurchases and debt reduction.  Overall, 2018 was a very good year. As we turn to 2019, the lower price environment has prompted us to reduce our capital investment program. We will focus investment on projects that balance near-term cash flow generation with long-term returns and value enhancement. In 2019, we are planning upstream capital investment of approximately $2.4 billion, which represents a 22% reduction year-over-year. Despite this decrease, our production growth will remain resilient.  As disclosed in our press release on February 7th, we are projecting fourth quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2019 production growth of 6% to 10% on a total company adjusted basis, 12% to 16% in the US, and 5% for Permian Oil.  Internationally, we are projecting a decline of 2% to 4% over the same time period. This however, is heavily skewed by the strong fourth quarter 2018 volumes we reported in the North Sea, due to the timing of new wells at Callater and Garten. Comparing what we laid out for 2019 a year ago to our current outlook, our capital program has been reduced, our production outlook has moved to the top half of our previous guidance range, and our Permian basin oil production has been and will continue to be significantly higher. Overall, we can deliver attractive and sustainable growth under a reduced activity set due to a high quality diversified portfolio, relatively low base production decline rate, and continuously improving capital investment efficiency. It is important to note, however, the growth at Apache is an outcome of our returns focused investment approach, and not the overarching objective. The changes required to deliver this plan are already being implemented.  Following the oil price downturn late last year, we have decreased our operated Permian rig count to 13. This compares to a range of 16 to 18 rigs that we have been running since mid-2017. With this and other activity reductions, we are projecting first quarter upstream capital in the low $600 million range. This is approximately $200 million below our fourth quarter 2018 upstream spend and puts us on a level pace to achieve our full year 2019 target of [$2.4 million].  Let's now look into some of the regional dynamics underpinning 2019. Our US capital program is heavily concentrated in the Permian Basin with a focus on rich gas at Alpine High and oil in the Midland and Other Delaware. We plan to run an average of 12 rigs and 4 frac crews in the Permian this year, with roughly half the activity allocated to Alpine high, and the other half predominantly to the Midland Basin.  Maintaining critical mass and proper rig frac crew ratios in these two key areas will enable us to deliver a very efficient capital program given the reduced budget. Apache's US oil production comes primarily from the Permian, including the Midland Basin, the Delaware Basin and Alpine High. This year, we will continue to develop all three, but at an appropriately reduced pace. Our oil drilling will focus primarily in the Wildfire, Powell and Azalea areas which comprise only a small percentage of our total prospective acreage in the Midland Basin. Investment in these areas will continue to leverage the tremendous productivity gains over the last three years, as well as the existing infrastructure. To-date we have drilled fewer than 25% of our known-drilling locations at Wildfire, Powell and Azalea. So there is still a tremendous amount of running room in these areas alone.  We have also initiated delineation activities in the nearby Benedum and Hartgrove areas in Upton and Reagan counties. This work enables us to begin planning and installing the facilities to efficiently develop these assets. The strong well results to-date indicate the potential for significant additions to future core growing inventory. In the Delaware Basin and Alpine High we are deferring oil-focused activities, however, substantial future opportunity remains. Apache’s Permian Basin program has improved tremendously over the last three years. We’re now producing at record levels, both in terms of total production and oil volumes. We have accomplished this with far fewer rigs and significantly less capital deployed in our prior production peak in late 2014.  Moving on to our rich gas development program in Alpine High, our focus this year will be on multi-well pad development drilling primarily in the Northern Flank of the field. With 600 million cubic feet per day of nameplate cryogenic processing capacity scheduled to come online in the second half of the year, we should realize a significant uplift in cash margins and cash flow generation.  We are decreasing our activity this year at Alpine High to five rigs and one frac crew. We’re deemphasizing dry gas drilling which will no longer be needed for blending purposes to meet pipeline specs following cyro processing installation. This will naturally result in lower volume growth than previously projected, but will increase our percentage of NGLs.  Apache’s new 2019 Alpine High production volume outlook is 85,000 to 90,000 BOEs per day for the year with the targeted year end exit rate in excess of 100,000 BOEs per day. Our projected year end NGL mix will approach 40% of net Alpine High volumes, up significantly from the previous guidance of 30%, which we provided a year ago.  Internationally Egypt, in the North Sea continue to play important roles in our diversified portfolio. Despite the lower commodity price environment, both regions will continue generating significant free cash flow. This year, we will maintain our activity set in the North Sea, which consists of one floating rig and two platform rigs.  In the Beryl area we plan to bring our store discovery online in the second half of the year and spud a second well at Garten.  In the Forties field we will focus on our waterflood and base decline management program augmented by platform rig activities. In Egypt, we continue to advance our large-scale seismic shoot from which a substantial number of attractive new targets have been identified thus far. We are also drilling exploration and delineation wells in each of our new concession areas, thereby, laying the foundation for potential future growth.  Turning to Suriname, we have completed a substantial geologic and geophysical evaluation of Block 58 and have a large number of high quality prospects across multiple different play concepts. We recently contracted a drillship and anticipate spudding our first well around midyear. Block 58 which Apache owns 100% is truly a world-class opportunity. This block is adjacent to the ExxonMobil operated Stabroek Block in neighboring Guyana and is on trend with numerous oil discoveries.  To wrap up our view of 2019, I want to emphasize that we are committed to returning to investors at least 50% of any free cash flow, inclusive of asset sale proceeds before increasing planned activity levels. While we have a deep drilling inventory and long list of projects we would like to accelerate, as we have done in the past, Apache will remain disciplined and flex the program subject to available cash flow. Should we encounter a further downturn in commodity prices, we have the flexibility to reduce our capital program.  Importantly, with the benefits of a diversified portfolio, Apache is capable of breaking even at WTI oil prices in the mid-$40s, while continuing to fund its dividend. We have included a slide in our supplement, if you would like to review our assumptions behind this metric in further detail.  I will conclude my remarks today by outlining our longer term view to 2021. Assuming WTI oil prices in the $50 to $55 per barrel range, we envision an annual upstream capital program of $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion. While the overall capital allocation and activity set will likely be similar to 2019, the specifics of the program will remain fluid as we incorporate learnings.  We believe this investment level is capable of generating continued attractive production growth and returns with the US as the primary driver and international flat to slightly down. As in 2019 we will continue to manage for cash flow neutrality, and return 50% or more of any free cash flow to investors.  Permian Basin oil and Alpine High rich gas will be the primary drivers of US production growth over this timeframe, with NGLs comprising the fastest growing product stream.  In the US our deep inventory of development opportunities will continue to drive production growth, lower F&D costs and increasing returns for the long-term. This will be supplemented by our continuing organic exploration programs in the Lower 48.  Our longer-term international production outlook is characterized by a modest decline in the North Sea and flat to potential growth in Egypt. Our new concessions and seismic imaging in Egypt help establish the foundation for an appropriately paced long-term exploration and development program. This is good for the country of Egypt and for Apache as we believe our operations are capable of growing both production and free cash flow.  In closing, 2018 was a year of strong execution across the portfolio which translated into our best financial performance in four years. We are off to a good start in 2019 and have a disciplined plan to deliver long-term returns and growth, supported by a deep inventory of development locations and exciting exploration opportunities in the US and internationally.  Over the next three years Apache is committed to cash flow neutrality and we will continue to return meaningful capital to our investors.  With that, I will turn the call over to Tim Sullivan, who will provide some operational details on the quarter. 
Timothy Sullivan : Good morning. My remarks will briefly cover fourth quarter 2018 production and operations performance and activity in our core regions. I will also provide some details on our planned activity in 2019, and touch on our outlook for US service costs.  Operationally, we had another very good quarter, led by the Permian Oil production and the North Sea. We achieved companywide adjusted production of approximately 421,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 5% increase from the third quarter 2018 and up 16% from the fourth quarter 2017.  In the US, Permian Oil was our biggest growth driver with an increase of more than 8,000 barrels of oil per day or 9% compared to the third quarter. The Midland Basin, Delaware Basin and Alpine High, all contributed to this sequential Permian Oil increase.  Total production for the Permian was up 6% for the third quarter, despite several events across the region that reduced production by approximately 10,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter. This included excessive downtime due to outages at third-party facilities in the Midland and Delaware basins and weather disruptions.  At Alpine High, gas volumes were impacted by a field-wide shut down for several days that pressured on gas sales lines and completions timing. Apache averaged 16 drilling rigs and four frac crews in the Permian Basin during the quarter, drilling and completing 65 net wells up from 44 net wells in the third quarter. In the Midland Basin we placed 26 wells online, all of which were on multi-well pads. Our results are benefiting from a consistent, steady operational cadence across the Midland Basin.  In 2018, approximately 75% of our drilling program was focused on development drilling in Azalea, Powell and Wildfire areas, yielding predictable and economically robust drilling results.  One example of the type of longer-term results this program is yielding is the nine-well Wolfcamp pad at Powell, which we discussed last quarter. After 245 days online this Wolfcamp pad has cumulative production in excess of 1.5 million barrels of oil and 2 BCF of gas and continues to produce approximately 4,000 barrels of oil per day and 9.5 million cubic feet per day of gas. The remaining 25% of the program in Midland Basin consisted of delineation drilling on other acreage blocks.  Most notably, in our Benedum area located in Upton County, this four-well pad was 2 mile laterals targeted four different landing zones and achieved an average 30 day IP of 1,646 BOE per day per well with nearly 80% oil cuts. We’re excited about these results as it sets up a number of locations for future drilling.  Shifting to the Delaware Basin we drilled a four-well pad in the Palmillo area of Eddy County, New Mexico, which averaged the 30 day IP of more than 1,700 BOE per day, 79% oil and these were drilled with 1 mile laterals. We plan to drill 20 wells in the area during 2019 and we will still have many years of inventory into play.  Please refer to the quarterly supplement for production details on these and other wells highlighted from the quarter.  At Alpine High our net production for the quarter averaged approximately 58,000 BOE per day. We exited the fourth quarter producing approximately 70,000 BOE per day on a net basis. We placed 26 wells on production in the field during the fourth quarter, bringing total wells placed on production for the year to 94.  Highlights during the quarter include six wells at the Mont Blanc pad in the Northern Flank, which targeted two zones in the Woodford formation and averaged a 30 day IP of 16.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day of rich gas. This pad advances our learnings from the previously disclosed Blackfoot pad and demonstrates improvements in capital and production efficiency, utilizing improved configurations and larger fracs from fewer wells.  Also in the Northern Flank, we drilled the Iroquois State 201AH, which targeted the Barnett formation and averaged a 30-day IP of 7.6 million cubic feet of rich gas and 213 barrels of oil per day. These wells are indicative of the drilling program that we have planned for this year and we're looking forward to processing the rich gas to our new cryogenic facilities coming online in the second half of the year.  Our lease position at Alpine High is approximately 300,000 net acres as of year-end 2018. Consistent with our October 2017 webcast, we let a portion of our leasehold with known higher geologic risks expire. These areas were never included in our previously disclosed location counts.  Turning to service costs, in the Permian we have successfully locked in attractive rates for rigs, frac crews and sand for 2019. We’ve budgeted for slightly lower year-over-year service costs overall at $53 WTI oil price forecast. We continue to monitor the marketplace to secure cost competitive and high-performance services and supplies.  Before commenting on our international operations, I would like to address our US production trajectory for 2019. Production in the first half of the year is expected to be relatively flat with Q4 2018 volumes, as we've reduced our operated rig count and implemented a three month frac holiday with one of her two frac crews in the Midland Basin. We then see a fairly significant second half volume ramp resulting from the cryo commissioning at Alpine High, accelerating completions with return of the second frac crew in the Midland Basin and the startup of development in the North Sea.  As we stated in our press release a few weeks ago, we expect robust 4Q exit rates in 2019, giving us good momentum into 2020. Internationally, in Egypt, we drilled and completed 24 gross operated wells with a 96% success rate during the fourth quarter, and 110 total wells for the full year.  Our 3D seismic acquisition in the Western Desert continues. To-date we have acquired data over 1.25 million acres completing acquisition in our legacy West Kalabsha and Shushan areas. Seismic acquisition in our new Northwest Razzak Concession is in progress for completion later this year.  More than 40 new lease have been identified thus far from early data processing and we are currently drilling our first prospect based on the new 3D in our West Kalabsha area.  Over the next couple of years, we will continue to build our high-quality inventory in Egypt as a result of the new concessions and acquisition of the new 3D. This will make our drilling program more capital efficient and set the stage for future potential growth in oil production and free cash flow.  Moving to the North Sea, production averaged approximately 63,000 BOE per day during the quarter, a 25% increase from the preceding period as turnaround activity was completed in the third quarter, and we realized a full three months of production from the fourth development well at Callater and the startup of the Garten development in November.  Garten has already produced over 1 million barrels of oil and 1.3 BCF of gas and is currently producing at 11,500 barrels of oil per day and 12 million cubic feet of gas. We’re planning on second development well for Garten, which we will spud later this year. We’ve also identified two geologic analog prospects, which we are assessing for inclusion in our 2020 drilling program.  Operationally, we’re off to a good start and anticipate another strong year in 2019.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve.
Stephen Riney : Thank you, Tim. Today I will review our fourth quarter financial results, briefly touch on Apache’s 2018 highlights and provide some further color on our 2019 financial guidance. As noted in the press release issued last night under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported fourth quarter 2018 net loss of $381 million or $1 per diluted common share. These results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings, which are typically excluded by the investment community and published earnings estimates.  The most significant of these items were various impairments taken during the quarter. In the US onshore we took an after-tax impairment of $253 million for oil and gas properties, primarily in the Anadarko Basin. In the offshore we took a $90 million after-tax impairment on a legacy investment in the Gulf of Mexico specific industry consortium.  In Egypt, we took an after-tax impairment of $63 million on three concessions that are unlikely to recover certain carry-in costs prior to the end of term due to inadequate remaining revenue potential. And in the North Sea we took an after-tax leasehold impairment of $71 million on a previous discovery, which no longer has certainty of future development.  Due to the nature of this property, this impairment is found in exploration expense. Excluding these and other smaller items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $119 million or $0.31 per share.  Other than the production results previously outlined by John, most of the quarter's performance was as expected. Exploration expense was higher than normal, primarily due to the North Sea impairment I just noted and the write-off of other costs associated with the same item.  Looking at 2018 as a whole, I would highlight it was a very good year in terms of delivering on guidance and expectations, improving our ability to live within cash flow and improving our return to investors.  When compared to our original 2018 guidance provided last February it was a consistently strong performance on production volumes as US production exceeded our original midpoint guidance by 4% and international production delivered as guided.  On the cost side nearly all major items were in line with or better than the guidance we provided a year ago. Meaningful exceptions for UK cash taxes, which were higher than guided due to the strength in Brent oil prices and financing costs they were up due to some cost incurred to restructure a portion of the debt portfolio. Capital spending came in higher than original guidance, driven primarily by increased activity in the Permian Basin. This included incremental drilling to optimize completion deficiencies, higher completions intensity, facilities investment and additional testing.  In November Apache completed the Altus Midstream transaction. Apache had funded approximately $1.1 billion of midstream investment at Alpine High since announcing the discovery in 2016.  In addition, we had acquired valuable equity options in five pipeline projects to transport product from Alpine High to Gulf Coast markets. Altus now provides a separate vehicle to fund both the ongoing midstream buildout, as well as the near term required investment in the joint venture pipeline projects. This significantly improves Apache's forward-looking ability to fund upstream capital spending at an appropriate level commensurate with the price environment.  Financially, we delivered materially improved returns for the year, continued to strengthen the balance sheet and increased return of capital to investors. For the year, we paid out $382 million in dividends, repurchased $305 million of Apache common stock and reduced debt by $281 million.  I'll now move on to guidance for 2019. I won't go through each component, but I would like to highlight a few key items. We have reduced our 2019 upstream capital to $2.4 billion, of which approximately 75% is allocated to the US and 25% to international, which includes Suriname. Consistent with the past, we expect our growth patterns in the US to continue supported by a slightly declining international production.  As Tim outlined, our production growth will come primarily in the back half of 2019. This is driven by a combination of a frac holiday during the first quarter in the Midland Basin, the timing of large pad completions throughout the Permian Basin, and the volume uplift from cryo processing in Alpine High.  For the first quarter of 2019, adjusted production is expected to be approximately 425,000 BOEs per day, 287,000 BOEs per day in the US and 138,000 BOEs per day internationally. Upstream capital spending will be around $625 million.  We have provided details of both our first quarter and full year guidance in the Financial and Operational Supplement, which can be found on our website.  In conclusion, we closed out 2018 well and have great momentum transitioning into 2019. We are executing on our strategy to sustain our international businesses for long-term free cash flow generation and to focus growth investment in the Permian Basin. We also have a tremendous exploration portfolio, which provides great optionality for the future.  We are committed to maintaining financial discipline and living within cash flow in a $50 to $55 WTI environment, investing for long-term returns and returning capital to investors.  With the current portfolio and a separate Altus Midstream Company, we are well-positioned to deliver on those goals.  And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from line of Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
Bob Brackett: Yes, I had a question on North Sea operating cost. I noticed a pretty significant step down in that asset. Is that something we should expect on a going forward basis?
John Christmann: Well that’s just going to be predominantly the production coming on at Garten in the Beryl area, so I think it will continue end of -- early part of '19 and the well comes off a little bit before we drill offset, it probably starts to go back up. So that's more driven the BOEs rather than the fixed dollars. 
Bob Brackett: And can you talk about the reserve revisions, is that related to some of the write-downs, or is there something happening there on maybe a five year plan and you’re taking down some puds?
Dave Pursell: No -- this is Dave Pursell. The revisions were across the board and independent of impairments, a little bit here and there by region. We did have some basis differentials took some puds off but nothing that would be -- we point to as material, it’s more end of year bookkeeping.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. 
Scott Hanold : I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on Alpine High and it seems like there has been a bit of a shift in some of the focus more NGLs I guess deferring some of the oil drilling and specifically deferring some of the oil opportunities. Can you give us a little bit of color on sort of what drove that decision, was that more of trying to be more disciplined in spending in the near term, or was it more geologic based on what you seeing as you go forward in your plan?
John Christmann: No, Scott, it’s purely a function of the capital program. What you see is as we paired back a little bit internationally, I mean the world has changed from where we were on the last earnings call and we’ve taken CapEx down as you know for 2019 and then the 2020 and ‘21. So it’s really more a function of the program and what we've done is allocate that capital in a way that we can most efficiently invest it to drive the best long-term returns. You'll see continued programs, Egypt and the North Sea where we sustain and then in the US specifically we’ve kind of looked at how spin that Permian capital and we were dropping rig count from a 16 to 18 range to 12 and you're going to see if five-rig program focused on Alpine High mainly on the rich gas today as we can defer some of the other things. And you will also see a very tidy program in the Midland and Delaware where the rigs and frac crews are allocated to kind of maximize our productivity and capital efficiency. So it’s really just the luxury of being able to defer, will push back some timing on some testing and you’re going to see really two focus programs: Rich gas and then an overall oil program.
Scott Hanold : So would we expect that if oil price are higher than and you do have free cash flow that obviously previously you talked about getting back to shareholders, but as you look at increasing organic activity, would testing some of the old zones be a high priority for you all in Alpine High?
John Christmann: I mean I think as you look at our portfolio today, we’re committed to returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders and that would be inclusive of any asset sales. But secondly we paired back in Egypt our Permian Midland and Delaware as well as Alpine High. So there's really three areas that we’ve got some pretty strong programs that we would prioritize and think how do we start to put activity sets back but I mean it would be a combination of those areas. And it's a nice thing about having a portfolio with a low decline rates. We can gear down and still grow and generate strong long-term returns. 
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Gail Nicholson from Stephens. Your line is open.
Gail Nicholson: You guys talked about a slowdown of activity in Alpine and the deemphasizing of drydock developments. Are you still achieving a very healthy exit rate in '19 with more NGLs? But as we look at 2020 with that deemphasize of that dry gas developments, can you just talk about how that any changes to previous 2020 growth outlook and how we should think about composition in 2020 Alpine?
Stephen Riney : Well what we've done Gail is focused our programs and prior to having cryos coming on we were -- because the gas is so rich we will have to drill some of the dryer gas zones to blend on the pipelines back. So we will no longer have to do that and in 2019, 2020 and 2021. So even I think the key products is, is the program which we lay out a microenvironment it's pretty volatile today on a $50 to $55 world we've kind of laid out CapEx with likely or could be in the 2.5 billion to 2.8 billion ranges 2020 and ‘21, if you look at where we will exit '19, we’re going to exit '19 going into '20 in a much stronger place than we ended '18, coming into '19. So capital probably looks pretty similar as a carry forward and we’re confident that we can deliver mid single-digit to corporate rates at a minimum and there's a lot of factors that could cause that to improve as we start to look at that. 
Gail Nicholson: And then look just at the advancements that we've seen kind of in technology as well as seismic processing, has that helped you identified prospects better in Suriname, North Sea in Egypt and does any of those advancements changes your confidence level in success regarding what is your exploration target in those three areas?
John Christmann: Clearly, technology is driving a lot of change and if you look at Egypt where we've added new acreage in order we're shooting the moves state-of-the-art broadband 3D. We've shown pictures in the past in some of our investor deck so what the 2013 seismic look like versus the current seismic. So there's no doubt that we’re seeing a lot shakeout of that look in the Western Desert, I think our West Kalabsha we have identified now over 40 new prospects. So I think it's going to bear a lot of fruit and that's why we're pretty confident with the newer acreage and the new seismic in Egypt. It’s going to give us more inventory to really return Egypt to potentially growth area for Apache. Clearly in Suriname we've got the 3D, we’re excited -- that's a whole other topic about what Suriname can be, but 3D is a big piece there and then we continue to use 3D in our unconventional and onshore as well. It's been very key and was instrumental in the discovery of Alpine High and it remains a key piece as we go forward with the development plans. 
Operator: Your next question comes from line of John Freeman with Raymond James. Your line is open.
John Freeman : The first question, you all provided the base decline rate for the overall company. Would it be possible to get that broken down for the US versus international?
John Christmann: No, we haven't broken that out. I think what you've got is we're in the low 20s, and it's going to improve over the next couple of years, and we've got some conventional assets in the Permian that help and we’ve also got some unconventional that have a little higher more characteristic decline. So it's kind of a combination of the asset basis but we haven’t broken that out as of yet by area.
John Freeman: Okay and then I just had a -- my other question is sort of in regards to that, Slide 12 you have, sort of set out for ‘19, kind how you come up with the capital plan and sort of what happens if the oil price does or the commodity price does better than plan and how you kind split up the amount goes to the investor versus increased activity. I’m just trying to think about, make sure I’m on the same page that we’re thinking about. When you go into a year so let’s say in 2020 if we’re sitting here and oil is $70, does the plan get’s at some discount to where the strip is and then if the oil price does better than that’s upside or you all sort of think about it more from what your maintenance capital level is and then the plan is set at something just above that. I’m just trying to think about the way it sort of gets flexed up or down according to the commodity environment?
John Christmann: I mean I think the first is, we’re taking a multiyear look here and then in today’s world we’re $50 to $55 and we think as an industry to improve our competitiveness with other industries we’ve got to prove that we can deliver more capital to shareholders through the cycle. And so what we’ve said we will deliver a minimum of 50% to investors because we think that's a meaningful number. John it could be more and what we’ve said is that we would deliver a minimum of 50% before we increased activity but it’s clearly things we can get after. So I think in general, the point is as we’re damn serious about returning more capital to shareholders before we scale up our activity and our operations. 
Stephen Riney : Yes, John. This is Steve. I would just add to that saying that, that Slide 12 is actually poured from the actual plan we have in place for 2019, so it’s based on the 2.4 billion capital program and it’s based on the pricing environment that we find ourselves in today. And as John said previously in a $50 to $55 world out through ‘20 and ‘21 and we would have the capacity to spend $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion in that price environment still be cash flow neutral. It doesn’t mean that we would spend that much, but we could and still be cash flow neutral. If we woke up and found ourselves in a $70 world in 2020 we have to keep in mind that this maintenance capital would have some sort of an inflationary effect on that. I would imagine, and so this chart holds for the 2019 plan and it holds for a $50 to $55 price environment but when you get into a different price environment we just need to contemplate that kind of stuff. 
Operator: Your next question comes from John Herrlin from Société Générale. Your line is open.
John Herrlin : Regarding Suriname, John, will you be drilling [8 ace] or you’re going to have a partner?
John Christmann: John today we own it a 100%. We’ve got a drillship coming this summer. We will drill a minimum of one wells up to potentially three additional. We are prepared to go a 100%. We also are willing to listen to proposals and things where somebody might talk us into letting somebody else participate with us. So but for now we’re a 100%.
John Herrlin : And then regarding the US impairments with Anadarko Basin since that was a prior acquisition, not to your administration. Is that something that will then be put up for sale?
John Christmann: When we look at the portfolio, we historically haven't announced when we were going to monetize assets and if you look at Canada, we usually came back and said we're going to do something after the fact. I think that we’re always looking at the portfolio and assets that we are not funding. If there's an opportunity for somebody to create value by putting those assets into their hands in a way that we think would make sense we would be open to do them and we will probably talk about it after we had done that if that were the case. But we’re always examining everything in our portfolio and looking at, does it belong and is it going to get funding or is it better off in somebody else's hands.
John Herrlin : And then with the GoM was it that self-insurance thing?
David Pursell: John, the GoM was the consortium that was put together back in 2011 for companies that were active in the Gulf of Mexico to respond to well incidents. 
John Herrlin : Okay. Yes, the insurance thing. Okay. 
David Pursell: We’re clearly not active in the Gulf of Mexico anymore so…
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon from Tudor, Pickering Holding Company. 
Jeoffrey Lambujon : In the past you mentioned slowing down in the Midland and legacy Delaware to progress learning in the Alpine High, it looks to be showing up an improved performance. So I was hoping if you could just speak to some of those more meaningful learnings as you’ve kind of progressed further on that?
John Christmann: Well I think Jeoff it boils down to, you go back in 2015, 2016, when we really went through a reset, we did a lot of strategic testing both in the Midland and the Delaware. We focused on pad development what is the special relationship between wells both vertically and horizontally. We focused on completions. And what you've seen is the use of technology, the learnings and the implementation of that you are now seeing that paid off in spades in our Midland and Delaware Basin programs. We've also been in the middle of that process at Alpine High, and we were conducting that with some of the key tests that we've talked about, our Blackfoot pad, our Mont Blanc pad. So it's a process that we continue and then I think the important thing is we've always talk, you need to think about things in terms of whole sections, full-scale of development and you have to keep integrating those learnings and you also have to recognize that the geology in each play is a little different and it's going to be in the [Elgin] Reservoir going to be key components in getting the what we call an optimized development program, and it's also why this year we’re going to be running nearly two focused programs when we look at it. There’s going to be a rich gas program at Alpine High, and you are going to see an oil focused program predominantly in the Midland and in Delaware. 
Jeoffrey Lambujon : And then separately on 2020, I appreciate the thoughts there on spending and how you are planning to exit 2019 with this year's plan. But as we dial-in next year, is there a good production range to think about that's associated with the 2.5 billion to of 2.8 billion that you've highlighted for next year?
John Christmann: Well, I would just say, what I said earlier, we will exit '19 and go into '20 on stronger footing than we've come into this year and in a similar price environment capital allocation likely would look pretty similar. Those things can change, the productivity can change. But we think our floor is going to be mid single-digits at the corporate level. And we think that can improve as we’ve proven in the past with efficiencies, some capital allocation, some other things.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. 
Brian Singer : As you flow the dry gas piece of Alpine High a bit, can you just talk about the financing options at the Altus Midstream level? It seems like that’s still in-house there but given the capital needs there and any risk of the need for equity infusion outside from other players like yourselves or others?
John Christmann: There is going to be a call, we want to collect a day on Altus, Brian. So I would just advise you to tune in there for the Altus call.
Brian Singer : I guess from an Apache perspective any comment on that or just wait for that call?
David Pursell: Brian I would just say from an Apache perspective, obviously we worked very closely with the Altus team and we don't anticipate any type of capital call on Apache none whatsoever, Altus is actively working their forward-looking capital program and looking at options and they see options for financing as some pretty attractive ones and I think they will be going forward with that. And again referring it to the call this afternoon to get more detail then. 
Brian Singer : I appreciate that color from the Apache perspective. And then as you slow the dry gas development at Alpine High and the oil delineation to focus more on wet gas and to be capital disciplined, do you ultimately see that oil delineation and dry gas production happening but at a later date and/or when you think about any excess cash flow above the 50% you would return to shareholders, do you see opportunities -- would you consider opportunities to bolster the portfolio broadly through bolt-ons or acquisitions?
John Christmann: Today clearly with what our opportunities set is, is we’re not looking to bolster the portfolio with acquisitions. We've got some very attractive programs that we have deferred. We will eventually resume some of that testing and there is quite a bit of ability to add activity in our Midland non-Alpine High, Delaware, and at Alpine high as well as on the international front in Egypt. So not seeing as we have not over the last four years thought about making to do something on the acquisition side.
Operator: Your next question comes from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your line is now open. 
Charles Meade : I wondered to ask a question about Alpine High. And perhaps we will have to wake at to 1 o'clock for this but you mentioned in your press release that you guys had field wide shut down and some facilities came online a little later than was planned. So wondering if you could just give a narrative on what happened in the quarter, whether those two events are connected, perhaps and if there is anything different that we should expect going forward over the course of 2018 for the built out?
John Christmann: I’ll let Tim jump in, in just a second but Charles the answer you got a one-time offset and we ended up putting a lot of water into the gas lines which required us to have to shut down the entire field for longer period. And then it took longer to get everything cleaned out, so it’s not an event that will occur in the future. And then the other was just purely timing of the way of moving the pad back. So I'll let Tim to give you some more details, but we exited the year kind of where we thought we’d be. It just was a little slower getting a few things on. 
Timothy Sullivan : Yes, Charles just a little more color on that, on the unplanned field wide shut-in, that was due to, we had a failure on the highway where we put some water down the sales line, so we had to shut the field in for a few days, we had to dig the line and then we’d to re-pressure that line, and then it just took a little longer to get everything up and running and back to full production. So, that was a big portion of it. Then John mentioned the deferrals too and that was really because of the rich gas drilling we had done and the MOUs that we've got, we were running into the BTU spec issues. So we had to delay the development of a number of rich gas wells to put some dry gas wells online to get our BTU spec back in place and that causeed the main issues at Alpine High. There were some minor timing issues just on new facility startups. But the first two were the main issues. 
Stephen Riney : Charles, this is Steve. I'd just add the obvious point and that is when your -- you've got an asset that's growing at the pace of Alpine High and you're bringing large pads on, movements of events in the quarter can actually make a big difference to a quarter. To state the obvious. 
Charles Meade : Always appreciated. 
Timothy Sullivan : All these issues have been resolved and we hit accelerate that we anticipated as well…
Charles Meade : Got it. And then Tim, maybe this is a question best for you. But I -- on your Midland Basin results in the quarter, one of the things that struck me is, curious or maybe a little countertrend it to what I've seen in the rest of the industry is that you guys have had better Wolfcamp results down in Upton County than you did in your June Tippett pad in Southern Midland. And it seems like for most of rest of the industry that productivity relationship was actually being reversed, the better wells have been up Northern Upton Southern Midland. So wondered if you could talk about what's going on there, and if it has any implications for the way you guys are going to rank your priorities going forward? 
Timothy Sullivan : Yes, we've had good results from both areas. The Upton County wells in particular the Powell and then the latest test that we did in Hargrove have been outstanding wells. And a little bit is based on some of the testing that we have done. That we’ve gone to development mode and we changed our spacing, most of our wells have been drilled in Upton County to-date, and that's what we've advanced our learnings the most. And I think we've got our spacing completely figured out there and our well completions. And as a result, we've seen it in our results. And I think we're going to see that same evolution up in Wildfire when we start drilling more wells there as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Arun Jayaram : I wanted to talk a little bit about Suriname. You guys have completed your seismic on Block 58 and presumably have the geo mapping it has those Exxon Hymera gas county discovery, which is on the Surinam line. What do you think will define the oil leg of what has -- and perhaps you could set the stage for your initial prospect that you will drill midyear?
John Christmann: Arun, we kind of talked internally, we need to make sure we send them a Christmas card. What it proves is you got hydrocarbons in the system. Clearly in a conventional setting you’re going to expect to see the condensates and the lighter hydrocarbons in the upper sections. I think what I would say is as we look at where they are and I understand they are also continuing to drill deeper themselves in that well, but we would -- so lot of our targets will be deeper where we would anticipate they will be oily as is the case over on the Stabroek block. It’s very, very encouraging. The thing we said in the script though I want to point out is we've got multiple play sites, more than a handful. The thing that’s unique about our block is, is you got shallow and deepwater access and there is both pre-and post unconformity plays. So we’ve mapped many, many high-impact prospects and we’re very excited what this could mean for the country of Suriname and Apache.
Arun Jayaram : And just a follow-up John. We’re reading into your capital allocation in the Permian in 2019 where we didn't note a little bit more activity in your Other Delaware and we’re just trying to think about -- respect the fact that Altus will put their topic later today but they did reduce their overall guidance from 19 to 21 so just trying to read into that what the capital allocation for Alpine High could look like over the next couple of two, three years?
John Christmann: Well as we said we’ve reduced rig count this year, we’re going down from seven or eight rigs at Alpine High to five. I mean we’re reducing our Permian rig count from 16 to 17 down the 12 to 13 and so both programs are going to be reduced as we said. Alpine will get its fair share but you're going to see two very focused programs where we can set up our rigs and frac crews appropriately to deliver optimal value for the capital investment. And we like the pace, we like the programs. We’re both are going to be very focused and pretty similar to what we've been doing fruitfully. 
Operator: Your next question comes from David Deckelbaum from Cowen. Your line is now open. 
David Deckelbaum : Just curious as you look at the -- you give the guidance around mid single-digit growth into 2020 and ‘21 with the $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion budget. I guess this year we saw the double-digit production growth coming out of US onshore. Should we assume that that continues sort of within that high-level model over the next couple years and is there a point in ‘20 and ‘21 program where we would see more growth capital going in Egypt following some of the acreage expansions and seismic activity that you’ve had there?
John Christmann: I mean I think there is no doubt we’re going to have the opportunity to put more capital into Egypt as we get through the 3D and the processing, but we also believe that just through the high grading and the inventory and the quality of the prospects, we can grow that free cash flow and grow that investment in Egypt simultaneously. And if you look back to the last four years and if I take you back to 2014, we are running 28 rigs in Egypt, so we got down to a handful. We've been running about 12, 12 rigs. And really over that time period there's two discoveries Pithom and Berenice, which enabled us to keep Egypt pretty flat at 340,000 BOEs a day on the gross side. So with the new seismic and the new acreage we’re optimistic that there will be several new types of areas like that will let us put more capital in and that efficiency will help us drive more cash flow and help really change the trajectory in Egypt. 
David Deckelbaum : But that's not necessarily embedded into that ‘20 and ‘21 capital programs?
John Christmann: Not at this point.
David Deckelbaum : Allocation is more similar, okay.
John Christmann: Not at this point. 
David Deckelbaum : And my second question is just, when we go back to some of the conversations you were having around spacing and particularly in Alpine High, and if you guys could revisit some of the results from the Blackfoot pad. I know you talked about it last quarter just the spacing at 660 and developing long and wider spacing with larger fracs. So can you talk to us a bit about your learnings there and what you think it means for how you are going to space the wells in that Northern Flank?
John Christmann: Well, I mean what we've done is we were pretty, we were sticklers on keeping our frac, I'll call it frac jobs similar, so we know what the rock was telling us, and what we learned at the Blackfoot pad is we placed 12 Woodford wells and a half section there were Woodford day 4Bs and 4Cs and we used the same recipe we have been using because we were trying to understand the inter-related most of it. And what we learned there as we would likely can get away with 4As and 4Bs on 660 with those size frac jobs, but we also wanted to test the Mont Blanc, a little wider spacing and a little larger frac jobs, and we will measure those as the flow back over time. I mean what's important everybody gets dialed in on 30 day IPs and you have to look at how wells perform over 3, 6, 9 months, 12 months and I think what you'll see is us probably going a little wider. You're going to see multiple landing zones in the Woodford and larger fracs, some combination in there and that's part of the learning process that we've gone through in the Midland Basin. And as Tim pointed out that's why you're starting to see those same results come through as we continue to very scientifically evaluate every well in our patterns and are doing this in a way designed that’s going to drive improved productivity and capital efficiency. 
Operator: And this concludes our Q&A session. I'll now turn the call back to John Christmann for closing remarks. 
John Christmann: We appreciate all of you for joining us today. And I like to leave you with three key takeaways from the call. First, the world has changed significantly since our last quarterly earnings call. The drop in oil prices necessitates conservative budgeting and capital management. Apache is currently delivering attractive returns and growth rates and can achieve cash flow neutrality and sustain production inclusive of our very strong dividend down to about $45 WTI oil using some fairly conservative assumptions. Second, in 2019, year-over-year, we will sustain relatively flat production internationally and generate approximately 15% growth in the US with our capital heavily concentrated on two programs: oil growth in the Midland and Delaware basins and rich gas development at Alpine High.  And lastly, we have entered 2019 with very good momentum and expect to enter 2020 in a even stronger position. As a result, we plan to sustain at least mid single-digit 4Q to 4Q exit rate growth through 2021 at $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion annual spending. Growth will come from a balanced program of Alpine rich gas development in Midland, Delaware oil with significant upside potential from our exploration portfolio including our US onshore unconventional, Egypt and eventually Suriname. Thank you and we look forward to sharing our ongoing progress in the future. 
Operator: Ladies and gentleman, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Lisa and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Gary Clark, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Good morning and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation's Third Quarter 2018 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. We will begin the call today with an overview by Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann. Tim Sullivan, Executive Vice President of Operations Support, will then provide additional operational color. Steve Riney, Executive Vice President and CFO, will summarize our third quarter financial performance. Also available on the call to answer questions are Apaches Senior Vice Presidents: Brian Freed, Midstream and Marketing; Mark Meyer, Energy Technology, Data Analytics and Commercial Intelligence; and Dave Pursell, Planning Reserves and Fundamentals. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 25 minutes in length, with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunctions with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our third quarter Financial and Operational Supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website, at investor.apachecorp.com. On today's conference call we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt's tax barrels. Finally, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call today, I will discuss Apache's strategic positioning, provide a preview of 2019, comment on our strong third quarter performance and review our key focus areas. Apache is a very different and much improved company from four years ago when oil prices began their prolonged downturn in the fall of 2014. We acknowledged very early on that the industry including Apache needed to make significant changes, not only in terms of reducing activity levels and overall cost structure, but equally to reestablish long-term returns discipline in the capital program. At that time, we chose to significantly curtail our drilling program, allowing production to decline rather than pursue growth in an environment where commodity prices and costs were not properly aligned. We refrained from participating in high-cost acreage acquisitions in the heart of proven plays, choosing instead to build our unconventional exploration capabilities An important outcome of this strategy was the discovery of Alpine High. We have frequently stated our philosophy that an E&P company should be capable of living within cash flow from operations, generating sustainable long-term reserve and production growth while also returning capital to shareholders. After significant upfront investment at Alpine High and the pending completion of our Altus Midstream transaction, Apache has turned the corner and is well positioned to deliver on this philosophy for many years to come. We continue to generate steady production growth on a flat activity set and are poised to deliver positive free cash flow in 2019. This can be sustained over the long term through development of our extensive inventory. It will be supplemented by organic exploration, including discoveries in hand today, and a refreshed portfolio of new opportunities. Lower F&D costs, increasing returns and continual portfolio hydrating will accompany our growth and drive sustainable shareholder value growth through time. This is the investment proposition Apache offers and it is one that we strongly believe in, as evidenced by our decision to begin repurchasing shares in September under an existing authorization. Recently, our Board of Directors approved a new authorization for the repurchase of 40 million shares, which represents more than 10% of shares outstanding. Now I would like to provide a preview of 2019. For more than a year, Apache has operated at a relatively constant upstream activity level, which has enabled us to deliver operational efficiencies, effectively control costs and generate sustainable liquids production growth. We anticipate maintaining a similar activity level next year, but on a lower capital budget. If changes in expected cash flow dictate, we have the flexibility to reduce our activity levels accordingly. In 2019, assuming commodity prices in line with the current strip, Apache expects upstream capital investment of approximately $3 billion, which is consistent with our current guidance and is lower than 2018. Adjusted production at the high end of our 410,000 to 440,000 BOEs per day guidance range, representing more than 15% growth in the U.S. and 10% growth overall, positive free cash flow and continued return of capital to shareholders. This is well-aligned with the philosophy I outlined at the beginning of the call and we look forward to providing a more detailed 2019 outlook in February. Our performance-to-date in 2018 underpins our confidence in this outlook, as we have demonstrated excellent growth and exceeded our guidance for three consecutive quarters. In the third quarter, we delivered very strong earnings and cash flow, driven by our significant Brent and LLS oil price leverage, robust NGL realizations and solid production results. We've seen our positive production trends continue into the fourth quarter and are again raising our full-year 2018 U.S. guidance. Notably, we expect a meaningful increase in fourth quarter oil volumes. Internationally, we delivered robust cash flow in the third quarter of production that was in line with guidance. In Egypt, our drilling program continued to achieve a high success rate and gross production remains relatively steady. While net adjusted production was reduced by the impact of higher oil prices, on our production-sharing contracts, cash flow trended higher in the third quarter on strong Brent oil prices. In the North Sea, production was impacted by routine seasonal maintenance, but was also in line with expectations. We anticipate significant growth in the fourth quarter, with positive momentum continuing into 2019. Turning now to Midstream. We achieved an important milestone during the third quarter, with the announcement of Altus Midstream Company. Altus accomplishes the primary objectives that we have previously articulated to the market; it enables Apache to maintain control of the midstream infrastructure buildout and establishes an entity capable of funding all future midstream investments at a lower cost of capital. Since the announcement, we have spoken with many of our largest institutional shareholders. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and we look forward to the closing of the transaction in November. Now I would like to provide a strategic overview of Apache's key operating areas. In the Midland and Delaware Basins, the strategic testing we have conducted over the past three years is paying dividends, as we shift a much greater percentage of our capital to full-pattern development. This is generating significant improvements in cost and productivity. And today we believe that we are drilling some of the best wells in both basins. In the Midland Basin, development drilling continues in the Powell, Wildfire and Azalea areas with excellent results. We recently expanded our activity outside of these areas as we focus on increasing Apache's inventory of high-graded opportunities. In the Delaware Basin, we are delineating acreage in the New Mexico Slope play and adding landing zones in our Dixieland and Pecos Bend areas in Texas. Our drilling inventory in these areas continues to increase and will support a multi-rig program for the foreseeable future. Moving on to Alpine High. While testing and delineation activity will continue for some time, given the magnitude of the total resource, we are transitioning now to a multi-well pad development designed to optimize spacing, pattern and completions configurations. We have previously discussed the framework for monitoring our progress at Alpine High in the context of well costs, well productivity and inventory. On well costs, we have achieved an approximate 25% reduction in drilling, completion and equipment costs per lateral foot year-over-year through the first three quarters of 2019, which is in line with our goal. In terms of well productivity, we are beginning to extend our laterals where applicable, and we are seeing a high correlation between productivity and lateral length in our Woodford and Barnett wells. We are also beginning to modify completions design, including higher profit loads, which is delivering a step change in well productivity. Turning to our delineation program in the shallow Wolfcamp Bone Spring sequence formations, we recently began flow back on a 10 well pad which incorporates larger frac geometries and is designed to test the productivity of patterns and spatial relationship. The pad is developing roughly a half section and contains four wells in the Wolfcamp A, four wells in the Wolfcamp B and two wells in the Bone Spring formation. Aggregate production from the eight Wolfcamp wells is currently around 3,300 barrels of oil per day. We are very encouraged by the performance of these wells, which are still cleaning up and have not reached peak IP rates. We are in the early stages of bringing the two Bone Spring wells online and will provide an update on the progress of this pad in the future. Tim will provide some more detail on our Alpine High program in his remarks. Turning now to the international region. In Egypt, we have been investing at a pace that has maintained gross production at a relatively flat level. Our drilling success rate is very high and very consistent, while our inventory of opportunities is growing significantly through the addition of new acreage concessions and high density 3-D imaging. Egypt delivered some of the best returns in the portfolio, and we are confident this region can return to growth in production of free cash flow for many years to come. Our current drilling program in the North Sea consists of two platform rigs and one semi-submersible, which we believe is an appropriate pace to deliver our strategic objective of sustaining production and free cash flow generation. Capital efficiency has improved significantly in the North Sea and we anticipate delivering higher production in the fourth quarter and in 2019 with a flat capital profile. Production growth will be driven by the tie-in of three significant wells in the barrel area: a development well at Caliber, a discovery well at Store (11:46) and our discovery well at Garten, which we have now accelerated into 2018. Longer-term, the Garten discovery has lowered the risk profile of several analogous exploration prospects, some of which we will likely test in 2019. Moving on to exploration. In Suriname, we continue to progress our technical evaluation and are looking at a multitude of prospects. We will initiate a drilling program next year on Block 58, where Apache currently owns 100%. This block is untested and adjacent to the Exxon Mobil operated Stabroek Block in neighboring Guyana. In the U.S. we have a strategy of expanding our portfolio through organic growth opportunities at a low entry cost. On-shore unconventional exploration teams are acquiring acreage in multiple respective areas focusing on oil. Our third and fourth quarter capital reflects some incremental activity in this regard. Before turning it over to Tim, I'd would like to address reports that Apache is actively marketing certain assets in our U.S. portfolio. We regularly review the strategic value of holding assets in our portfolio. If another party is willing to fund assets that are not attracting capital for Apache and an opportunity exists to increase value for our shareholders through a sale, our approach has always been to notify the market upon execution of a sale agreement for any material asset disposition and refrain from commenting prior to that. To the extent we do complete asset sales, return of capital to shareholders is a high priority use of proceeds. With that, I will turn the call over to Tim Sullivan who will provide some operational details on the quarter.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Good morning. My remarks will briefly cover third quarter 2018 production and operations performance, including drilling highlights and activity in our core regions. Operationally, we had another very good quarter and saw improvement in many key areas. We achieved company-wide adjusted production of approximately 401,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 13% increase from the same period a year ago and up 3% from the second quarter 2018. The Permian Basin continues to drive our growth. Compared with the third quarter a year ago, oil production in the basin increased 16% and total production grew 38%. These are impressive growth rates on a large production base, which reflect the success of our ongoing development in the Midland and Delaware Basins and the continued ramp up at Alpine High. We averaged 18 rigs and five frac crews in the Permian Basin during the quarter. Compared with the preceding period, we held our oil production steady, up 1%, and with the completion schedule skewed toward the back half of the year, there will be a larger contribution to oil growth in the fourth quarter and even more so in 2019. In the Midland Basin, we placed 13 wells online in the third quarter, all of which were on multiwell pads. This includes a nine-well pad at our Powell field, comprising a mix of mile-and-a-half and two-mile laterals. In addition, we drilled a four-well strategic plan pad in our Hartgrove field in Reagan County, testing four separate Wolfcamp landing zones with very encouraging results. In the Delaware Basin at Dixieland, we placed on production 10 high-rate wells with one-mile laterals. Eight are producing from two proven-Upper Wolfcamp landing zones, while the remaining two successfully tested two additional landing zones in the Lower Wolfcamp, adding inventory across the field. Please refer to the Quarterly Supplement for production details. Production at Alpine averaged approximately 49,000 BOE per day during the quarter. We are currently producing approximately 55,000 BOE per day on a net basis. For the full year 2018, we are tracking toward 44,000 BOE per day net, down slightly from our 45,000 BOE per-day guidance. This reduction results primarily from a processing upset that sent moisture down the pipeline, requiring a two-day field shutdown to dig the lines. At Alpine High, we placed 27 wells on production during the third quarter. We will remain on track to place more than 90 wells on production this year. John mentioned the results we've seen thus far on our 10-well Cypress pad, so I will note a few other results year. Recent Barnett completions during the quarter include the Mohican 201, which averaged a 30-day initial production rate of 7.7 million cubic feet of rich gas and 319 barrels of oil per day; the (16:30), which averaged a 30-day IP rate of 7.3 million cubic feet of rich gas and 256 barrels of oil per day. Both wells were completed with laterals averaging 5,700 feet and standard proppant loads of 1,970 pounds per foot. They produce extremely rich gas with an average BTU content of nearly 1,300. And assuming cryo-processing, we yield up to 160 barrels of NGLs per million cubic feet of gas. We have many analogous Barnett wells scheduled for multi-well pad development in our 2019 drilling program. I also wanted to provide an update on the 12-well Blackfoot pad which we discussed last quarter. Recall that the Blackfoot tested 660-foot spacing in three Woodford landing zones. These wells were relatively small completions, treated with only 1,600 pounds per foot of sand. The pad peaked at a 30-day IP rate of nearly 105 million cubic feet of gas and 280 barrels of oil per day following our last quarterly call. The majority of the gas is being recovered from the upper two Woodford landing zones. Based on our frac geometry and production results, we believe we can recover most of these reserves with fewer wells and larger fracs, which will significantly enhance pad economics. This strong performance from the upper Woodford landing zones on tighter spacing has a positive impact on our location count. On the cost side, Apache is successfully navigating a challenging inflationary environment in the U.S. Our initial 2018 budget contemplated a 10% to 15% average surface cost increase. However, steel tariffs, rising fuel and chemical prices and higher labor costs, particularly trucking and construction, have resulted in incremental inflation. We are managing these dynamics with improved wellbore and completion designs, longer laterals, multi-well pad drilling and proactive investment in water management infrastructure. As we look into 2019, we are likely to see a continuation of higher labor, steel, fuel and chemical costs. However, as we move through the tender process, we are realizing reduce costs for rigs and pressure pumping crews. Net-net, we believe these cost trends roughly offset each other in 2019, and we plan to budget for a relatively flat or slightly down year-over-year service cost overall. Internationally, in Egypt we drilled and completed 24 gross wells with an 83% success rate. Noteworthy results are included in our Supplement. These are primarily high rate oil wells, all with Brent Index pricing. Our seismic acquisition on the Western Desert continues. To date, we have acquired close to 1 million acres of a planned 2.6 million acre seismic shoot, completing acquisition in our legacy West Kalabsha and Shushan areas. We have recently initiated seismic acquisition in our new Northwest Razzak Concession. Fast track processing is bringing very exciting results. We are seeing faults in geologic surfaces, especially in the deeper section, that we could not image before. We have identified several new leads and prospects just from this initial data review. Moving to the North Sea, production averaged approximately 51,000 BOE per day per the quarter as operations were impacted by maintenance turnarounds. Production has begun to rebound in the fourth quarter and should continue to ramp up. In late September we brought onstream our fourth development well at our Callater Field at Beryl. This well is having a positive impact both on production and reserves and is currently producing 3,500 BOE per day net to Apache. Apache owns a 55% working interest. Also, as John noted, we have accelerated development at Garten. The Beryl near field discovery we announced in March with first oil expected later this month. By locating this test well near existing infrastructure, we have been able to reduce our cycle time, minimize development costs and bring this well into production in only seven months for $80 million, which we expect will translate to a very attractive F&D cost of less than $10 per barrel. We anticipate achieving our highest average production rate for the year in that North Sea during the fourth quarter. To sum up, operationally, we remain on track for a very good year with growing momentum heading into 2019. We are focused on building on this success in quarters ahead. I will now turn the call over to Steve.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Tim. As noted in the press release issued last night, under generally accepted accounting principles, Apache reported third quarter 2018 net income of $81 million or $0.21 per diluted common share. Results for the quarter included a number of items that are outside of core earnings, which are typically excluded by the investment community and published earnings estimates. The most significant of these is a $75 million after-tax loss we incurred as a result of the bond tender exercise in August. Excluding this and other smaller items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $244 million or $0.63 per share. Third quarter financial performance was good across the board. Production volumes were strong and we anticipate this will continue into fourth quarter and 2019. Our average realized oil price exceeded $69 per barrel in the third quarter as nearly 70% of oil production received Brent or Gulf Coast linked pricing. NGL realizations were also very strong, up 18% from second quarter. Costs continue to trend well both on a per unit basis for LOE and DD&A and on a gross basis for G&A and exploration expense. All are tracking below previous full-year guidance ranges, which we have reduced accordingly. Note that cash tax guidance has been increased for the year to reflect higher income levels internationally, primarily as a result of the strong Brent oil prices. Capital investment in the quarter was $966 million dollars, which includes $122 million for Alpine High and Midstream. As highlighted in our financial and operational supplement, upstream activity level for the prior four quarters have been remarkably consistent. Upstream capital investment has averaged between $700 million and $750 million per quarter on a steady global rig count. We plan to maintain a similar level of baseline activity through 2019 resulting in typical quarterly capital investment of around $750 million. As John indicated, this would result in a $3 billion capital program for 2019. We believe this is a prudent level of investment and remain prepared to reduce it further should industry conditions warrant. Through a combination of the timing of capital activity and some incremental lease acquisitions and extensions, third quarter upstream investment was $844 million. Fourth quarter upstream investment will be approximately $800 million, which also includes some significant lease acquisition investments. With the combination of strong operational performance and recent price levels, financial returns have improved and will continue to do so. Our cash return on invested capital through the first three quarters of 2018 was 23% on an annualized basis. We ended the third quarter with $593 million of cash on hand. In terms of balance sheet management, in the third quarter we took certain steps to improve our debt portfolio. We issued $1 billion of new 10-year senior notes, repurchased $731 million of outstanding debt and paid off $400 million of maturing debt. These actions extended our debt maturity profile, reduced our average cost of debt, modernized our standard debenture terms, and reduced debt by $131 million. This is in addition to the $150 million debt reduction we affected earlier in the year. I will conclude with comments on midstream and marketing. There continue to be many concerns about transport, and now fractionation capacity to accommodate growing Permian Basin production volumes. For the upstream industry in general, these concerns are well-founded, and the underlying situation is likely to extend through much of 2019. The good news is that much of the Midstream investment is already underway, and Apache has taken the necessary steps to mitigate the short-term impact of these issues. As an interim solution, we entered into swaps on Waha gas basis back in late 2017 and early 2018 to lock in an average $0.51 differential on a significant quantity of gas production through much of 2019. As a part of the longer-term solution, Apache's midstream business is contracted for transport on multiple pipeline projects across all three commodities. In many cases, our contracting was critical to enabling FID on the project. As such, the midstream business was able to secure equity participation options in those projects and will become an important piece of Altus Midstream Company. We have talked extensively about the gas and oil transport projects. With the recent concerns around NGL transport and fractionation, let me share a few more details on our agreement with Enterprise. This agreement will accommodate NGL transport and fractionation, ramping up to 205,000 barrels per day, beginning with the commissioning of the Chinook NGL Pipeline Waha lateral. The agreement has a 10-year primary term with a very attractive fixed transport and fractionation fee structure. At Apache's option, the agreement can be extended under the same terms for two additional five-year periods of time. The pipeline's lateral is anticipated to be operational shortly after the completion of the first Cryo facility at Alpine High. We are currently with working with Enterprise and other parties on interim solutions in the event the Cryo facility is operational before the pipeline lateral is commissioned. The Enterprise agreement will access attractive Mont Belvieu pricing for our NGLs and contains certain options that enable further margin expansion possibilities. In 2019, the value of the NGL margin uplift for Alpine High will become much more apparent. We are closing out 2018 and entering 2019 in a very strong financial position and with great momentum: lower debt, robust cash flow and increasing returns, all goals we set at the beginning of the year. I look forward to reporting on our full-year financial performance in February and further discussing our outlook for 2019. And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. We'll pause for just a moment to compile a Q&A roster. And our first question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson from Stevens. Your line is open.
Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC: Good morning, everybody. You guys had really strong Permian NGL price realizations this quarter. I was curious, what percent of your Permian NGLs are ethane? And then how is that to change post the Cryo facilities coming online in Alpine next year?
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Hey, Gail. So this is Steve. So I don't have at hand an exact number of the percent of NGLs that are ethane. Might see if we could get that before the end of this call. But that obviously will be impacted quite a bit as we actually bring on three Cryo units in Alpine in 2019, the first one by the middle of the year and then two more before the end of the year. In aggregate, we produce about 60,000 barrels a day of NGLs in the U.S. and most of those – those are all basically priced based on net back Mont Belvieu type of pricing, with a deduction for transportation and fractionation costs. And quick turnaround on the first part, about 42% is F8 in the Permian.
Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC: Okay. Great. And then the market we tend to be overly focused on your U.S. onshore execution, but you have some really high-quality international assets. Can you just talk about what could potentially be on the horizon in the North Sea and Egypt in 2019, specifically maybe in Egypt as maybe you return that asset more to a global asset.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yes, Gail. Thank you. If you look at Egypt, we've got a big three-day program that's underway and we've got a lot of new concessions, and so, it's a 2.6 million acre shoot. We shot over 1 million of it. Things are progressing well and, I tell you, the early looks on the seismic are very exciting. There's just a lot of rock to deal with out there, it's high productivity, and we've got such a massive infrastructure, backbone in place, that it will be easy to bring things on. So, we are very excited about Egypt and we are excited about getting more of the 3-D in and starting to migrate our inventory there, which really has become very robust. Historically we have about two years of inventory that we could see because it took so long to build. Today we've got a much, much longer time horizon on our Egypt portfolio, and gives us the ability – you know, we believe we are going to be able to grow the free cash flow as well is grow production over the next several years on the new acreage. So that's the first thing. If you look at the track record in the North Sea, Garten this year was a big discovery for us, and as we said on the notes this morning, we are going to be accelerating that from early next year into the fourth quarter. So we are excited about that. It will be a very high rate well, it's a big structure, and there's potential in there, we'll just have to see how it outperforms, even add more wells. But most importantly, it also de-risked several other structures that are very similar to Garten. So we continue to have success in the barrel area with tiebacks. We've got store coming as well, in 2019 we brought on another well in Callater. So we've got a lot of momentum going into 2019 in the North Sea, not to mention the work we are doing a 40s as well with the water injection. We are really starting to see some stabilization of the decliner rates there, and flattening of that which has big ramifications. So, you know international portfolio has provided a tremendous amount of cash flow, it's Brent pricing and we get really high gas prices in the UK as well, and we're excited what that's going to continue to do for us for the foreseeable future.
Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC: Great. Thank you so much.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your line is open.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good morning, John, to you and your whole team there.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Good morning, Charles.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: I wanted to – I feel like you guys talked a little bit about that para sequence test you have, and I think Tim said that was the Cyprus state pad, did I catch that right?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: You did.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Okay. And so, John, I recognize it's early days there, but can you give a little bit more color. I know you said the wells are still cleaning up. I did a quick math and it looks like those four Wolfcamp tests are right now a little bit over 400 barrels a day of oil each. I wonder if you would talk about how much water you are seeing? Where you think that, what would be a good result in your view on where those wells go? And also maybe you could talk a little bit about the decision to do all eight wells at onetime, rather than just kind of weigh generally into that test?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, first of all, Charles, we are very excited about it. It's a 10 well oil pad test. There are four Wolfcamp A's, there are four Wolfcamp B's and two Bone Springs. Really, really high productivity. It's very early. I will tell you we were gas lifting all eight of the Wolfcamp wells. There's extreme deliverability and productivity and they are really just starting to cleanup. So, they started cutting oil pretty early. There's a tremendous amount of fluid to move, and we are very optimistic and encouraged by those. They are still short laterals, larger fracs, about 4000 pounds a foot. This is really 10 wells in a little over a half section. So it's like we've talked about the name of the game is getting the pad development, understanding the spacing from a spatial and pattern position. And we're excited about these. They are going to continue to clean up, when we look at the IPR curves, there's a lot of room for these wells come up and we expect them to hold in for quite a while. So we're very encouraged. The two Bone Springs we've just really started and we've run sump pumps in those two wells. So – and they're both cutting oil but just really getting started. So it's early and is 40 gravity oil, it's black oil and well costs were very reasonable for the size jobs we pumped, and we're very optimistic.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it. It sounds promising. We'll just have to stay tuned on that. And then if I could go back and touch on – you guys talked about the CapEx outlook for 2019, but that's really a piece of the free cash flow outlook for 2019. And you guys also talked about the possibility of asset sales, and that would be the scenario which you'd look to return more cash to shareholders. So I think you guys already have a dividend. You've maintained it through the whole downturn, but can you give us a little bit of your thoughts? Are you thinking about, how would you – if you did have more free cash flow through an asset sale or just through sustained strength in quality price, how are you thinking about maintaining or increasing your dividend going with a special dividend? And then also, you guys announced this $40 million share repurchase authorization. Can you give us how those priorities sort out in your mind?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, Charles, that's a lot of questions. I'll try to summarize in a couple points and then give you a chance to come back if we didn't answer them. But first of all, as we look to 2019, we've been running a pretty flat activity set, going back to the back half of 2017. So we're very comfortable what the capital forecast is going into next year. We figure for $3 billion, we can deliver pretty fat flat activity set, which sets us up very nicely when you look at the corporate level in the U.S. growth which, of course will be driven by Permian. So we also believe that we will be in a position to generate some free cash flow and clearly, a high priority with that free cash flow right now, especially with where share price is would be to supplement our dividend policy which we've maintained through the downturn. I mean we're one of the few that did not cut our dividend, and so we see that buybacks is something we can do to supplement our dividend policy as we return incremental cash flow to the shareholders. So everything I'll say about the capital program going into next year that can easily be flexed up as we have significant inventory to do that. But also it'll be very easy ratchet back if things change in the environment. So we'll have more color on the call in February, but very comfortable with the rates and pace we've been running at. I think we're set up for a really strong 2019 after a really good 2018, and we do see us being able to increase the stuff back to shareholders.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Thanks, John. That was the overview I was looking for. Go ahead. I'm sorry.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah, sorry, Charles. I'll just add to that. Just in terms of what potential we might have on that, we ended the third quarter with $600 million of cash, with positive free cash flow planned at strip for 2019. Through the end of 2019 and after paying the dividend and after retaining a bit of cash on the balance sheet for operational purposes, you're probably looking at as much as $500 million to $1 billion of cash available, depending on price, available for either debt reduction or further share buybacks. And that would exclude any proceeds from asset sales.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Wanted to touch on Alpine High well productivity. You talked to some of the success and endeavors you're taking, extending laterals and also greater proppant loads. Can you add a little bit more color on what you're seeing, and more specifically whether when you talk about the improvement in productivity that is increasing EURs in recovery rates, or that is just bringing forward production?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Yeah, Brian. I think the thing we've determined and we now have substantial flow time on it is that the larger fracs are definitely increasing productivity. We're also seeing that in the Woodford and the Barnett, and longer laterals are pretty much one to-one in terms of lateral foot for the productivity. So in both cases we're getting benefit from longer laterals as well as the bigger fracs. The last pad we brought on, the Blackfoot, was the smaller fracs. We did that even knowing going into that we knew the larger fracs were doing more but we needed to see the data point in terms of the number of landing zones and the spatial placement between those. And it's confirmed what we believed that we're probably going to be able to develop at Woodford with two landing zones, drop the As and Bs a little bit lower with a little larger fracs. And then we've got to come back and pump the bigger fracs on those to then figure out the optimal number of wellbores. But the good news is our location counts have had very conservative assumptions. We've proven that at less than 2,000 pounds we can place the wells 660 feet apart and our well count assumptions were 925 to 1,000. So well count is going to go up when we come back and quantify that, but we've still got some more work to do in terms of what's going to drive the greatest return and PV per capital dollar invested with how we develop these patterns. We've got the 12 wells in the Blackfoot. We're going to come back right now. We're in the process of completing 10 wells in the Barnett and at a later date you'll see us come back with a pair sequence. So at the Mont Blancs right now we're in the process of flowing back or starting to flow back some Woodford and Barnett tests, which have a little larger fracs. So there's a lot of data that's coming and has been designed to help us yield what's going to be critical to the development scenario. So a lot of good work and a lot of progress, and at some point we'll come back and unfold a lot of that for you.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you for that. And then my follow up is with regards to use of capital Permian and M&A. Can you just kind of talk to, to what degree M&A opportunities are competitive or not competitive relative to share repurchase for use of free cash and where the Permian outside Alpine High plays into that if at all?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean, I think if you look at us today first of all, as I said in the closing part of my comments, if there's an asset that we're not funding and there's an opportunity for somebody else to put capital in that asset, then there may be an arbitrage and the ability to create some value for shareholders. So we're constantly looking at the portfolio and you've seen that historically with us. We exited Canada last year. So it's something we're constantly looking at. Clearly, right now, if you look at our portfolio, we're very excited about where we are in the Midland Basin. We've been predominantly working three areas and, as Tim mentioned, we branched out past those three areas in the Permian. But if you look at those three areas, it's less than 20% of what we'd call our core Midland Basin acreage and we've really developed less than 20% of the locations we see in those. So there's tremendous amount of running room in our Wolfcamp and Spraberry locations in our Midland Basin. And then if you look at our portfolio from an expiration standpoint, we believe today you're better served – the best impact's going to be through organic well-designed expiration. And Alpine High was a result of that. We've put together a tremendous portfolio over the last few years on the conventional side. We've got a block down in Suriname that we're very, very excited about and we've also got some new plays that we've been working on the unconventional side. As you know, it's a depleting business and you have to continue to find areas, and we think organically through the expiration if you can do it with low-cost, high-impact areas, we think that's the best way to create value. And it's also why we also like our share price right now.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin from Société Générale. Your line is open.
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC: Yes. Thanks. Just one quick one for me. Are you going to be buying puts for next year's oil production?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: John, historically we've put things in place to protect our programs. And I think fundamentally we like to stay away from hedging unless we feel like we need to do something. And at times when we felt like we had a capital program like the midstream and Alpine High we've done things to protect that cash flow or through acquisitions there's ways to fund those. So I think as we go into 2019 we're in a position today where with the capital program, we can ratchet that up or down if necessary. So it's just something we'll have to kind of look at.
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC: Okay. No, that's fine. I didn't figure you'd be putting any on, but I was just asking. And then Altus closes this month, end of month, mid-month, or...
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Yeah. I'll let Brian...
Brian W. Freed - Apache Corp.: Yeah, this is Brian. The proxies were mailed out on October 22 and we've got the Shareholder Meeting scheduled for November 6 with the close and funding scheduled for November 9, and at that point in time the ticker symbol will change to ALTM and the name will change at closing to Altus Midstream from Kayne Anderson Acquisition Company.
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. John, I wonder if you could help me with really a bit of a production visibility question for next year, and it's really about how we should think about the fractionation start-ups and how we could see your liquids yield evolve from the wet gas you've got currently. Because, obviously, that's going to be a pretty significant catalyst, I think, for your step change in cash flow as you go over the next year or so.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Yeah, I think, Doug, clearly 2019 will be an inflection-point year for the NGLs at Alpine High. If you look at 2018 to 2020, we showed a transition where our NGLs would grow from 10% in 2018 to 30% in 2020. We've got one Cryo coming on in the second half – or the back end of the first half of the year. Then, we got two coming on in the second half. So, it'll all happen, kind of start happening second and third quarter of next year.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah. And, Doug, I'd just add to that. Our contract with Enterprise provides for a ramp-up of volumes to 205,000 barrels a day and that's a fixed contract. They've got to take it. It's a fixed-fee structure for transportation and fractionation. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we actually have some options to even further enhance margins beyond just a Mont Belvieu mixed NGL barrel pricing netted back to Alpine High.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Steve, just to be clear, when would you expect to fill that capacity? I know it's a bit of a stretch question, but can you provide any visibility as when you would expect that volume to be achieved?
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: No. Not at this time, Doug. I think what I'd recommend is let's wait until the next plan rollout in February and we could probably have a better view of that kind of stuff. But, obviously, I'll just state the obvious and that is as we – we're bringing on three Cryo facilities in 2019, two more in 2020. That won't be the end of it. But, obviously, as we bring on Cryo facilities, the goal would be to have a drilling schedule that fills those as quickly as possible.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. My follow-up, John, I don't know how you want to deal with this one. It's on Egypt. It's about, I guess, seven or eight years now since everything kind of went toes up in the country and things have changed dramatically, as you know. I'm just curious, we haven't really had a formal update on your plans for Egypt with the new seismic program and so on. The visibility for the sustaining business sort of growth plan going forward. And it strikes me that the market could probably benefit from getting a refresh on that. I'm just wondering if you can update. Do you have any intention of doing that and any high-level plans that you can share as you think about the next several years?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean, if you look back, we've been able to maintain our Egypt production level with a much lower rig count. We were running 28 rigs in Egypt in 2014 and we got down as low as six or seven. We've been running around 12 rigs, and we've been able to really stabilize that, and that's with the (48:22) starting to get towards the point where it would go on decline. So we've done a really, really good job. And I think our productivity and capital efficiency in Egypt has gone up significantly, and that was really two discoveries Ptah and Berenice, which helped drive that, which we had in early 2015. If you look at the new seismic, I think, as we – with the new concessions, and we get the new seismic back, we would be in a position, Doug, to kind of unfold some of that as well. So, we've expanded a lot over the last three years. We've landed a lot of acreage in Egypt. And as I mentioned earlier, we've got great infrastructure and a great track record. And so we look at Egypt as an area we can continue to grow the free cash flow. You can't underestimate what we've done with that and what it's been able to do for us over the last several years and grow our production. So Egypt's actually an improving position for us as well, and we've got better there over the last couple of years. And I think once we get the new seismic back, and then we would be in a position to unfold that a little.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just one closing comment from me, John, if I may. It's just an observation more than anything else. This asset obviously throws off a lot of free cash. The market still seems to apply a data discount to that asset. And if you could provide some visibility on the sustainability of that free cash, I think it would really pay dividends. That's really what I was getting at. So I appreciate your answer. Thanks.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: That's a great comment, Doug. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani from Nat Alliance. Your line is open.
Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities: Hey, guys. I wanted to dig into the forward plans at Altus a little bit. Obviously, I know the vote is a handful of days away. I guess you've got a central closing coming up soon as well. But assuming everything closes as planned, how do you see, sort of, the progress over the next couple of quarters? I know you guys have some significant options to purchase some equity interests and some rather large pipelines. I know you guys have talked about our other organic growth opportunities. Can you just, kind of, refresh everyone in terms of what you plan to do here in the short term when all this post close?
Brian W. Freed - Apache Corp.: Yeah, this is Brian Freed. I'll address that a little bit. I mean, quite frankly, what we have in front of us, we've got a lot to say grace over in front of us in terms of the work we've got in front of us. We've got the Cryos that John mentioned that need to come on in 2019 and the equity options that we will start exercising by the end of this year. We've got a supplement out on the website that shows when some of those option exercise dates are, so you can dig into the details there. So I won't burden this call with all of that. But we do expect to start exercising these options by the end of the year, and then we have a lot of gathering and processing to continue to build out through the rest of this year and into 2019 as well, too.
Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities: Okay. That's helpful. And I guess just jumping over to Suriname, obviously an area you guys are quite excited about here. I wanted to see if you could give us a little bit more color on, sort of, the capital plan there for 2019 in terms of how much money you plan to throw at it and how many potential wells you guys could drill.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean, it's a large area. We've got about 1.4 million acres. There are number of prospects that are very high quality. We will drill at least one well in 2019, and there will be options to make that program much larger. So that's one of the things we're looking at. But we'll include at least one well.
Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities: Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, is that well likely to, kind of, come by midyear? What can you tell us on timing there?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: I would – I'd probably say late second, early third quarter, likely, but...
Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities: Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis from Capital One Securities. Your line is open.
Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, John. Just a couple of questions on the exploration side. I know that's not a topic discussed all that much in E&P land these days. But regarding the planned Surinam well next year, how are you able to use that data from the other recent unsuccessful wells drilled offshore Surinam by all the operators? And then you had your own well there. How useful was that data in trying to plan your 2019 well?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean, I think if you go back and look at our Block 53, the two wells that we've drilled over the last, call it, three years, we've learned a lot from both of those. You look at 58, it's positioned differently. It's in a different part of what's a very large basin. It's a very large block, so we feel like that Block 58 is ideally positioned. And it really – the results outbound the Block 58 will not have an impact on our view of Block 58.
Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.: Okay. John. Thank you for that. And then just to continue with exploration, you talked a little bit about expiration potential in the portfolio. What areas globally look interesting to Apache at this point, either as operator or non-operator? And what percentage of the budget, as you start to generate the excess cash flow moving forward, 2019 plus, what percentage of the budget could expiration represent going forward?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, it's something you've got to keep in check. If you look on our international portfolio, of our international capital, we spend some expiration dollars in both the North Sea and in Egypt, right, so. And those are continual programs that we've had great results from, so there's a small portion there. Suriname is the one place outside where we operate today that we will be active next year. And then on the unconventional side, it's more you U.S. focused and it's more oil focused, and those are things where we don't spend a lot of money because we're looking at things that are off the radar from other companies where we think we can add value, pick up meaningful acreage positions at low cost that could have a really high impact. And so that's how we approached the unconventional side. But you've got to keep it in check. You've got to have the lion's share of your capital going into your development programs that are driving your returns and your volume growth and the cash flow.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: That's it for me. Thanks a bunch, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is open.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe following up a little bit on the last couple on Suriname and exploration. How are you thinking about ownership on that Block 58? You currently have 100% on it. Is that something you likely want to sell down? And is that probably something you'd do before, or would you wait for the results after the first test on that block?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Michael, it's something we own 100% today; there is quite a bit of interest in the block. And so that's just something we'd have seen the future.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Okay. Sounds like you're up for taking the full interest on the first well?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: We're definitely prepared. We like the risk to upside profile. Wells are not real expensive. You're probably $55 million to $60 million tops for one of the deeper water wells. So it's something we can easily do a couple wells on. So we'll just see. It's a block we are very excited about, and we'll just kind of see how it unfolds.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Okay. That makes sense. That's helpful. Thanks. And then I guess bigger picture, just thinking about the 2019 outlook relative to the kind of back half experience here in 2018. I know obviously, we've been – you've been executing on production, taking that up, pointing to the high-end of the 2019 production guide or prior guide. But at the same time, capital has also been moving higher in the last couple of quarters. How do we get comfortable with that planned ramp down and quarterly spending rate? What are the key drivers of giving you confidence in planning around that at this point?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Yeah, I'll let Steve give you some specifics. But if you look at our last six quarter, we've been running a pretty flat activity set. And if you look at the actual EMP capital, it's been pretty flat. I mean you saw little bit of a rise in the back half this year and that's been toward acreage, but I will let Steve give you little bit more color.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah, I think that's the story, Michael. I mean for four quarters in a row, leading up to third quarter, we've spent less than $750 million per quarter on upstream capital, if you just set aside the Midstream stuff and Alpine High. In the fourth quarter, of 2018, we've guided to $800 million, but $65 million of that is going to be exploration land acquisition, kind of a one-off land acquisition, so really we're under $750 million underlying kind of baseline upstream spending in the fourth quarter of 2018. The third quarter, there's a bit of a lumpiness to it. Again, there's about $800 million excluding land acquisitions in the third quarter, and that's just a bit of lumpiness, why that's over $750 million. There's a lot of lumpiness around activity on completions. Remember, we took the completion holiday and we had some backlog there. We upsized quite a number of those completions, so there's some lumpiness and some facility spending and some other type of stuff. So I would say that the exception was the third quarter at $800 million on an underlying baseline upstream spend rate as opposed to the second half. The other way to look at it is second half of 2018, we'll spend, in round numbers, $1.65 billion. We've got a little over $100 million of land acquisitions, lease extensions and acquisitions, so we're just – we're a little bit over $1.5 billion in the second half of 2018 and running at about $1.5 on a half year basis going into 2019. So I just, I think that the number in the third quarter was the anomaly and the exception. It's not underlying, we're spending at or even possibly slightly below for most of the last four quarters $750 million a quarter in the upstream. And we're not meaningfully changing activity levels here.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Okay. And I guess on that land acquisition site in the fourth quarter, that $65 million you highlighted, sorry if I missed, where is that roughly?
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: We have not, Michael, we have not disclosed that. It's part of our unconventional programs that would be areas that at some point in the future we would talk about.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: In the U.S....
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Some portion of that, Michael, is lease extensions ending and some of it is new lease acquisition.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. John Christmann.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, thank you all for joining us today. I would like to leave you with three key takeaways from today's call. First, Apache had an excellent quarter both operationally and financially. We significantly exceeded consensus earnings and cash flow estimates. We beat and raised our production guidance for the third quarter in a row and we outlined a strong 2019 view. Second, we are planning a year-over-year reduction in upstream capital in 2019 and upon closing, Altus Midstream will fund our Alpine High infrastructure spend. This creates good visibility to free cash flow for which a high priority will be share repurchases. And lastly, we are realizing significant benefits from our diversified portfolio and strong leverage to oil prices. In 2019, as we ramp are wet gas volumes at Alpine High in conjunction with Cryo installation, we will see a step function change in margins and cash flow from the play. I look forward to sharing our ongoing progress with you in the future.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Natalia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Please limit your questions to one question and a follow up. Thank you. I would now turn the call over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.
Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's second quarter 2018 financial and operational results conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann, Executive Vice President of Operations Support, Tim Sullivan, and Executive Vice President and CFO, Steve Riney. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 25 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our second quarter financial and operational supplement which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly-comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will begin with commentary on Apache's second quarter production results and our outlook for the second half of 2018. Then I will provide an overview of the progress we are making in our key regions. Tim Sullivan and Steve Riney will then provide some additional operational details and summarize our second quarter financial performance and guidance before turning it back to me for closing remarks and a comment on the status of our midstream transaction. 2018 has been a year of continued progress on important strategic initiatives and operational performance. On the operational side, we have made several significant advances including drilling efficiencies, strong operational runtime, base decline mitigation, new well outperformance and a step change reduction in Permian Basin completion costs and cycle times. All of these have contributed to our positive production trends year to date. This is most evident in our strong second quarter U.S. results, where solid execution and an increasing pace of activity enabled us to exceed guidance by 7,000 BOEs per day. The Permian Basin was the primary growth driver in the quarter with oil production in the Midland and Delaware basins up almost 6,000 barrels per day from the first quarter. As highlighted in last night's press release, based on this performance, we are raising our full year 2018 U.S. production guidance to 260,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and we are raising full year 2018 Permian Basin guidance to approximately 210,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Both of these are above the high end of our prior guidance, which was increased in May. In our international operations, second quarter production was roughly in line with expectations. We are updating full year 2018 guidance to approximately 134,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a previous range of 130,000 to 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Despite a relative limited capital expenditure program, we have made tremendous progress this year in preparation for long-term growth in Egypt and sustainability in the North Sea. As we look further ahead, our progress this year brings us significant upside bias to our 2019 and 2020 production guidance, both in the U.S. and internationally. We will provide more detailed updates on this in the coming months. During the first half of 2018, we invested $1.45 billion in our upstream operations and approximately $230 million at Alpine High midstream. We anticipate maintaining an investment pace in the second half of the year that will bring our full year 2018 capital outlook to approximately $3.4 billion versus our prior guidance of $3 billion. The majority of this incremental capital is being directed to the Permian Basin where we are increasing investment to align and optimize our drilling and completion programs. Production growth will be an outcome of this investment. However, the primary objective is to deploy capital in the most efficient manner and improve rates of return. I will discuss these points a bit more in my regional commentary. A combination of higher production volumes and higher than budgeted oil prices this year provides more than enough cash flow to fund the incremental capital. Moving now to region performance, beginning with the Permian Basin. In the Midland Basin we remain focused on pad development in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations. Results are exceeding expectations as strategic testing continues to enable efficient and optimize full field development. Apache continues to make great strides on capital efficiency. We have implemented a significant change in our Midland Basin completion program which is delivering a step function reduction in both costs and cycle times. This saves about $400,000 on the average completion and has reduced cycle times to the point where we need to rebalance our drilling rig to frac crew ratio. We addressed this in the immediate term with a temporary holiday in June and July for one frac crew. As that crew returns in the third quarter, we will also bring two additional drilling rigs into the Midland Basin to rebalance our drilling and completions pace. This will primarily benefit production volumes in 2019. Addition of these rigs is the most operationally efficient, cost-effective and return-maximizing approach to development. It represents a significant portion of our incremental capital investment this year. In the Delaware Basin outside of Alpine High, we are developing the Wolfcamp/Bone Spring formations in our Dixieland area and delineating acreage in a slope play further to the north. The strong well performance we are seeing from this program is also driving the need for incremental capital to expand production facilities. Turning now to Alpine High where progress towards a value optimized full field development program is continuing as planned. As we described in the February earnings call, our 2018 Alpine High drilling program consists of pad and pattern development tests, ongoing geographic delineation and some required acreage retention drilling. We have chosen to effect a more material transition from one and two well tests to larger pad drilling this year. This has created longer lead times to first production and a completion schedule that is weighted more heavily to the back half of the year, but it is clearly the most efficient way to deploy capital into the drilling program. It is also accelerating our learnings, which we are incorporating into full field development. We've spoken in previous quarters about evaluating our progress at Alpine High through a framework of well cost reductions, well productivity and inventory expansion. And I would like to update you on those now. Beginning with well costs. We continue to drive well costs down despite ongoing upward pressure on service costs. We previously stated our goal of reducing average drilling and completion costs by approximately 25% in 2018. Year-to-date, our average cost per treated lateral foot is down by approximately 25%, so we are on track to beat our goal. In terms of well productivity, the next phase of optimization at Alpine High is underway and involves testing spatial positioning within and between target intervals. We are also making tactical refinements to landing zone targeting drilling longer laterals where practical and increasing the use of larger stimulations based on positive results we have seen from tests conducted last year. Results from these optimization efforts have been very good, and you can see that in the productivity of some of our recent wells. We will have more to say about this in the future. Lastly, in terms of drilling inventory, our location count today stands at more than 5,000 wells. Landing zone and spacing tests thus far have confirmed that this inventory count is conservative based on original assumptions. We will update this inventory periodically as strategic testing and optimization progresses. We are moving up the learning curve quickly at Alpine High and the transition to more pad drilling is accelerating this process. In 2018, we plan to place approximately 90 wells on production. As I previously indicated, our completion schedule is back-end loaded this year and will result in a steep production ramp in 3Q and 4Q. This ramp is now well underway. At the end of July, net production at Alpine High was approximately 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing a nearly 70% increase from the second quarter average. For 2018, our Alpine High production is on track to achieve 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is the midpoint of our previous guidance range. The benefits of pad drilling coupled with continual progress on well costs and well productivity are driving a positive bias to our production outlook for next year. As a result, we anticipate that 2019 production from Alpine High will trend towards the high end of the 85,000 to 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day guidance range that was established back in February. Turning now to our international operations, beginning with Egypt. Apache continues to generate strong drilling results and maintain relatively flat gross production rates in Egypt. We recently added a third new concession consisting of 650,000 acres in the East Bahariya area, bringing our total Egypt footprint to more than 6 million acres. Activity has already begun on our new concession as we are currently drilling our first two wells and have planned drilling activity on all three concessions before year-end. Apache is the largest oil producer in Egypt and our objective is to grow production and free cash flow there for many years to come. In the North Sea, we had a good quarter despite fairly limited activity. We are currently running two platform rigs, one at Beryl, along with one floater, the Ocean Patriot, which recently reset to a substantially lower day rate. Given the timing of our capital spending and well completion cadence, we placed only one new well on production during the second quarter, which led to flat production in the North Sea. With the implementation of an integrated water flood management program, we are seeing improvements in our underlying base decline rate in the Forties field. It is still early, but there is tremendous potential for improved recovery from this massive oilfield. Every 1% improvement in EUR represents 50 million barrels. Looking ahead, our next development well at Callater is scheduled to be on production early in the fourth quarter and our initial well at Garten is expected early in the first quarter. These two high volume wells will bring a significant increase in oil production and provide tremendous momentum as we enter 2019. Before turning it over to Tim, I would like to conclude with a few brief comments on our exploration activities. In Suriname, we have ordered long lead items in preparation for initiating a drilling program at Block 58, which is on trend with recent industry discoveries offshore Guyana. We also have a portfolio of exploration projects in various stages of evaluation where we are seeking large scale highly economic opportunities in the Lower 48 consistent with our organic growth strategy. With that, I will turn the call over to Tim Sullivan, who will provide some operational details on the quarter.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Good morning. My remarks will briefly cover second quarter 2018 production and operations performance including drilling highlights and activity in our core regions. Operationally, we had a very good quarter and saw improvement in many key areas. We achieved second quarter company-wide adjusted production of approximately 390,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 16% increase from the same period a year ago and up 6% from the first quarter 2018. The Permian Basin remains the primary driver of our growth, where oil production increased 25% and total production grew 39% from the second quarter a year ago. These increases reflect the ongoing development of oil production in the Midland and Delaware Basins and the continued ramp up at Alpine High. We averaged 17 rigs and 4 frac crews in the Permian Basin during the quarter. In the Midland Basin we placed 22 wells online in the second quarter, all of which were on multi-well pads. Results are exceeding our expectations and the information we are gathering is critical to optimizing full field development plans. During the quarter, we drilled a number of notable pads, and I would refer you to our financial and operational supplement for more details on these results. Moving to the Delaware Basin and our Wolfcamp development in the Dixieland area, we placed on production 11 high-rate oil wells that are also in our supplement. We are seeing impressive results with only one mile laterals. We have two proven targets in the Upper Wolfcamp and plan to test two additional targets later this year. At Alpine High, our well connections are heavily weighted to the last seven months of the year. We have included a chart in our quarterly supplement that illustrates this cadence by month, which as John noted, will lead to a sharp production increase in the back half of the year. Also in our quarterly supplement, we have provided a slide that shows some impressive recent well results from key tests at Alpine High. Recent completions include a 12 well pad at Blackfoot, which is testing 660 foot spacing in three landing zones, all within the Woodford. The pad is currently flow testing 93,000,000 cubic feet of gas and 200 barrels of oil per day gross and is still improving as it continues to clean up. A three-well Woodford pad at Fox State testing longer laterals near the central crest with early flow back test rates of 19 million cubic feet and 321 barrel of oil per day gross and the Mohican #201, a Barnett wet gas test in the northern flank which recently flowed at 9.4 million cubic feet of gas and 420 barrels of oil per day. On the last call we noted the impressive production profile at our six-well Dogwood pad. This was our first multi-well development pad designed to assess down spacing potential at Alpine High. The Dogwood wells went online around the beginning of the year and continue to deliver at a stabilized gross rate of nearly 50 million cubic feet per day. This pad has been producing for more than 180 days with cumulative production of 11 Bcf, and we see no signs of interference. We believe that this performance on 660 foot spacing in the dry gas window has positive implications for future additional inventory in the source interval where we have assumed 800 to 1,000 foot spacing in our current location count. We continue to make progress on our cost reduction goals at Alpine High. In the northern flank and central crest, we are moving from single well appraisal drilling to pad development with a focus on cost reduction, lateral length and completion optimization to maximize net present value. For this year, we are targeting well costs below $1,380 per lateral foot, which is an approximate 25% reduction from 2017 costs. Our recent second quarter drilled and completed wells at Alpine High were ahead of target, averaging less than $1,260 per treated lateral foot. On the operating cost side, we are making great progress building out our water handling infrastructure. To supply our frac water needs, we have installed an extensive network of facilities throughout the northern half of Alpine High which significantly reduces our need for incremental new water sources and dramatically reduces our dependence on expensive trucking services. This includes 43 miles of water gathering and distribution facilities with five water recycling centers that are currently handling 90% of the produced water from Alpine High. During the second half of 2018, we plan to conduct tests in the southern flank of Alpine High to further delineate the play. Internationally, in Egypt we drilled and completed 35 gross wells with an 83% success rate. Noteworthy results are included in our supplement. These are high-rate oil wells with Brent index pricing. Our seismic acquisition in the western desert continues with the first surveys completed over the West Kalabsha and Shushan basins. To date, we've acquired close to 1 million acres of a planned 2.6 million acre seismic shoot. Early processing indicates a considerable uplift in imaging capability and reservoir characterization. Moving to the North Sea, production averaged approximately 54,000 BOE per day during the quarter and was temporarily constrained by maintenance on compressors in the Beryl area. Quarter-to-quarter production was flat as we brought online only one well. During the third quarter, North Sea operations will be impacted by annual turnaround maintenance which will reduce our production approximately 3,000 BOEs per day. This is planned activity which occurs every year at this time. Production is expected to bounce back and accelerate in the fourth quarter with the benefit of new wells scheduled to come online. We anticipate achieving our highest average production rate for the year in the North Sea during the fourth quarter. We just TD'd our fourth development well in the Callater field at Beryl's. This well logged over 580 feet of Cormorant pay with virgin pressure. We anticipate an online date in early Q4. This well should have a positive impact both on production and reserves. Apache owns 55% working interest. To sum up operationally, we remain on track for a good year and are focused on building on the success in quarters ahead. I will now turn the call over to Steve.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Tim. As noted in the press release issued last night, under generally accepted accounting principles, Apache reported second quarter of 2018 net income of $195 million or $0.51 per diluted common share. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $192 million, or $0.50 per share. Second quarter financial performance was good across the board. Production volumes were strong as John outlined previously. Average realized oil price was over $69 per barrel as nearly 70% of our global oil production received Brent or Gulf Coast linked pricing. Costs remained under control as LOE, G&A, DD&A and cash taxes were all consistent with or better than latest guidance. Capital investments in the quarter were $833 million, bringing the first half total to $1.69 billion. As John noted, we plan to invest at a similar pace in the second half of the year, which will bring our total planned capital in 2018 to approximately $3.4 billion. This represents about $400 million of increased investment relative to prior guidance, which can be characterized as follows. The majority of the increase, roughly two thirds, is attributable to incremental drilling, completions and facilities investment in the Permian Basin including Alpine High. This reflects the two Midland Basin rigs we are adding in third quarter, the costs for longer laterals and larger stimulations in Alpine High and a slightly higher well count throughout the Permian due to the efficiencies in our drilling program. Approximately $145 million of the incremental investment will be at Alpine High and $120 million will be elsewhere in the Permian. For all of the reasons John outlined previously, these increases will maximize capital deployment efficiencies and will help drive incremental production in late 2018 but more materially into 2019 and beyond. Approximately $75 million of the additional capital is attributable to general service cost inflation in excess of what we budgeted for the year. The remainder is associated with a number of smaller items. This includes incremental investment at Garten due to a 100% retained working interest and upsizing the topside facility to handle larger production volumes. It also comprises long lead items for our anticipated Suriname exploration program and various other investments mostly associated with our unconventional exploration portfolio. With the combination of higher production volumes and improved oil prices, cash flows have been very strong. Our cash return on invested capital for the first half of 2018 was 20% on an annualized basis and we ended the second quarter with nearly $1 billion of cash on hand. We anticipate the recent price environment and our outperformance on production volumes will continue. Both will contribute to a strong cash flow performance for the year with full year free cash flow being better than originally planned even with the increase in capital investment. We will also likely see some small non-strategic asset divestments in the second half of 2018, which will further strengthen year-end liquidity. To summarize and expand on our production guidance, estimates for our third quarter volumes are as follows: total Apache adjusted production of 398,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 8,000 from second quarter; international adjusted production of 128,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 6,000 from second quarter, primarily due to routine maintenance activity in the North Sea; U.S. production of 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 15,000 from second quarter; Permian Basin production of 220,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 18,000 from second quarter; and Alpine High production of 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 18,000 or more than 50% growth from second quarter. We have also updated all of our full year production guidance. John referenced much of this in his remarks, so I will not repeat them. One thing I would note, clearly our U.S. production guidance reflects strong trends in performance. It could easily go unnoticed, but our international production has also done very well. Our updated guidance for international production is at the midpoint of our original guidance for the year. This includes a negative impact that the strong Brent pricing has had on our Egypt volumes. Without that price impact, our international volumes would have been near the top end of our original guidance range. Please refer to our quarterly supplement for information on all guidance updates. I will conclude with some views on how we are dealing with Permian takeaway and realization issues. We are clearly in a period of tightening takeaway capacity and therefore widening differentials. Ultimately, more takeaway capacity is the only solution. The entire industry is working on that situation and Apache is certainly playing our part. We recently announced material participation in projects involving oil, gas and NGLs. Good progress is being made and relief will start showing up next year. For the time being, we focus on the current situation day by day in a very pragmatic way. We take steps to make sure our product flows to market and gets the best possible realized price. We have included in our quarterly supplement a summary of our Permian oil and gas marketing positions for 2018 and now for 2019 as well. Let me touch on just a few things quickly. On the oil side, we had some success in second quarter by moving 12% of our Permian oil volumes from evergreen contracts subject to cancellation to term contracts. We now have 50% of our Permian oil for both 2018 and 2019 on term sales contracts that are backed by firm transport arrangements. As we outlined previously, approximately 30% of our production is West Texas sour. We continue to see very little flow risk with these volumes as they are sold to regional refineries specifically equipped to run sour crude. We manage the remaining 20% of oil production very closely and do not currently believe it will result in any production shut-ins. With respect to differentials, we added some Midland oil basis hedges in second quarter. We are currently exposed to Midland oil basis movements for just under 60% of our 2018 Permian oil volumes. In 2019, absent any further hedging, that will increase by about 10%. With respect to Permian gas, our risks related to takeaway and basis differentials did not materially change in the second quarter. Nearly 90% of 2018 volumes and over 80% of 2019 volumes are on term contracts or have access to firm transport to other markets. 65% of our 2018 Permian gas volumes are subject to movements in Waha or our El Paso Permian differentials. In 2019 this falls to just under 60% as new transport capacity becomes accessible. In summary, we see the current situation as transitory and are participating in some of the key solutions. We have heard the discussions and in some cases seen decisions to reduce Permian rig count. We see this as a logical choice for those at risk of materially curtailed production. We do not anticipate that situation for Apache. To the contrary, we believe the long-term value created by advancing progress at Alpine High and other Apache assets in the Permian Basin more than offsets the potential impact of short-lived weaker basis differentials. Consequently, absent a significant change in the basis differential outlook, we will not materially revise our planned capital investment and we will most likely stay the course. Now I'll turn the call back over to John.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Steve. I would like to sum up by emphasizing that 2018 has been an exceptional year thus far in terms of strategic progress and operational execution. The capital efficiency of our drilling and completion programs is improving throughout the Permian Basin. We are running at an optimized activity level and pace demonstrating good cost discipline and generating high rates of return. At Alpine High, now we have our primary infrastructure in place and are in the early stages of a significant long-term value accretive production ramp. We are seeing some excellent well results and our cryogenic processing is on track for a mid 2019 start-up, which will drive a significant increase in liquids production, cash margins and returns. In the Midland and Delaware Basins, our wells are outperforming and unconventional oil production is the primary driver of our U.S. production guidance increase this year. Notably, in less than one year, we have completely replaced the 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of the vested Canadian production with Permian volumes. This strategic portfolio rotation is positively impacting our margins and is a great example of Apache's returns-focused portfolio approach. We continue to generate substantial free cash flow in Egypt and the North Sea as these regions benefit from premium Brent crude prices as well as higher realized NGL and natural gas prices than the U.S. And lastly, I know that many of you are curious about the status of our midstream business. We have been engaged in a very thoughtful and deliberate process with regard to creating and realizing value for our Alpine High midstream assets. As you have seen in our recent announcements, we have secured equity options in five transportation projects that will move oil, gas and NGL to the Gulf Coast from the Permian Basin. These options are very strategic for Alpine High, Apache and the Delaware Basin in general. We have worked the timing of these options to coincide with consummation of a larger midstream transaction to leverage their fully integrated value potential. We are in the advanced stages of a transaction that we anticipate will close before year-end and we'll come back to you with more details on this as soon as practical. And with that, we will turn the call over to Q&A.
Operator: Your first question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.
Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Question on the Alpine High. In the past, in recent past, you've guided toward the typical Alpine High well at say, 9 to 15 Bcfe, that upper range, 16 to 21 Bcfe. But those were at 4,400 foot laterals. So my question is two part, one, how should we think about these more recent 8,000 foot laterals in terms of EURs? And two, can you guide us directionally toward the typical well versus the upper range well? Where are the arrow bars on what those EURs could ultimately be?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Bob, good morning. It's a great question. I will tell you that we are early in changing the completions, as we've alluded to. That's one of the reasons on the capital side. We now have enough data going back to last year that confirms some of the strategic testing on the larger fracs is making a bigger impact as well. And so we're kind of shifting gears and we're early in those and for now I want to leave those because our location counts all kind of tie back to that. But we will be coming back with, as we get some more of these wells on and we do some more testing, you're going to see numbers go up as the productivity improves. So we'll come back to you with those and update, in general, the whole impact of that.
Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: But should I think of things in terms of EUR per foot or should I just wait?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: EUR per foot, I can tell you, we're seeing is translating pretty equivalently. So the longer laterals are going up on the lateral side, but I think with the opportunity to see even more changes is going to be on the completion designs which we're about to start doing on some of these pads. So for now, lateral foots, you can probably translate to what we've shown. But we'll come back to you when we've got more data to prove it.
Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Quick follow up. What are you doing exactly to save $400,000 on the completion side? Is it efficiencies or technology or some combination?
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Bob, a lot of it is just operational efficiencies. On the completions side, we've really been able to reduce our pump time substantially. We're drilling out our plugs even quicker and we've even made progress just on frac crew moves. And this is related to, it's given us a 20% reduction in our cycle time, which is on a mile and half lateral is about $400,000 savings. So it's primarily just completion efficiencies.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: And, Bob, I'll add to what Tim just said. If you go back, I mean we realized in early May we were running into it was going to create some challenges. And the good news is, we set a frac crew down in the Midland basis for two months, both June and July, and still been able to come in ahead of guidance on the numbers. So I really have got to give a lot of credit to the operational folks and the teams for the progress that we're making. And we said this would happen. I mean this goes back to the strategic testing we did last fall when we started doing pads on half section tests in the Midland Basin, you're seeing those results and now you're seeing us also doing similar things at Alpine High. So really, really credit to the field folks and the engineers and technical support.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.
John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi, guys.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Good morning, John.
John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So the first question related to Alpine High midstream, and I'm just wondering if you can kind of talk about how you sort of think about the trade-off with any potential deal where you're trying to remove future CapEx while also trying to retain as much equity as possible given the knowledge that, as Alpine High volumes ramp pretty dramatically in the next few years, the value of the Alpine High midstream goes up considerably as well.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean in a lot of ways you just kind of answered your question. But I'll say a few words here, a little more than in the prepared remarks. We're deep in the process and we are very confident that we will get something done by year-end. Clearly the number one objective has been to remove capital from where it's competing directly with our upstream capital, which and moving it into a separate funding vehicle, which we will do. The second thing, as you pointed out, we want to maintain as much of this enterprise as possible purely because number one, I think everybody's going to figure out that it's much more valuable to Alpine High, to Apache, and even the whole Delaware Basin than people realize. And secondly, we see that value as growing and accreting significantly over the next several years. So we'd like to hang on to as much of it is possible from that standpoint. On the timing, we've had to kind of coincide this with some of the equity options that we've been announcing and as we alluded to in the comments, there's now five of them, so we've kind of had to run those in parallel paths. But we're now deep into the throes and clearly we want to be able to hang on to as much of it as possible.
John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, John, and then my follow-up, just on looking at the revised CapEx budget, the changes on the U.S. side makes perfect sense. When I'm looking at the international CapEx number, which actually didn't change despite the increased kind of fast tracking on Garten, and then what's happening with Suriname, is there some other areas internationally that either are getting less capital than previous or you're just doing better on some costs? Or just, what allowed international to stay flat despite what's happening with Garten and Suriname?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: I think that's just kind of in the round off. I mean the big thing is capital is actually going up in the North Sea with Garten as we now have 100% of it. But the other thing is, some of it's timing of the Ocean Patriot and we've reset that rig contract now to a significantly lower number than we've been burdened with the last three years. So it's kind of getting caught in the round off there, but it actually has gone up as we accelerate Garten on the capital side.
John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks, John. Nice quarter.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good morning, John, to you and your team there.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Good morning, Charles.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: I wanted ask a question about the Blackfoot pad and what you guys are seeing on the early flow-back there. I know you talked a little bit about in your prepared marks and you put some stuff in your slide presentation. But I wonder if you could share any more color on where you are on the flow back of that pad, if you're almost done cleaning up or you're still in the early stages of cleaning up on some of those wells. And what, if anything, you're seeing between, what kind of variation you may be seeing between the upper Woodford landing zones and the lower Woodford landing zones?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, Charles, I'll say it's dynamic. I mean, first thing is as you know, this is 12 wells in the Woodford in a half section. So this would translate into a full section of 24 Woodford wells only, which is a lot. They're on 660 foot spacing. We are not seeing any interference. I will tell you, it's is very, very dynamic and we're very early. In fact, we went to print yesterday with our numbers and this morning, the Blackfoot now is at 102 million a day from the 93 that we had in there. So that shows you kind of the trajectory that it's on. We still do not have everything unloaded. So it's climbing very well. It's performing very strongly, so we're very, very excited about what we're seeing. And changing quickly, so tomorrow I'd have a different answer for you.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you, John. And then on the other side of the Permian, I wondered if you, Tim went through a lot of detail on how you've changed your, not just your designs but also your operational pace on that side. And I wondered if you could talk about the Lynch pad, which is that 8 well pad in the Wildfire area that you guys brought online. It had some good rates, but is that benefiting from these new designs, the new approach? Or maybe just add a little color to what was happening there.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Yeah, on the Lynch pad, it's an 8 well pad that's in the Wolfcamp B. And this was really a spacing test. We did some 10-bys and 8-bys in this pad, 7,300 foot lateral length. And you can see the rates are good, 1,275 barrels of oil equivalent per day and mostly oil from the IP. And we continue to do spacing tests. We've got another 10 wells that are online and some of them are Wildfire as well, very early stages of flow back, but they are on 6-by spacing. So we'll share results with you about that next quarter. But these are spacing test wells in the Wolfcamp B and we're going to compare them to 6-by next quarter.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: And so, I'm sorry, just real quick clarification, Tim. The 10-by spacing, so that's spacing equivalent to 10 wells across a section?
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: That's correct. Part of the pad is 10 wells per section spacing and part of it's 8-by.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, Tim.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: You bet.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.
Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey. Can you talk about how you're looking to go about Alpine High right now? It sounds like you're starting to move into some optimization based on what you've seen. But I know early on you were trying to do things like separate various factors, right, lateral length, frac that you're putting on this to get a good sense of really what's driving performance. Where are we with that? And how does that sort of drive you for these 60, 70 completions you've got at the end of this year and maybe into 2019?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean, it's exciting because now we've got data and we've been deliberate on those tests. And as you've correctly noted, we weren't moving many dials, except one usually for a reason, so we have a good baseline. It's clear to us now that we're going to be increasing the frac size. It's clear to us that we can go tighter with the current frac designs. And now, we're moving into the pattern and spacing tests, where we're testing things between zones, between formations, both aerially, spatially and so forth. And so, now you'll see us start to move some of those dials as we crank up the completions. So we'll continue the very deliberate process. It just takes time to do it right. If you jump out there and go drill too many wells and pump too big of fracs and you get a lot of interference, then you got to go back and try to figure out how you unwind that. And so, what we've been is very deliberate with it and we're moving into that next phase. And we've got a plan. We've stuck to it and you're starting to see the benefit come and we're really excited about the results and the learnings that we continue to incorporate.
Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC: All right. Great. Appreciate that. And a follow-up on the Egypt, with some of this enhanced seismic imagery you've gotten back, it sounds like you got some of it back, how much now maybe you had it in your hands to take a look at it? And what are you seeing now versus maybe what you had thought of it going into it?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I haven't seen the new data. I've seen snippets of the new data. We've actually compared it to some of the 2013 vintage stuff. I'm looking at one of my ops guys over here, but I will tell you, I've heard now we're seeing some fault lines in some of our existing fields, which probably sets up more drilling, so you could see some things at Ptah, Berenice. I'll be over there in the fairly near future. We'll get to review some things, but we're excited about it. It's what we thought it would be. It helps us see image better, the subsurface, which is going to lead to more wells, stronger results and a better understanding. And plus, we're going to have a better handle on some of the recoveries and things. So, it's a whole new lens and it's going to be very helpful.
Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks for that.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. My first one is on what I guess a midstream monetization could mean for the budget this year. Are you able to eliminate some of the planned incremental spend with a deal and for parts of the budget that have been spent ahead of an announcement or a closing? Is there an opportunity for rebates or reimbursements for at least the Alpine High piece?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Jeoff, obviously, we could make it look however we want to look. I mean, we could take a lot of cash out. We could eliminate capital and we could make the effective date whenever, whatever we want that date to be. So we've made pretty clear in here that our CapEx guide for the year-end still includes 100% of the midstream spend. We've made it clear that getting something done could pull some of that back and there's opportunity there. So I'll just say wait with us. It's going to have an impact but wait with us until we're in a position to disclose more because we're deep in the process, so.
Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Got it. And then just digging into the incremental Alpine High piece by itself, should we think of that as all or just maybe primarily longer laterals and completion enhancements? Or is there a portion related to midstream spend that was accelerated into this year from next year's plan initially?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: It was a little bit of the midstream that we were looking at trying to accelerate cryo, but as we've said, most of the two thirds of the CapEx increase is going into drilling completions and it's new activity. When we made very clear that two thirds of it's new activity that will be incremental. Most of it is this back half of the year, which is why it'll impact 2019 and 2020. There's a little bit of impact on 2018, but not much. There has been a little bit of inflation, about I'd say just under 20% is, and we budgeted a 10% to 15% rise, but anything that has to do with trucking, people, steel, or chemicals, there are some headwinds out there. And so there's a portion of it that's tied to that. And then we mentioned some on the exploration side, so. But most of it's new activity and two-thirds of it in Permian and it's new activity.
Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of John Herrlin with Société Générale.
John P. Herrlin - Société Générale: Thanks. You're gathering a lot of water at Alpine High. Are you going to be able to recycle any of it?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: John, everything we're gathering, we're recycling. And the beauty of our transgressive source center rolls, it doesn't produce very much. So it's really the frac water that we're gathering. We produce it back, is load, and then we recycle it and reuse it. So I'll let Tim jump in on some more details.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Yeah, we've currently got five water recycling facilities out there and we are currently recycling about 90% of our produced water right now. That really is only about half of our frac water needs currently. So we do have to have makeup water and we do use brackish source for that. But by year-end, we feel like we'll be able to utilize about 80% of recycled water for our fracs.
John P. Herrlin - Société Générale: Okay. Great. Next one for me is on Dixieland. You had slightly stronger well results in the first quarter at Burnside and one other, and I was wondering how much heterogeneity do you have? Like Burnside and Bull Run were a little bit stronger than some of the other wells. So I'm not worried about everything always staying at the same level, but I was wondering how much heterogeneity do you see since you're basically doing similar type completions?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: So, John, as you know, that's why we talk about Bone Springs and Wolfcamp as being pair sequences. Geologically, you have heterogeneity. Tim, do you want to add anything specifically to that area?
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Yeah, I mean, we only have seven sections there. It's not like it's a big area, so it's fairly consistent. We've got two proven landing zones. We will be testing two additional landing zones out there. We brought 20 wells online here in the first half, 11 in the second quarter, and they're about 1,500 BOE per day. And these are just mile laterals, actually 4,400 foot laterals. So it's been a very, very economically attractive program for us. So we think we've still got a pretty bright future for the next couple years.
John P. Herrlin - Société Générale: Okay. Great. Thank you.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Thanks, John.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: In Alpine High, how do the results of some of the efficiencies, lateral length and spacing tests in areas like Dogwood change the relative rates of return and prioritization of the wet gas versus dry gas drilling? And how, if at all, does that influence your focus areas over the next few quarters?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean if you look at the wet gas, dry gas, the breakevens on the wet gas are still going to be much better just because of the amount of the liquids. So it won't really change the pecking order there, but what it really changes is is number of wells we need to drill and some of those things in terms of the plan. So it can change the cadence and the sequence as you look at the capital that's going to the, what we'll call, retention wells versus the impact wells.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. And then you've highlighted across the portfolio, but particularly in the Alpine High various efficiencies. And I wonder if you could talk about where you see these efficiencies going from here, whether we've just had a surge or whether you think this pace is going to continue. And how do you draw the line on when you let those efficiencies play through to higher CapEx versus just choose to become more narrowly focused within the portfolio?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean I think if you look at our Permian, Brian, we've been running 17 rigs since the second quarter of last year. And so we're at what we think's a pretty darn good baseload. Clearly the frac efficiencies took a step function forward and we've seen that. Now we're seeing the drilling time and the footage take a step function move forward, so this is a continual ebb and flow as you continue to get better reduced cycle times and so forth. But if you step back and look at our program and then you look at the results over the last year, Permian's up 39% year-over-year and oil's up 25% year-over-year and we've been pretty steady on the program. So what's changing at Alpine High is the completion design and more on the spacing tests, but when you look at the size program we're running, you look at the size cash engine that we're building to fund it, those are the things you have to factor in and you have to continue to integrate your learnings and be continuous improvement. And we stress to our folks to continue to get better in everything we do. And so you're going to have times where we're going to have to make adjustments as we continue to incorporate learnings. But it was a pretty easy call here as we look at what the engine for this thing looks like going into 2019.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Is it fair to say that if there is a free cash buffer to offset efficiency driven or even inflation driven increases in CapEx with no further change in activity, that that would be sufficient for you to further increase your budget?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean I don't think you can assume everything on the free cash side goes to budget, right? I mean what we're trying to do with our efficiency programs and what you've seen with the size is ultimately it's returns and value driven. And so that's the big factor. I mean, you look at our activity, it's really hasn't changed and it's not going to change much going into the fall. We've got to sprinkle a few rigs in to kind of keep it there with the frac crews and so forth. But we're getting to a point in the, we get the midstream deal done in the very near future with the engine that we've built that we actually see free cash flow. And it puts us in a position where we can start to truly, for the first time since coming out of this downturn, we can look now at other things to do. And those are things that we're very excited about because we can see a pathway to it, pretty near future.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Leo Mariani with National Alliance Securities.
Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities: Hey, guys. I was hoping that you could delve a little bit more into some of the exploration efforts that you guys alluded to on the call. You guys did mention kind of an unconventional U.S. exploration program. Just trying to get a sense of maybe what the dollars are that are exposed to that in next year's budget. And also was hoping for a little bit more detail on Suriname in terms of when you guys might spud a well there. What's your working interest there, as in what do you see as the potential in Suriname?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, a couple things, Leo, and thanks for the question. I mean, number one, I'll address them kind of in the order. On the unconventional side in the U.S., there's not a lot of dollars. What we're looking for there is large impact, large scale opportunities that are in various stages that we could acquire at low cost. And much like when we put something like Alpine High together, we put together 350,000 acres out there for less than $1,300 an acre. So it would be those types of things, but there's not a lot of capital at this stage but if you're looking in the right places, it doesn't take a lot of capital to go a long way. So not a position to say a lot more than that, but we do have some things we're working on on the unconventional side. As it relates to Suriname, clearly what we've said, we've got 2 blocks in the offshore there, Block 58, we own 100%. It's about 1.4 million acres. We have 45% of Block 53. We will definitely commence a program in 2019 and we've started to purchase the long lead items. We got the 3D back and we're very, very excited about the potential. We're on trend with the success that's happened across the water boundary in Guyana and it's exploration that could be very, very impactful for Apache and currently today we own 100% of it.
Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities: All right, guys, thanks.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Your final question is from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, John, good morning. I got a couple to close us out here, it looks like. My first one is on Egypt. As we understand it, in the last six or nine months, the government's gone through quite a lot of change in deregulating its gas market. It's removed subsidies from local industrial prices. You know everything that's going on there, and it's incentivizing exploration. I'm curious if any of that is filtering through to what you're doing, especially in your new concession, how you see the prognosis for seeing us maybe starting to see an uplift in your exploration activity translating to higher price realizations? And then I've got a quick follow up, please.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean I think the key for us, Doug, is number one, all the activity, all the gas coming on has been very beneficial for Egypt, which is a good thing, and that translates into the country's just financial wherewithal. So things are going extremely well. I think the key for us is, is we've been able to pick up new concessions for the first time since 2006. We're shooting a large 3D. We're in between areas where we know there are big structures and really, really fertile ground. So we're very excited about that. We're excited about the opportunity to continue to grow the free cash flow and we think we can be in a position to also grow our volumes in Egypt, and especially on the oil side. So I think in general, it's a very promising environment for Apache and things are going extremely well and we're very excited about the future.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just to be clear, has the new exploration acreage come with come with different terms as it relates to realized gas pricing?
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: All the concessions are, you bid those. The thing I will say is, is we've kind of stuck to our guns historically, which is why you went through a drought where others came in and picked up other concessions. We've stuck to our guns in terms of how we've approached it. So we feel good about that. We feel good about the new concessions, and we like the terms.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Understood. My follow up, if I may, is just jumping back to Alpine High very quickly that it's kind of a follow-up to Bob's question earlier about the 4,500 foot laterals and getting bigger and so on. Clearly it seems that there is upside risk to the guidance you gave us a couple years ago. How would you think about what that, how that translates to your production profile through 2020? Do you have lower decline rates by choking back the wells, for example? Do you have faster acceleration? Just if you could characterize how all of that plays into the infrastructure plan and so on, and I'll leave it there. Thanks.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Well, we have just a tremendous resource. And as we've said on today's call, we would tend to the high side of the previous guidance that we gave earlier this year. And clearly, productivity is improving. Wells are performing extremely well. We're shifting to pads. So I would just steer to the high side numbers as it relates to 2019 is what we've said now and we'll come back with some updated numbers as the year moves along.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great stuff. Thanks, fellows. Appreciate you taking my questions.
John J. Christmann IV - Apache Corp.: Thank you all. I just want to wrap up and like to leave you with three key takeaways from today's call. First Apache had another great quarter. We exceeded guidance and raised our 2018 outlook. Second, looking ahead to 2019 and 2020, there is a significant upside bias to our production outlook due to the added capital, which will benefit primarily 2019 and 2020, the capital efficiency improvements and strong well performance all in our Permian Basin. Additionally, total capital spending is likely to come down in 2018 to 2020 with the completion of our midstream transaction. And lastly, at Alpine High, we are seeing very good results from our strategic tests and production growth has entered the acceleration phase. I look forward to sharing our ongoing progress with you in the future.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the first quarter 2018 earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. And I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Good morning and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's First Quarter 2018 Financial and Operational Results Conference Call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; Executive Vice President of Operations Support, Tim Sullivan; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Steve Riney. Also available for the Q&A session are Mark Meyer, Senior Vice President, Energy Technology Strategies; and Dave Pursell, Senior Vice President, Planning and Energy Fundamentals. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 25 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our first quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. Please note the supplement was updated this morning to include information on our Permian Basin oil and gas marketing positions, which can be found on pages 22 and 23. On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt's tax barrels. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause the actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to John.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before I get to the results, I want to take a moment to recognize a long-time Apache who has recently announced his plans to retire later this year, Kregg Olson, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering. During his 26 years with Apache, Kregg's leadership and expertise have been significant contributors to our long term success. On behalf of all of Apache, I want to thank Kregg for his years of service and wish him well in retirement. In light of this change, we have announced Dave Pursell, Senior Vice President, Planning and Energy Fundamentals, will lead our Corporate Reservoir Engineering function upon Kregg's retirement. This transition is already underway, and we look forward to introducing you all to Dave in the months ahead. On today's call, I will review Apache's first quarter progress and provide highlights from some of our key operating areas. Tim Sullivan and Steve Riney will then provide a brief review of our operational and financial performance during the quarter. And before moving to Q&A, I will conclude with our perspective on a few themes we have been hearing recently from the investment community. Apache is off to a strong start this year. In the U.S., we exceeded our first quarter production guidance through solid operational execution, shorter completion cycle times, improving efficiencies, and continued outperformance from new wells placed online over the last two quarters. The positive impact of these items more than offset volume losses we incurred from unplanned facilities downtime and adverse weather. As noted in yesterday's press release, we delivered record production in the Permian Basin. And the excellent progress we made during the first quarter has prompted us to raise our U.S. production guidance for both the second quarter and full-year 2018. Internationally, our leverage to Brent oil pricing contributed to improving margins, higher cash returns, and strong free cash flow. Production was in line with guidance, which remains unchanged for the full year. Moving now to specific region performance, beginning with the Permian Basin. Our results continue to improve, as we strive for best in class execution, leveraging the best technology advancements and insightful data analytics. In the Midland Basin, our current drilling program is focused on section and half-section testing and development in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations. We are delineating additional landing zones within our core fields and assessing other parts of our acreage, where we are seeing positive early results. In the Delaware Basin, outside of Alpine High, we are generating solid growth from our Wolfcamp and Bone Spring drilling program. We are drilling multi-well development pads, testing incremental landing zones, and evaluating additional prospect areas. Our plan is to sustain a three rig drilling program outside of Alpine High in the Delaware Basin. We have made excellent progress reducing well costs, increasing productivity, and driving higher returns in the Midland and Delaware Basins. We are deliberately operating at a measured pace, which is enabling timely integration of key learnings into our capital program. On many occasions, we have stated that production growth will be the outcome of our disciplined returns focused investment program. We are certainly seeing that in the Midland and Delaware Basins, where daily oil production has increased 37% since the second quarter last year and in the Permian Basin as a whole, where daily oil production has increased 19% over the same time period. Turning now to Alpine High, where progress toward a value optimized full field development plan is continuing as planned. As I indicated on last quarter's call, you can monitor Alpine High progress on three key fronts, well cost reductions, well productivity, and inventory expansion. First, we are making substantial improvements on well costs. Our objective is to decrease average well costs by 25% from 2017. During the first quarter alone, we delivered an average 20% reduction. Having already achieved 80% of the target, we have clear visibility into further well cost reductions through the remainder of the year. Second, we are focused on enhancing well productivity at the section level, which is the true economic unit we are seeking to optimize. We are now gathering data from two important half-section multi-well pad tests, which Tim will provide details on in his remarks. And third, in terms of drilling inventory, recall that we increased our risked location count to more than 5,000 locations at our October webcast update. At the time, we characterized this as a conservative view based on only six landing zones and relatively wide spacing assumptions. We have now confirmed hydrocarbon production from 11 distinct landing zones. And we are continuing to delineate these and other landing zones across Alpine High. We are also testing tighter well spacing and have seen some encouraging initial results. While we are not updating our location count today, we are confident that as field delineation and development progresses, the risked location count will increase substantially over the next several years. Alpine High is also making great progress on lease operating expenses. LOE was approximately $4.50 per BOE in the first quarter, and we are targeting a decrease to less than $3 per BOE by year end. As previously indicated, we are on target to drive LOE per BOE below $2 by the end of 2020. One of the primary factors behind our low cost structure is that the transgressive source interval in the Woodford, Barnett and Penn [Pennsylvanian] produces very little water, resulting in minimal handling and disposal costs. On the midstream side, our buildout at Alpine High continues, with additional infrastructure coming online as expected. Our strategic objectives this year include finalizing a JV, or partial monetization of the midstream enterprise, and reaching agreements for future oil, gas, and NGL take away capacity. Moving on to Egypt, we are continuing with a high destiny seismic acquisition and processing program across our expansive acreage position, which will greatly enhance our subsurface imaging capabilities. We believe this will uncover numerous meaningful opportunities to grow future oil production on both new and legacy acreage. In the second half of this year, we plan to commence drilling on our new concessions, which comprise 1.6 million acres. We are very excited about these concessions, which are geologically similar to our producing acreage in the Western Desert and are virtually unexplored. In the North Sea, we recently announced an impactful discovery at Garten in the Beryl area. We believe this discovery will yield a minimum of 10 million barrels of oil with potential to move significantly higher. Apache owns 100% of Garten, which will be a relatively quick and inexpensive tieback to existing facilities. This should have a positive impact on our 2019 and 2020 international production guidance, which we will revisit later in the year. In summary, we are off to a great start in 2018. Execution is very strong, and we are investing capital efficiently and strengthening Apache's overall capabilities to deliver more sustainable, higher returns over the long term. Now, I will turn the call over to Tim Sullivan, who will provide some operational details on the quarter.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Good morning. My remarks will briefly cover first quarter 2018 production performance and capital efficiency, including drilling highlights and activity in our core regions. Operationally, we had a very good quarter and saw improvement in many key areas. We achieved first quarter company-wide adjusted production of approximately 367,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 6% increase from the same period a year ago and up slightly from the fourth quarter 2017. The Permian Basin remains the primary driver of our growth, where oil production increased 14% and total production increased 24% from the first quarter a year ago. This reflects the ongoing development of oil production in the Midland and Delaware Basins and the start-up of Alpine High. We averaged 16 rigs and four frac crews in the Permian Basin during the quarter, with seven rigs and one frac crew dedicated to Alpine High. In the Midland Basin, we have implemented a new completion design with more optimal stage and cluster spacing, which is contributing to improved early time well performance. We are fracture stimulating more lateral feet per day, completing wells faster and more efficiently, and realizing significant cost savings. For the quarter, we brought online 12 wells in the Wolfcamp formation with an average peak 30-day IP exceeding 1,100 BOE per day, consisting of 75% oil. Notably, we tested our first Wolfcamp C producer, which achieved a very encouraging 30-day IP of nearly 1,150 BOE per day, 70% oil. These positive results could open up hundreds of additional Wolfcamp C locations across our acreage position. Moving to the Delaware Basin, production at Alpine High averaged 26,300 BOE per day. Of note, we brought online our first multi-well pad in the wet gas window, the four-well Chinook pad, which delivered peak 30-day IPs averaging 5.2 million cubic feet of gas and 170 barrels of oil per day. The Chinook gas has an average BTU content of 1,350 and is currently recovering 50 barrels of NGLs per 1 million cubic feet of gas. This yield is expected to increase to 150 [barrels] with the addition of cryo. We are pleased with these early results, which will yield attractive economics, as well cost averaged only $6.4 million. A year ago, drilled on a one-off basis, these wells would have cost more than $8 million per well. We have made significant progress on our cost reduction goal at Alpine High, targeting an average completed well cost of $6.2 million for 2018. As we move to pad operations, we are realizing the benefit of increasing efficiencies and reducing well costs. On the drilling side, these include the use of less expensive spudder rigs to drill surface and intermediate holes; standardized casing programs, and, in many wells, the elimination of a casing string; and optimized bits and bottom-hole assemblies for specific areas. Completion savings include the ability to pump more frac stages per day, optimize sand loading to pattern size, and the use of recycled and brackish water. At the end of 2017, we placed on production the Dogwood pad, our first multi-well development pad in Alpine High's dry gas window. This pad has been producing for 119 days with cumulative production of 6.4 BCF. The stabilized production rate from the six-well pad is currently 62 million cubic feet per day, compared to the initial peak 30-day IP of more than 70 million cubic feet per day. Importantly, we have seen no interference between these wells at 660 [foot] spacing, which is a very encouraging indicator for tighter well spacing during full-field development. Keep in mind that our current 5,000 well location count assumes 925-foot spacing in the dry gas window and 800-foot spacing in the wet gas window. Other downspacing tests are in progress. Elsewhere in the U.S., production for the Mid-Continent region increased from the preceding quarter as a result of the recent completion of approximately eight net wells over the last two quarters in the SCOOP. These are showing strong performance. And this production uplift will allow us to hold Mid-Continent production flat or grow slightly year over year. Internationally, Apache remains the largest oil producer and most active driller in Egypt. For the quarter, Egypt adjusted production averaged approximately 80,000 BOE per day, down slightly from the fourth quarter 2017. We drilled and completed 28 operated wells with an 86% success rate. Of particular note, the Apries East-1X, a discovery in the Shushan Basin, found 280 feet of pay in the Shifa formation. The gas condensate reservoir flow tested 20 million cubic feet of gas per day and 2,400 barrels of condensate. This success sets up several development and follow-on exploration wells in the area. Our seismic acquisition is ahead of schedule. To date, we have acquired 710,000 acres of a planned 2.6 million acre seismic shoot, spanning four different basins in the Western Desert. Early results indicate the data will deliver a paradigm shift in imaging capability and reservoir characterization. Moving to the North Sea, production averaged 54,000 BOE per day during the quarter and was impacted by a number of items, including downtime associated with inclement weather, unscheduled maintenance and repair on compressors in the Beryl area, and periodic interruptions on the Forties Pipeline System. No new wells were placed on production during the quarter, which contributed to a sequential decline from the fourth quarter. As we have stated before, production in the North Sea tends to be lumpy on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but we are seeing some of the above conditions abate thus far in the second quarter. As John noted, an important highlight for the quarter was our discovery at Garten, which is located only 6 kilometers from the Beryl Alpha facilities. The discovery well encountered more than 700-foot of net pay from multiple zones. Drilling, completion, and tieback costs are estimated at approximately $60 million. And with minimum reserve estimate of 10 million barrels of oil, we expect very low F&D costs. To sum up, operationally, we are off to a very good start to the year and are focused on building this momentum in the quarters ahead. I will now turn the call over to Steve.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Tim. Let me start with first quarter results. As noted in our press release issued last night, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported first quarter 2018 net income of $145 million, or $0.38 per diluted common share. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $124 million, or $0.32 per share, the most significant adjustment being a $39 million after-tax unrealized gain on our derivative positions. As John outlined, our U.S. production exceeded guidance by 4%, while international production was in line with guidance. Capital investment of approximately $850 million was above guidance, due to accelerated activity in the Permian Basin, primarily driven by more efficient completion times. There was also additional spending on our Garten discovery in the North Sea, due to a higher working interest than previously planned. Despite inflationary pressures, costs remained under control during the quarter. Nearly all categories of costs ended the quarter consistent with or better than latest guidance. Two specific areas of costs included accounting impacts for one-off type changes. First, G&A for the quarter includes approximately $10 million of non-cash charges related to a change in retirement policy. Second quarter G&A will include a similar amount of non-cash charges. Second, gathering, transmission, and processing costs for the quarter, reflect the reclassification of certain charges under the new revenue recognition rules adopted for 2018. This change has no net effect on results. In the past, these costs were netted against revenue. Now, they are recognized as an expense, and thus our reported revenues have increased by the same amount. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 47% on a GAAP basis. This is higher than most would expect due to the accounting treatment of U.S. taxes. We operate at a profit in Egypt and the UK and accrue taxes at the average effective tax rates of 45% and 40%, respectively. In the U.S., we operated at a small loss, which would normally bring the average effective tax rate down. However, uncertainty in realizing these benefits precludes us from recognizing them on an ongoing basis today. The result is that the GAAP effective tax rate is a bit high, but there is no impact on cash flow. Moving now to guidance. Following strong first quarter results, we are increasing full-year U.S. production guidance to a range of 250,000 to 258,000 BOEs per day, up from 245,000 to 255,000. Most of this increase is attributable to the Permian Basin. Our 2018 international guidance remains unchanged at this time. On the full year guidance for other items, we are making only one change, increasing cash taxes to a range of $175 million to $225 million. This reflects the anticipated income uplift from improving realizations for North Sea crude oil production. For the second quarter, we anticipate U.S. production will be approximately 248,000 BOE per day. And adjusted international production is expected to average 135,000 BOEs per day. This would result in 7% quarter-on-quarter U.S. production growth and 4% overall growth worldwide. We have provided second quarter guidance for a number of other items, but I will not cover those in detail. You can find them in our financial and operational supplement. Turning now to Alpine High midstream, we are currently operating 121 miles of gathering line, 33 miles of 30-inch trunk line, 34 central tank batteries, and 780 million cubic feet per day of inlet gas processing capacity. An additional 50 million cubic feet per day processing capacity expansion was planned for later this year. We are now looking at options to eliminate this expansion by bringing forward the mid-2019 planned start-up of the first cryo facility. We are actively working design and procurement for three 200 million cubic feet per day cryo plants. Once fully operational, these facilities will significantly increase our NGL volumes out of Alpine High, boosting overall liquids production from the play. Plans to joint venture or partially monetize the Alpine High midstream are on track and a formal process is underway. That process has drawn a significant amount of interest from a broad range of potential partners. And we are confident we will put some form of venture in place during 2018. I'd like to close by commenting on the steps we have taken to mitigate the impact of widening Permian Basin differentials. We recognized the potential issue over a year ago and have been proactive in addressing it through various strategies. We have in place a combination of basis hedges, sales contracts, and firm transportation to access other pricing points. We anticipate a relatively tight market situation will last through much of 2019, and that is the timeframe we have targeted for mitigation efforts. While we have some exposure to both price risk and product flow risk, we are taking actions and looking for opportunities to further mitigate both of these risks. Now, I'll turn the call back to John for some final remarks before moving to Q&A.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Steve. Before we open the call to Q&A, I would like to comment on a couple of the recurring topics we have heard during recent interactions with shareholders and the broader investment community. With oil prices well above the baseline for 2018 planning, there is a lot of focus on what industry will be doing with the extra cash flows. For Apache, the answer to that question has to be based on the key elements of our plan for the year. Our 2018 base plan showed an approximate outspend of $700 million at $58 WTI, which was primarily driven by the Alpine High midstream investment program of $500 million. In conjunction with that plan, we outlined our desire to transact the midstream business in a way that would eliminate our ongoing funding obligation, while still leaving us significantly invested in the future value add from the growth that will come from the upstream. As Steve outlined, we are well into that process. And we are confident that we will execute such a transaction in 2018. That said, the timing and structure of this event are not finalized, and we will plan and respond accordingly. As such, our first priority for any extra cash flows in 2018 will be to close the cash flow gap with our overall capital program, including Alpine High midstream. When we have better visibility to full year cash flows and certainty around the midstream outcome, we will then consider other options, including the return of additional capital to shareholders and incremental capital investment. Another common topic is Permian Basin's supply growth, take away capacity, and the resulting impact on oil and gas basis differentials. Both oil and gas take away capacity is tightening as we move through the year and into late 2019. Basin offtake capacity is the main concern in this situation, and Apache is well protected through a combination of firm sales contracts and firm transportation solutions for the majority of our projected volumes. A related concern is the widening basis differentials that accompany a constrained market. Here again we have taken proactive steps through basis hedges and firm transportation commitments that will help mitigate the price risk. I won't go into the details here, but we have included a few slides in our first quarter supplement that describe our current Permian marketing position and hedges. Pipeline offtake constraints and differential widening will be a relatively short lived condition. The industry has been there before in the Permian, and these issues were quickly resolved, as Permian Basin intrastate pipeline capacity is comparatively easy to build. Over the longer term, the Permian Basin provides a tremendous opportunity for Apache to deliver attractive growth at high rates of return. We have the fourth-largest acreage footprint and plan to commit 70% of our capital to the basin over the next three years. That said, accelerating industry activity is creating significant competition for oilfield services and nontrivial operational challenges. In this environment, our priority is to protect and grow returns. We are operating at a disciplined pace with the objective to be the returns leader in the Permian with growth as an outcome. And with that, we are ready to move to Q&A.
Operator: And our first question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.
John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. When I'm looking at the impressive cost reductions at Alpine High, you've already achieved kind of 80% of the target that you had, and you're really just starting to get kind of the impacts or the benefits from the pad development. I guess what's kind of been the biggest surprise relative to your initial expectations?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: John, I think it's just a matter of moving into pads, I mean the drilling analytics, and the things we've been able to do. We've originally said we thought we could get down to $4 million to $6 million. So getting to the $6.2 million target this year, we knew we would be able to achieve it. And I think probably just being able to get there as quickly as we have, given the inflation we've had on some of the small services. So I'm really pleased with where we are. I can tell you we see pacesetters daily coming out of there with all the analytics and technical tools we're applying. And I expect us to continue to drive those costs down. So it's a great story and is going to only get better.
John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. And then when I look at Alpine High with basically you all averaging seven rigs and the one frac crew, once all the midstream is taken care of, can you kind of give me an idea kind of how that ratio of rigs to frac crews would you see changing kind of in 2019 and beyond?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean we're at a period right now where you're working both your frac crews and your rig counts, and they will be dynamic. We've actually got two crews in that region, one of them kind of bounces back and forth between there and the Delaware. So it's really not just directly, I would say, one. A lot of that's a function of the pad and the timing and how we're scheduling that. So over time, we would expect both. We've seen significant efficiencies on the completion side in the Midland. And I think you in general are going to see ratios similar to what we have, but probably in that same line.
John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. And just the last one for me, following on the really impressive discovery at Garten, you all said you're going to revisit the international guidance on 2019 and 2020. Just maybe sort of an idea of kind of when you think you'd have enough information to at least preliminarily give some idea on how that changes numbers?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Garten is a very exciting discovery for us. And it will be material to our North Sea. I mean part of this will hinge on getting the well on and testing it, as well as evaluating how many other wells there might be there. This structure could – is more subtle and could be significantly bigger than the 10 million barrels that we have disclosed. So as the year progresses and we get to do more technical work, we'll come back with that sometime later this year. But it's going to have an impact positively in 2019 and 2020.
John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I appreciate it. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein.
Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for the disclosure on the gas positioning in the Permian. Can you talk – and you guys have thought about this, clearly, what are tactically some of the things you would do if gas production flow risk emerged?
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah, hey, Bob. This is Steve. Well, the thing is we are continuing daily with the contracting strategy for gas out of the Permian Basin and Alpine High. You see in the supplement we have 91% of our gas production planned for 2018. That's either on firm transport or is into gas sales contracts that require taking that gas. So really only 9% of our production volume that we have planned for this year on the gas side in all of the Permian is at risk to any type of a takeaway capacity constraint. And we work on that daily. We're looking at more firm transport, more opportunity to get product out of Alpine High and get it into other basins. As you know, there's a lot of activity out there in the market on that. And we're very active in all of those types of conversations. And I would anticipate there will be more activity on that as we go through 2018 and into 2019. We're also looking at – we're also – there are option – we do have two large pipes going to Mexico that run to the north and to the south of Alpine High. And we are looking at options and possibilities on moving product on those as well.
Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And I heard your approach that by 2021, this is a – or 2020, 2021, this is something that the industry typically solves. How are you set up for 2019? Because you are growing gas fairly prolifically through 2019.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah, we're still working on that. We've got the Gulf Coast Express that'll be coming online in the third quarter of 2019. That'll take care of a lot of the growth after that point. And then we're continuing to work the contracting side of this. As long as we have firm contracts to move our product with customers and they have the transport capacity, then our product will move.
Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Morris with Citi.
Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you and congratulations, John, on some nice well results in the Permian and on the Wolfcamp C discovery.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you.
Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: You mentioned that – you're welcome. You mentioned that at Alpine High you've now delineated 11 distinct landing zones. And you've had nice results from the pilots targeting the Woodford and Barnett formations so far. Can you say what other formations you'll be targeting this year with your drilling activity?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Bob, as we've said, we'll have about half of our program over the next three years will be in, primarily going towards retention, which is going to be predominantly Woodford and some Barnett. The other portion of that will be – is discretionary or what we call impact, and we will be testing and drilling some other wells. So you'll see us start to work up the column. You'll see us start to work the Woodford in the shallower areas, the areas where it's going to be more oily and more liquids rich. So we're excited about those. And there's stuff that's ongoing now and will continue.
Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then my follow up. Steve, you mentioned pulling forward one of the cryogenic processing plants into this year. And maybe I missed it. But how are you able to do that? And what is the timing? Because obviously that'll have a big impact on the liquids mix once that plant is in place. So if you could just, if you can, give any color on now what the timing of that will be to be in place? And how you were able to pull that forward?
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah, sorry, Bob. I may have misled you on that on that comment. To be clear, our original timeline for starting up the first cryo unit was mid-2019. And we're simply looking at an option for bringing that forward in 2019, earlier in 2019. We won't have a cryo unit online before the end of 2018. That's for sure.
Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. So that still has to pull forward. Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor Pickering.
Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Looking at the overall opportunity set in the Midland, Delaware, and Alpine High and just thinking about long term activity levels, what's the right rig count or well count to keep in mind that gets you – again for the long term balance of optimally developing the resource, managing inventory levels, and also appropriately capitalizing when it comes to the infrastructure?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yeah, Jeoff, I mean I think what we've stated is today we like our pace in both places. We've done some strategic tests at the half section level in the Midland Basin. And you're seeing the results of those that we're now integrating into the wells we're drilling now. So it's making a big impact by being able to incorporate the learnings and the data in the work we're doing. Ultimately it boils down to, how do you develop these sections? And we've got to get the completions fully optimized. You've got to get your patterns right, numbers of wells, and those things. And so taking the time to do it, taking the time to analyze the data, and then coming back, because you can always drill more wells, but you can't take away any that you drill. So we like the pace we're on there. I think we're going to be able to accelerate into that as time progresses. The second thing we're doing is you've seen, by getting out and testing the Wolfcamp C, we're testing other benches. And we're also testing other portions of our acreage that – when we've given our location counts in the past, we've been very conservative. We've got a lot of acreage in the southern Midland Basin there that's highly prospective and others would consider core, so some of that's continuing to test those. So you'll see us continue to ramp that activity over time. We can handle many, many more rigs than we're running there today, but we like the pace. And similarly at Alpine High. What's unique about it is we've got 6,000 feet of rock over a 70-mile area. And obviously we're doing what we need to do to earn and hold the acreage, as well as build the infrastructure. And a lot of that pace has been driven by the wet gas side early on, because that's what we need the infrastructure for, to process the wet gas. The oil is easier, and it's also in the shallower zones. So from a pace standpoint, we like where we are. I think when we get something done with the midstream, which we're confident we will do, it's going to give us some more flexibility. So we like the balance we have and what the whole portfolio brings.
Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thanks for that. And then my follow-up is just on the completions optimization you mentioned. Is there any additional detail you can give us on the Midland spacing and stage design side? Any comments on that? And if there's anything else to watch for in terms of testing in the near term would be helpful.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: In general, I'd say just keep watching our results. I mean we've done a lot of work with fiber and a lot of technology that is helping us with things we're doing. We're working on the optimization side. A lot of it has to do with the clusters and some things there, so – and spacing. Not necessarily just more sand. It's just placing it in the right places, doing things to understand our frac geometry and understand the reservoir. And I think once you align those two, you get smarter, and it helps you optimize. I don't know, Tim, if there's anything you want to add?
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Yeah, just a little color to add to that. Really it's allowing us to maximize our available pump time. And the cost reduction, we're seeing about a $220,000 cost reduction per mile of lateral length. So it's very significant. And then of course it reduces the time it takes to get our wells back online. But we've done early results, we've done dip-in fiber, and we've done some modeling work. And we're seeing equivalent or better inflow from these wells. And another thing that we've done also is we paid very close attention to our pad moves. And we've been able to take 20 hours off our pad moves from rigging down to moving to rigging back up. And with 42 pads a year, that's about two months of frac crew time that we can eliminate.
Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Great. Appreciate the detail.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Société Générale.
John P. Herrlin - Société Générale: Yeah, hi. I have some unrelated ones. With respect to the monetization of the Alpine High midstream, are you still planning to keep a large equity stake, because you had mentioned that I think in the past?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yes, John. I mean, clearly, when you look at – and Steve alluded to it in his comments. I mentioned it. We are deep in a process. It is going very well, and there's a tremendous amount of interest. I think the thing that we recognize is, is that this asset is unique, because of the column that we have. We've got 6,000 feet of pay. And really the value of this infrastructure is going to grow significantly over the next five, six, seven, eight years. And so unlike other midstream assets, where you're developing one or two zones, this has a built-in set of wells and capital that's going to drive value. So we will want to hang onto a large piece of the equity and keep that exposure, because ultimately it's our upstream capital that's going to be driving that. So we're very encouraged. I think we're going to be able to maintain control. I think we're going to be able to eliminate the future spend. And I think it's something that's going to be value accretive for our shareholders.
John P. Herrlin - Société Générale: Okay. Great. Next one is on the improvements in the fracking that were mentioned. How much of it was development related, versus how much of it was design related to the well specifically?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, it's – that question, they go hand in hand. Because your design is impacted by your development. And I think that's the point is, is by getting into the pads with the pattern and the spacing test – and I'll say it again. We're doing a lot of things with fiber and a lot of high-end things with the micro size and others and the tracers, which is letting us better understand the frac geometries in what you're doing there. And I think those are the keys is understanding the rock, understanding the well spacing, understanding the number of landing zones. And as we've said, you take the rock. It's not as generic as everybody wants you to believe. You can move over in some areas. Wolfcamp A and B are separate. Some areas are going to communicate. You have to go in and do the work and test the rock and understand it. And I think once you start to grasp where the geometries are, then you can optimize those. So it really goes hand in hand, and it's why we stress the importance of the section and pad level development and return metrics.
John P. Herrlin - Société Générale: Great. Last one on Egypt. When do you think you'll have all the seismic done and processed?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yeah, it's going to take it – we're making good progress, but this is going to be ongoing for quite some time. And we've got two brand new concessions. We're highly excited about what it's going to bring on the new acreage, as well as what the new technology brings on our existing acreage. So you go back and look, Ptah and Berenice were two discoveries we had in late 2014, which really enabled us with the 25, 30 wells to pretty much keep our production flat on the oil side and grow it. So and that's really a strat trap sitting right under our nose out there. So we're really excited about what the new broadband is going to do. And – but it's going to be – it's something we're going to be doing for a while. I mean it's going to go on into 2019, 2020 potentially before we get all of it shot. But we're getting a lot of it back right now. We've high graded the areas. And it's going to have an immediate impact on our drilling programs.
John P. Herrlin - Société Générale: Great. Thanks, John.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Morning, John, to you and your team there.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Good morning, Charles.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Yeah, I wanted to ask, to go back to these – the four-well Chinook pad. And that looks like it was one of the encouraging results out of Alpine High. And I'm wondering if you can elaborate a bit on if that – how those well results fit with what you expected going in? And I imagine you guys are still learning new things at Alpine High and will be for a while. And I'm wondering if you could talk about if your results at Chinook changed anything about the way you guys are seeing the resource there?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, the thing I would say about the Chinook pad, number one is, is in industry vernacular, those would be child wells, because we've already had parent wells in the section. So we're really pleased with it shows you the spacing assumptions. It shows with us getting into the pads. The cost is the big thing. We've always talked about the Woodford, and I think everyone acknowledges it's the best source rock in the world. And so the key here with us and what's going to differentiate Alpine High is going to be the cost structure. And so I think getting well costs down, starting to be able to put the patterns in place, and then seeing the results. And quite frankly, we still are working through the infrastructure build out and bring up. So we got a lot of things on last quarter, but we still don't have everything opened up fully. So well results, they look very good. They're very encouraging. I think spacing, we've been conservative. It kind of confirms we've been conservative on our spacing assumptions. And there's just a lot of rock and a lot of landing zones. And we're thrilled with the results, and those are short laterals too. So...
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful detail, John. And then secondly, this might be going a little bit further down the line. I appreciate your comments about how you guys are going to look at what you're going to do with the extra cash, if and when it shows up. But when you get to the point where you're evaluating adding to capital spending or adding to your activity levels, can you – do you have any thoughts you can share now about where in your portfolio those added dollars and added activity would go?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean clearly it's going to go into returning those dollars to shareholders. And then, two, it's going to go into the discretionary or what we'll call the impact areas. And those are going to be the oilier and more liquids rich portions of Alpine High or into our Midland Basin or Delaware Basin. So those are the areas. We've got a lot of very encouraging results. And we're going to have a pretty big pick menu to choose from, so very excited.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Thank you, John.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Morning, Brian.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Wanted to ask on the CapEx trajectory for the rest of the year, I think you highlighted that one of the reasons for first quarter CapEx being a little higher was some of the efficiencies that you're seeing. You maintained the full year budget. How do you see the rest of the year playing out? And is there a decision that would need to be made if those efficiencies continue in terms of letting that lead to higher CapEx, versus potentially reducing activity?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, first of all, we did come in a little hot. We ended up keeping 100% of Garten. That was the last well we drilled with the WilPhoenix. And I think we all celebrated when we finally ended that three-year rig contract, so that's going to be very helpful going forward in the North Sea on our CapEx numbers. But I mean honestly, one of the other factors is, has been the completion time. And as Tim alluded to, we've eliminated a lot of time in terms of between pad moves and things. And so one of the things is, is you're always seeking to strive that balance, completion crews with rigs and rig count. And efficiencies, they run in – they don't run in parallel all the time. And so our completions have taken a step forward. It's enabled us to choose some days off and pull some wells forward. And we will have a decision to make, if on the drilling side the pace doesn't quicken there, which that could happen as well. Then we will have a decision to make on, do we add another rig or two with our frac crews? So it gives you some flexibility. But we've got some time in the schedules right now. And later this year we'll have to make some – a decision on that.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And then my follow up is back to the midstream monetization. Can you talk at all about the type of long term contracts or commitments that you need to make? And the longevity or magnitude of those to be successful with your monetization plans?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, I think first and foremost is, it's a very thoughtful process where there's a lot of due diligence being done on us, and we're doing a lot of due diligence on the potential partners. So you won't see big volume commitments. You'd see acreage dedication. And quite frankly, you'll see us controlling. So we're open to what the structure looks like. We recognize that the infrastructure investment really should sit in a different structure, where there is a different true cost of capital. We also recognize that we want to maintain as much of that equity as we can, because of the value we're going to create with our capital spend from the upstream side. So I think very creative in the parties we're talking with and the potential structures vary. So but I'm very encouraged by where we are. We're very deep into the process. There's a tremendous amount of interest. And we're very confident that we will do something very attractive in 2018.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Leo Mariani with Nat [National] Alliance.
Leo P. Mariani - National Alliance Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Just wanted to follow quickly on the Garten discovery. You guys talked about having 700 feet of net pay there in multiple reservoirs. Obviously that's a very, very significant number. Is there any type of ballpark contribution that we should think about here? Can this thing do 10,000 barrels a day of oil as we work our way into 2019? Anything you can sort of say along those lines?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Leo, it's very material. I mean we have 700 feet of pay. This is in the Beryl sands, which is some of your most prolific sands there. It's got a lot more scope to the structure than something like Callater has. We did not find the water saturations. We kept drilling and quite frankly, we could've kept drilling deeper. So it's going to be pretty material. And we'll come back with that. We just haven't given any color or any guidance. But you see very high rate wells come on. This will be light oil. And it'll be pretty impactful to our Beryl area. And I think the important thing is we own 100% of it.
Leo P. Mariani - National Alliance Securities LLC: All right. That's helpful. And I guess just (51:15) here. Obviously you guys talked about your methodical plan to really focus a lot on the wet gas in Alpine High in the short term. You got to get those volumes up to get the infrastructure sort of working. But as you kind of think through the three-year plan, just trying to get a sense of whether or not you start to see more of a shift to oil. Is that more of a 2019 move at Alpine High? Or is it more 2020? What can you sort of say about the way you progress the development in terms of phase?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean I think the important thing is, is we've got a very rigorous plan. And as we've stated, we've kind of put Alpine High in three settings. There's actually a couple more than that, but we put it in the Northern Flank, the Crest, and the Southern Flank. And two things I'll say. Number one, the Northern Flank, the acreage is more checkerboarded. So we're drilling shorter laterals. And we have more near term lease obligations. And also is where the dry gas window is at the bottom of the Woodford. So you've seen some of our early capital tilted there. As we move to the Crest and to the Southern Flank, we move up the column. And actually at Alpine High, if you remember, it gets a little cooler in the Southern Flank, which will also yield more liquid and potential for oil. So I think you're going to see just the Woodford and the Barnett, as time moves on, they're going to get more oily. They're going to get more liquids rich. And they're going to get more rich gas. Secondly is, as we've stated there is a lot of proven oil; we've shown that. We had five parasequence wells. There will be more. And quite frankly, with our discretionary capital, we will continue to advance those. And so we've said all along that we plan conservatively with Alpine High. And it will get more oily as time progresses. And you'll see more from us.
Leo P. Mariani - National Alliance Securities LLC: All right. Thanks, guys.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Good morning, John. Morning, everybody.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Good morning.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: John, I've got one on the Permian and one on Egypt, if I may. So starting with the Permian, the comment you made about Wolfcamp C and expanding the inventory. Obviously you're clearly doing the right thing delineating and securing your acreage in Alpine High. But at what point would you have greater flexibility? Because obviously, when you started this process, oil wasn't trading where it is with the kind of differentials we're seeing. So I'm just curious how you think about on a sort of one-, two-, three-year view, how your incremental spending will switch between the Midland/Permian versus the Delaware/Permian, given the increase, potential increase on location gap?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, there's no doubt over time you will see more from us on the incremental side. It's going to be going in two places. It's going to be going into the oil zones at Alpine High. It'll also be going into the Midland Basin. And part of that, Doug, is making sure we have the infrastructure in place in both places, where we are maximizing the returns. Because in the end, it's the returns that matter more than the top-line oil production. And so the beautiful thing about Alpine High is, is that we have exposure to dry gas, wet gas, and obviously oil, and a lot of rich gas. And clearly, as we get the infrastructure in place, and we get more of the infrastructure in the Midland Basin in place, then we're going to have the flexibility to toggle and put that in incrementally, where we think it's going to drive the best returns.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I don't want to labor the point, but obviously oil is up a bit. You've been extremely capital disciplined. But it seems you have a lot – like you did today. It seems you've got a lot more flexibility to pivot to the oil opportunities you have today. So are you sticking with your spending budget? Or were you tempted to pivot a little bit more to oil in the near term?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Today, what we reiterated is our spending budget. And we came in a little hot, as we said, on the completion side. And if we were to change that, we would obviously come back and give you some guidance on that. But today, that's what our – we increased our guidance on our current CapEx budget. It is going to be a little more oily because of the performance that we're seeing. And clearly, we've got things that we can do. So it's a good situation.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I appreciate that. Yeah. So my follow-up, and hopefully I won't take too much time on this. But a few years ago, actually probably it was seven or eight years ago, we published a detailed report on Egypt talking about how you had cracked the code of seismic and the legacy you had there and so on. And my question is really about in this oil price environment, I think most people think of Egypt as a cash cow to feed the onshore U.S. I'm just curious how you think about Egypt's relative competitiveness as potentially a more meaningful growth area. We don't normally think about conventional location turnout (56:36), at least I don't think U.S. investors do in the way – the context of the Permian. But what is the opportunity set like? And why wouldn't you accelerate, given the very favorable PSC you have over there? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean clearly, Doug, you hit on one of the key points. I mean Egypt is great rock. It's kind of Permian with conventional delivery. And clearly with two discoveries, Ptah and Berenice, we're producing tremendous volumes over a three-year period and still are today, about 30,000 barrels a day. We think we see Egypt as a place where we can continue to grow the oil volume and grow the cash flow. And so we think it's a place we can have our cake and eat it too. And that's why we are investing in a new state-of-the-art 3D, and I think it will uncover many, many opportunities that we can tie back into infrastructure. So we see Egypt as an area that in the future we can do both, grow and grow the free cash flow.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: John, how quickly do you get your money back in the PSC?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It depends on the well. Some of those are very, very short.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple quick ones on my end. I guess first on the Wolfcamp C result in the Midland Basin, commentary there of several hundred additional potential locations from that well. I'm just curious, like what other work you've done on your acreage to assess the Wolfcamp C? And what sort of follow-up activity we should expect on that front?
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Yeah, Michael. First of all, we're very excited about the well. There have not been a lot of Wolfcamp C wells drilled to date. Keep in mind that this is just a mile lateral and had good 30-day IP. But we've mapped the Wolfcamp C. And we've got tens of thousands of acres underlying it. So we feel very comfortable that we're going to have quite a bit of inventory that will spin off from this. But as I mentioned, it's very early days, and we're still evaluating.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Any plan in the near term to follow up that initial result with additional tests?
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Yeah, we're going to evaluate this well right now. This is at Azalea. And we've got other areas that we do want to test the Wolfcamp C as well.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Okay. And then another topic I guess, just following up on the infrastructure or the marketing detail you provided. On the gas side I'm just curious, those percentages that you provided, are those on current volumes, planned volumes? Or how should we think about those?
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Those are planned annualized volumes for 2018. For the full year.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Okay. And what are the term lengths on the contracts and dedicated sales? Any color you can provide there?
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah, they're all over the place. It's a whole portfolio of contracts, because this is the entire Permian Basin.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Sure.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: What we provided in this, and just to be really clear, is that any contract that expired or would expire during this year is included in the uncommitted – that portion of it is included in the uncommitted production wedge.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude our Q&A portion for today's call. And I would like to turn the call back over to CEO John Christmann for any closing remarks.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, and finally, I'd like to thank you all for joining us today. I want to leave you with three key takeaways. First, Apache's off to a great start in 2018. We established a new Permian Basin production record, exceeded U.S. production guidance in the first quarter, and raised our outlook for the remainder of the year. Second, we are realizing greater capital efficiency through cost control and continuous productivity improvement. This is a direct outcome of our methodical approach to delineation and development, our application of technology, and our measured activity pace in the Permian Basin. And lastly, we are very pleased with our progress toward completion of an Alpine High midstream transaction, which will enable us to return additional capital to shareholders and/or increase our upstream investment program. That will include today's call. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Gary and his team. And we look forward to reporting on our progress next quarter.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call, and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Thea, and I will be the conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Gary Clark. Please go ahead.
Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's fourth quarter 2017 financial and operational results conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; Executive Vice President of Operations Support, Tim Sullivan; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Steve Riney. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our fourth quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. On today's conference call we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Also please note that with our exit from Canada, forward guidance and future quarterly reporting will refer to the United States or the U.S., and we will no longer use the term North America. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. Our prepared remarks will run a bit longer today, as we have a lot of information to cover with fourth quarter and full year results, as well as our three-year outlook. So we will extend this call past 2 o'clock in order to accommodate 30 minutes of Q&A. And I will now turn the call over to John.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will begin by discussing Apache's approach to the current environment. Then I will highlight our 2017 accomplishments and provide an overview of the fourth quarter before turning it over to Tim and Steve for more details. And finally, I will close with commentary on our 2018 to 2020 outlook. Early in 2015, we focused Apache on a path that creates real value for our shareholders over the long term and through the commodity cycles. The foundation was underpinned by cost and capital discipline. And we linked our compensation plans accordingly. This approach has driven our actions through a very challenging period. Specifically, we have streamlined our portfolio, reduced capital investment, increased capital productivity and efficiency, and reset the corporate and operating cost structure. By choice, we allowed production to decline rather than chase growth in an environment that was mostly value destructive. This disciplined approach enabled us to cost effectively lease and quietly discover a world-class unconventional resource of scale and to direct our limited additional investments to improving long-term returns. We were also able to maintain our dividend, while many in the industry were reduced or eliminated. Moreover, we strengthened our balance sheet by reducing debt and avoided diluting our shareholders' long-term value by electing not to issue equity to pursue expensive acreage acquisitions or to fund an outsized capital program. We have been clear in our belief that an E&P company, over the long term and through the commodity cycles, must be able to do the three things that leading companies in mature industries do, live within cash flows, grow the enterprise through prudent investment, and return capital to shareholders through a competitive dividend and/or share repurchases. This is the path that Apache is on now. And we have assembled the team and the portfolio to do so for decades to come. Our current investment programs are directed at building the optionality over the next few years to maximize the value of that portfolio. Specifically, at Alpine High we are building out a world class resource play that will change the course of Apache. The expanse of the opportunity in terms of acreage and hydrocarbon column will drive capital investment and very soon, free cash flow for decades to come. The capital program in short order will bring forth the capacity to deliver oil, gas, and NGLs at scale to the rapidly growing market on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The midstream infrastructure capital program at Alpine High is a critical piece to the story for the near term. We must strategically control the build-out of the infrastructure to meet the needs of the upstream. We do not need to own 100% of these assets for the long term though. And we are studying strategic alternatives that will ensure we capture the value we are creating and will free up cash flow by eliminating future capital. In the Permian Basin, outside of Alpine High, we have proven the quality of our inventory and are now well-positioned to profitably grow oil volumes for many years to come. Internationally, the North Sea and Egypt are very well-positioned to serve their primary strategic purpose, provide free cash flows back to the corporation for many years to come. And we still have a tremendous amount of running room. In Egypt, we've increased our acreage footprint by 40% with two new concessions and are conducting a large scale broadband 3D seismic survey that will set up growth opportunities for the future. In the North Sea, we have a sizable inventory of development locations and exploration prospects around our existing infrastructure. And in Suriname, we have two highly prospective blocks that are on trend with recent discoveries in an emerging world class oil basin. In the relatively near future, we will have significant optionality across the portfolio, especially in the Permian Basin, to direct investment across an extensive highly economic portfolio to produce oil, gas, or NGLs. At that time, the Permian Basin will be generating substantial free cash flow, which will bring another dimension of optionality. Those cash flows could be directed to any of the following, further accelerate the pace of Permian development, fund growth opportunities outside of the Permian, which may have been deferred due to Alpine High funding requirements, and return of capital to our shareholders. The future allocation and prioritization of how those cash flows will be utilized will be determined by what we deem to be in the best long-term interest of our shareholders. This is the strategic direction of Apache today. 2018 promises to be a very interesting year. Our industry is at a critical inflection point following three years of depressed commodity prices and disappointing returns in terms of both return on and return of capital. Today, we are in a more constructive oil price environment. And the market is watching carefully to determine whether E&P companies will maintain discipline and focus on long-term returns or revert to the historical norm of a singular focus on top line growth. For the industry to adopt a more rational approach to balancing optimal risk adjusted returns and growth, management incentives must be appropriately aligned. Consistent with that, investors are now seeking key changes to executive incentive compensation programs. Shareholders are advocating for the inclusion of absolute return metrics and programs historically more heavily weighted toward relative returns performance. They are also insisting that growth related metrics be calculated on a debt adjusted per-share basis. As I indicated, Apache restructured its compensation philosophy three years ago that clearly linked our long-term compensation as closely as possible with long-term shareholder value. It was also the best way to align our entire organization with our strategic direction. Specifically, our long-term incentive program has taken a balanced approach, with 50% based on relative TSR and the other 50% based on two metrics, which are highly correlated with absolute returns. The targets for these latter metrics are agreed with the board on an annual basis and reflect corporate objectives that are consistent with the economic environment at the time and the context of the long-term strategy of the company. We align those metrics every year. And therefore, they have no inherent bias for subjective growth targets. Turning now to our 2017 highlights. It was a great year of progress for Apache, marked by several important advancements that position us for strong performance in the years ahead. Following two years of curtailed capital investment, our Permian Basin production volumes entered 2017 in decline. Notwithstanding this slowdown, we have made and continue to make significant progress on many fronts, consolidating our land position; investing in science, data collection, and strategic testing; improving our drilling and completion capabilities; confirming additional landing zones; conducting important pattern and spacing tests at the section or half-section level; and testing shallow zones at Alpine High and other unconventional oil opportunities in the U.S. In 2017, we returned the Permian Basin to a growth trajectory, exclusive of Alpine High, with a relatively limited capital program. And clearly demonstrated that Apache possesses high-quality acreage and can deliver leading well results. Notably, our total Permian Basin production reached a record high in the fourth quarter, exceeding the previous high set two years ago in the fourth quarter of 2015. This achievement occurred just two quarters after Permian production reached a four-year low in mid-2017. As a result of the operational progress we made and the now proven quality of our inventory, we anticipate sustained, high return growth from the Permian for many years to come. In the Midland Basin, we have both a technology and execution success story. We are applying state-of-the-art capabilities to reduce drilling and completion time, locate wells more effectively within landing zones, and more efficiently stimulate the productive interval. In the second half of 2017, we began to significantly increase our average lateral length, which will continue into 2018, as 85% of our wells are planned for 1.5-to-2-mile laterals. We are very excited about our recent Midland Basin results and will continue to advance and leverage these key learnings for the future. At Alpine High, we initiated first production ahead of schedule in May and ramped production volumes steadily through the year, as we commissioned infrastructure and connected wells. We increased our inventory of risk locations to more than 5,000 and initiated our first true multi-well pads and pattern tests, which will drive increasing capital efficiencies into the 2018 program and beyond. We are pleased with these results and have begun to climb the learning curve with our development program, which will deliver well cost and productivity improvements in the future. Internationally, as I mentioned earlier, we added significant new acreage in Egypt. And we are moving forward with our exploration program in Suriname. Both of these areas bring significant future prospectivity to Apache. In 2017, we implemented a number of cutting edge technology initiatives across our operational footprint. The continued evolution and application of technology is vital to our industry. It will drive efficiency gains, inventory expansion, higher returns, and performance differentiation among E&P companies. Apache has long been a leader in technological innovation. And the recent addition of Mark Meyer as Senior Vice President of Energy Technology Strategies underscores the strategic importance of these initiatives. Lastly, I note the excellent progress we made in the ongoing reshaping of our portfolio. We took advantage of the active market for leasehold in the Permian by divesting some non-core acreage packages at very attractive prices. We also completed our strategic exit from Canada. These actions, combined with the ongoing investment at Alpine High, represent a large scale, multiyear portfolio rotation that will be extremely accretive to capital efficiency, recycle ratios, and most importantly, long-term returns. Moving now to fourth quarter results, Apache finished the year on a positive note with its second consecutive quarter of profitability. In the fourth quarter, we delivered strong adjusted EBITDA and cash flow, demonstrating our leverage to improving oil prices. Operating and G&A costs decreased from the third quarter on a unit basis. Capital spending was on plan. And U.S. production was at the high end of our guidance range. Internationally, we had some mixed results. Both Egypt and the North Sea benefited from improved Brent pricing and delivered combined cash flow from operations of nearly $0.5 billion and significant free cash flow. In Egypt, we continued to deliver excellent drilling results and achieved more than a 90% success rate during the quarter on 25 new wells. In the North Sea, following a long run of success, we encountered a few challenges. An unscheduled shutdown of the Forties Pipeline System, an unexpectedly tight producing formation in our CB1 Callater offset well, and an exploration dry hole on a long standing obligation well combined for a disappointing quarter. The result was lower production volumes in the quarter and a lower trajectory going into 2018. Despite these setbacks, the North Sea remains a vital, high return business for Apache. We have two existing discoveries in development planning and a deep inventory of attractive tie-back prospects. In the U.S., we had a very strong quarter. All of our growth came from the Permian Basin, where production increased 10% over the third quarter. At Alpine High, we commissioned our fifth central processing facility at the Hidalgo site and achieved our year-end production target of 25,000 BOEs per day. This flow rate was temporary, as we subsequently shut-in some production for a scheduled expansion at the Dakota central processing facilities. For the quarter, production averaged 20,000 BOEs per day. Midland and Delaware Basin oil production exceeded the high end of the guidance range we established a year ago. This was driven by a combination of strong well performance, a significant number of new wells placed online in the Delaware Basin, and timing of some high impact, half-section spacing tests in the Midland Basin. With that summary of our fourth quarter results, I will now turn the call over to Tim, who will discuss operational details of the fourth quarter and our 2018 activity plans.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Thank you, John. My remarks today will include operational activity in key wells in our U.S. and international regions, planned activity levels by play for 2018, and I'll conclude with commentary about the use of new technology throughout the organization. Operationally, we had a good year and continue to improve in key areas. Our fourth quarter production results continue the growth trajectory established in the third quarter. In the U.S., fourth quarter production averaged 222,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 7% from the third quarter. U.S. oil production increased to 98,000 barrels of oil per day, an 8% increase from the preceding period. Much of this growth was driven by continued success in the Midland Basin. At the Powell field in Upton County, we brought online 20 wells from three pads with an average 30-day peak IP of nearly 1,400 BOE per day. These wells were drilled to the Wolfcamp B formation and are comprised of 1.5- and 2-mile laterals, producing in excess of 75% oil. These are half-section spacing and pattern tests, designed to methodically and scientifically determine the optimal development plan for the area. We continued to make good progress on drilling, completion, and cost optimization, as we use capital more efficiently with larger well pads and longer laterals. In the Midland Basin, we have reduced drilling and completion costs 20% over the last 12 months on a treated lateral foot basis, while production volumes improved 17%. These results give us confidence that we can continue to improve here and elsewhere in the Permian Basin. As John mentioned, we are moving to more pad operations at Alpine High. The Dogwood State pad is a six-well spacing test located in the northern flank and was selected due to retention requirements. These are dry gas wells on 660-foot spacing drilled in the Barnett and the Woodford formations to a total vertical depth below 13,000 feet. This pad has produced more than 2 Bcf in just 49 days and is currently producing approximately 75 million cubic feet per day. In the Central Crest, the two-well Elbert State pad drilled the Woodford formation at a TVD of approximately 9,800 feet, nearly 4,000 feet shallower than the Dogwood [State] pad. As projected from our thermal maturity model, these wells produce wet gas and oil and averaged a 30-day peak IP of 1,175 BOE per day with an oil-gas ratio greater than 60 barrels per million cubic feet. Drill, complete, and equip costs for this two-well pad averaged $6.2 million per well. As we move to pad operations at Alpine High, we are realizing the benefit of reducing cost and increasing efficiencies. On the drilling side, these include using less expensive spudder rigs to drill the surface and intermediate hole; batch drilling operations with walking rigs; casing design optimization with standardized production casing, and in some areas, the elimination of an intermediate casing string; substituting oil-based muds with less expensive brine drilling systems; customized bit and bottom hole assemblies; and the use of rotary steerable equipment to increase penetration rates in the lateral section. These efforts have reduced spud-to-TD times in some cases to under 15 days. On the completion side, pad operations have also led to the following cost and performance benefits, pumping more frac stages per day, optimized sand loading to pattern size, recycled and brackish water use, higher pump rates allowing for gel elimination requiring lower horsepower, and pads also allow us to verify confined stimulation intervals with tracers and micro-seismic. Through these efforts, we have brought down our costs considerably, and we expect costs to continue to decrease from an average of $8 million last year, where we were heavily invested in science and data collection, to $6 million this year. Ultimately, we anticipate well costs will be closer to the lower end of the $4 million to $6 million range we provided in 2016. Elsewhere in the Delaware Basin, we brought online seven wells in our Dixieland field in Reeves County and five wells in Eddy County. These wells have targeted four separate landing zones in the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp formations with impressive peak 30-day IPs ranging from 1,100 to nearly 2,200 BOE per day. And in the Anadarko Basin, we completed the Scott 33, a five-well pad in the Woodford SCOOP play. These mile laterals are producing in excess of 1,700 BOE per day with an oil-gas ratio in excess of 50 barrels per million cubic feet. Drill, complete, and equip costs for this pad averaged approximately $8 million per well. Internationally, our Egypt and North Sea regions continued to generate excellent free cash flow, benefiting from the recent price increase for Brent Index crude oil. In Egypt, highlights for the quarter include the Ptah 18, a development well in the Faghur Basin with a 30-day IP in excess of 3,400 BOE per day, all oil. Also, two exploration tests in the Matruh Basin, the Herunefer West-4X and the Chelsea-1X, were both discoveries in the upper Safa formation with a combined test rate in excess of 14,000 BOE per day, producing 58% oil. Both wells set up additional development and step-out exploration opportunities. For the full year, Egypt delivered a success rate greater than 80%, completing 88 net wells, of which 40 had test rates greater than 1,000 BOE per day with 87% oil. These are low-cost vertical completions and generate very attractive returns. In the North Sea, fourth quarter production averaged 58,000 BOE per day, as volumes from the Forties field were impacted by the unscheduled shutdown at the third-party operated Forties Pipeline System. The Callater field, a subsea tieback to the Beryl facilities, came online in mid-2017, and with the addition of the recently drilled CB1 well is currently producing on a gross basis 17,000 BOE per day, 43% oil. Please refer to our financial and operational supplement for more details on the fourth quarter. Now I will move to our 2018 capital program, beginning with the U.S. The Permian Basin remains the focus of our activity in the year ahead, with approximately $1.6 billion being directed to this region, or roughly two-thirds of our annual upstream budget. We plan to operate 13 to 15 rigs during the year, with six to seven at Alpine High, three elsewhere in the Delaware Basin, and four to five in the Midland Basin. We also expect to run four to six frac crews during the year, split primarily between Alpine High and in the Midland Basin. At Alpine High, we plan to drill 85 to 95 wells during 2018. And this will comprise approximately 50% development retention wells and 50% delineation wells. For perspective, to date we have drilled a total of 118 wells at Alpine High, of which 48 were online and producing at year end. Our retention program is crucial, as competitor activity around us has increased significantly, with more than 170 wells drilled or permitted by other operators since we announced Alpine High in September 2016. Importantly, drilling to the deeper Woodford formation allows Apache to retain drilling rights for all zones above it. Additionally, the wells drilled to the deeper source rock provide data needed to optimize the build-out of our infrastructure and shape the full field development plan at Alpine High. In the Permian Basin outside of Alpine High, we are planning a balanced drilling program of approximately 55 to 60 wells in the Midland Basin and 45 to 50 wells in the Delaware Basin. While we plan to drill a similar number of wells as last year, our average laterals will be increasing. And we expect to drill 15% more total lateral footage. These plays are predominantly oil. Our capital program for the international regions reflect their role in our portfolio as free cash flow generators to fund reinvestment in the Permian Basin. Our 2018 planned capital investment here is approximately $690 million. This will provide for continued cash flow generation from Egypt and the North Sea regions, though we expect some natural field decline at this investment level. Our 2018 capital program anticipates a moderate level of service cost inflation, approximately 10%, and we are managing this carefully. We have already contracted most of our rigs, pumping services, and sand required to execute the plan in the year ahead, avoiding the premium being paid currently with ramped up activity for many services. Higher costs are more likely to be seen in ancillary services in the Midland and Delaware Basins and will be more difficult to offset because of industry-wide activity levels. In spite of the inflationary trends, we are well-positioned at Alpine High for a step-change reduction in our cost profile as we scale up our business. Throughout our organization, we are applying new technologies and creating new tools that are improving how we work. These apply to subsurface, drilling and completions, production, and supply logistics groups. We are increasingly applying big data analytics across the company. We continue to lead the way in the development and application of simultaneous seismic sources, both onshore and offshore, the result of which has allowed us to save millions of dollars in exploration costs, greatly reduce the time to collect, process, interpret data, and realize large improvements in data quality. We have developed a drilling intelligence guide app that gathers high-frequency data from sensors on the rig for use in prediction and avoidance of downhole issues. We have also developed workflows and developed technologies that allow us to rapidly characterize thousands of feet of core and quickly get this information into the hands of the project geologists and reservoir engineers for rapid characterization of our shale plays and landing zones. Along with our ongoing efforts on oil fingerprinting, we are building a far more robust understanding of our shale plays and their performance. We're using multiple sources, such as fiber optics, micro-seismic, and 4D seismic, all of which are providing unprecedented insight into our formation stimulations, leading to optimized reservoir development. We've built new state-of-the-art water treatment facilities, including highly engineered water storage pits, both in the Midland Basin and Alpine High areas, that directly add value to our projects by reducing water costs and in increasing both reliability and flexibility in our operations. We're using remote operating centers that utilize real-time data to optimize well performance, allowing immediate reactions to changing circumstances. These data-driven decisions help deliver operational improvements and increase efficiency. The combination of data analytics technologies and advanced machine learning inform and validate our decision-making processes and operational strategies. As John mentioned, we expect technology will play an increasingly vital role in our future exploration and development progress. In conclusion, 2017 was a very good year. We achieved 124% production replacement rate from E&D adds net of engineering revisions. We returned to growth in the Permian Basin, advanced Alpine High, and generated robust free cash flow from our international regions. 2018 will be an extension of these efforts, as we continue our operating and capital cost discipline and our commitment to returns-focused growth. I will now turn the call over to Steve.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Tim. Today I will highlight Apache's fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results, discuss our 2018 outlook, comment on cash returns and return on capital employed, update our Alpine High midstream progress, and briefly review our hedge positions. Before I get to these details, let me first review a few of the company's key financial achievements in 2017. Apache returned to profitability in 2017, both on a GAAP reported basis and on an adjusted earnings basis. We reduced our absolute level of debt and our net debt, ending the year with more cash on hand than we began with. We retained our investment-grade credit rating. We returned nearly $400 million of capital to shareholders through the dividend. And asset sales generated $1.4 billion of proceeds and eliminated approximately $800 million of future asset retirement obligations. In 2018, we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, direct our capital investments for value and long-term returns, and take important next steps to progress Alpine High into full operational mode, so we can return to living within cash flows as we prefer. Through all of this, we will also continue to return capital to our shareholders, which is an underappreciated aspect of Apache. Over the last three years, we've returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders through the dividend. For the next three years, we plan to return at least this amount, and possibly more, through the dividend or through share buybacks. Turning to our fourth quarter and full-year results, as noted in our press release this morning, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported fourth quarter 2017 net income of $456 million or $1.19 per diluted common share. Results for the quarter include a number of items that are outside of core earnings and are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates. The most significant of these is a $306 million deferred income tax benefit from U.S. tax reform. Excluding this and other less material items, our adjusted earnings for the quarter were $126 million or $0.33 per share. For the full year 2017, Apache reported GAAP net income of $1.3 billion or $3.41 per share. And adjusted earnings of $92 million or $0.24 per share. With respect to U.S. tax reform, the $306 million tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter reflects the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017. This represents the combined impact from the deemed repatriation provision and the reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. This is a provisional assessment of the U.S. tax reform. And we continue to assess its full impact. Importantly, as we have indicated in the past, Apache is not currently a cash taxpayer in the U.S. And given the carryforward of certain tax attributes, we do not anticipate this changing in the foreseeable future. In terms of operational and financial results, key items such as North American and international production volumes, capital expenditures, LOE, DD&A, and G&A were consistent with or better than our latest guidance. Capital spending was $862 million for the fourth quarter and $3.1 billion for the full year. Throughout 2017, we further strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity position, ending the year with net debt of $6.8 billion and cash on hand of $1.7 billion. Let me turn now briefly to 2018. We have provided more detailed guidance for the year in today's fourth quarter financial and operational supplement. I won't go through each component, but would like to highlight a few key items. Our capital budget for 2018 is $3 billion, which is down slightly from 2017. We plan to invest $2.5 billion in the upstream and $500 million in Alpine High midstream. At current pricing, the upstream will be approximately cash flow neutral, inclusive of the current company dividend of $380 million. The midstream will operate at a cash flow deficit of approximately $500 million. This deficit could be significantly reduced or even completely eliminated in the event of a funding transaction involving the Alpine High midstream assets. It is anticipated that any cash flow deficit for 2018 will be funded through cash on hand. For the year, Apache's adjusted production is expected to increase by 7% to 13%, consisting of 19% to 24% growth in the U.S. and a 3% to 10% decline internationally. Oil production in the Permian Basin is projected to grow by approximately 9%. For the first quarter of 2018, U.S. production is expected to be around 223,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Adjusted international production is expected to average 135,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. So the first quarter will be flat to slightly down from the fourth quarter, before we return to a growth profile that will deliver the 7% to 13% increase for the full year that I just mentioned. This is the result of several factors, including timing of pad completions in the Midland Basin, as we placed three pads into production during the fourth quarter of 2017, but we only have one pad planned for the first quarter of 2018; mechanical compression issues on one of our Beryl facilities and further temporary outages at the Forties Pipeline System in the North Sea; production curtailment in the Permian Basin due to weather impacts and a temporary shutdown to rebuild a tank battery in the Midland Basin; and Brent crude pricing impacts on our Egypt volumes as a result of our production sharing contracts. From a capital and expense perspective, first quarter should generally run at a quarterly pace of around 25% of the full year dollar guidance ranges. Exceptions to this would be capital expenditures will be around $800 million, cash exploration costs will be around $50 million, G&A expense will be around $120 million, and financing costs will be around $105 million. Let me turn now to a discussion of returns, which as you know, is integral to how we manage our business. For three years now, we have been consistent in our approach to capital allocations. We fund opportunities that we believe will maximize long-term value and optimize long-term returns. To reinforce this, we added a cash return on invested capital metric to our annual incentive compensation plan. We outline the specifics of how we intend to calculate this metric in our financial and operational supplement. For 2018, we have established a cash return on invested capital target of 18%. Our performance against this target accounts for 20% of the entire company's annual incentive compensation. This measure of returns should improve by about 2% per year for the next few years. Another important measure of returns we watch closely is return on capital employed. Just like the cash return on invested capital goal, we have added a strategic goal related to ROCE on our 2018 incentive compensation plan. That goal is to implement a long-term plan that returns the company to sustainable double digit ROCE. Everybody has a preferred methodology for calculating ROCE with the most significant differences arising from the use of pre- versus post-tax income in the numerator and gross versus net debt in the denominator. Our preferred method is a numerator using adjusted earnings before interest and taxes and a denominator using average debt plus average shareholder equity. Using this methodology, at flat pricing from today, our 2020 ROCE is projected to be around 10%. And this will continue to improve for the next several years after 2020. With the required start-up investment at Alpine High, improving ROCE will take some time. Embedded in our forecasted ROCE is the assumption we continue to own, operate, and fund 100% of the Alpine High midstream infrastructure. Although strategically critical and valuable, these investments tend to hold back returns as measured by accounting metrics. A transaction involving these assets could materially improve these ROCE estimates. The upstream investment in due course will become the long-term engine for dramatically improving ROCE. While Alpine High may take a bit of time to attain critical mass, with its extremely low entry cost and attractive recycle ratios, it will drive significantly improved ROCE for Apache Corporation for many years to come. Next I would like to provide some color on our Alpine High midstream operations, where we continue to make steady progress on multiple fronts. Construction on these facilities began in November 2016. And the progress we have made in a little over a year is remarkable. Currently, we are operating 110 miles of gathering line, 45 miles of 30-inch trunk line, 21 central tank batteries, and 5 central processing facilities with inlet capacity of 330 million cubic feet per day. By the end of 2018, we anticipate reaching 830 million cubic feet per day of inlet processing capacity. During the year, we plan to commence installation of centralized cryogenic processing facilities, which will add another 600 million cubic feet per day of capacity in 2019. We have also begun implementing a takeaway strategy with the signing of an agreement with Kinder Morgan to access capacity on their Gulf Coast Express long-haul gas project from the Waha Hub to Agua Dulce near the Texas Gulf Coast. This agreement includes an option to participate in the project on an equity basis, which we believe will prove valuable to the midstream enterprise for the long term. You can anticipate similar arrangements on the NGL and oil sides in the future. We recognize there is a wide variety of long-term strategic options for the Alpine High midstream assets, and we are giving these careful consideration. The inherent value of these assets comes from the massive long-term flow of hydrocarbons from Alpine High and the optionality that will create along the value chain. Numerous parties have approached us with some very interesting ideas of how they might join us in the build-out of the midstream business. While it is likely these assets will end up in an enterprise separate from Apache, for both funding and for value optimization reasons, we currently anticipate owning a significant share of this enterprise for the long term. Before turning the call back to John, I'll comment briefly on our hedging program. As a reminder, we do not engage in hedging to speculate on price. The purpose of our hedging program is to protect cash flows to fund the capital program at Alpine High. For 2018, an average of 85,500 barrels of oil production per day currently have some form of hedging protection. 47% is in the form of puts, 37% is in collars, some with upside call options, and 16% is in the form of swaps. All of these hedge positions give the desired downside protection, and nearly 70% retain some form of upside potential, which we generally prefer. While our cash flow sensitivity to natural gas price movements is considerably less than for oil, we did recognize risks associated with certain types of gas exposure. As such, we entered into both NYMEX gas price swaps and Waha basis swaps to eliminate some of the uncertainty. To date, we have swapped an average of 237 million BTUs per day of NYMEX gas price exposure for 2018 at a weighted average price of $3.07. With respect to Waha basis, for all of 2018 and the first half of 2019, we have entered into swaps for an average of 156 million BTUs per day at an average basis differential of $0.51. We have also entered into a small number of Waha basis swaps for the second half of 2019. The details on all of our hedge positions can be seen in our financial and operational supplement. This time of year, we also typically provide updated guidance on our cash flow sensitivity to changes in commodity prices. For 2018, we estimate that a $5 change in oil price impacts cash flow by approximately $350 million. A $0.30 change in gas price impacts cash flow by approximately $65 million. Both of these estimates exclude the effect of our hedge positions. I would like to conclude by noting Apache's continued financial strength and flexibility. We entered 2018 with $1.7 billion of cash, $150 million of which we used to fund debt maturities earlier this month. We have an additional $400 million of debt maturing in September, which we will also retire using cash on hand. We will continue to balance the great confidence we have in our current investment programs with our overarching desire to live within cash flows. We have purposefully created the liquidity to fund the near-term outspend because it will maximize long-term value for our shareholders. While this will be a small and short-lived outspend, we are exploring all options for minimizing or eliminating it entirely. We will also continue to take advantage of the flexibility our portfolio provides on the capital program outside of Alpine High. We will maintain the planning and operational flexibility to manage these programs as market conditions dictate. I'll now turn the call back over to John for a discussion of our three-year outlook.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Steve. Before we move on to Q&A, I'd like to comment on the 2018 to 2020 outlook we provided in this morning's press release. Over the next three years, we plan to invest a total of approximately $7.5 billion in the upstream, with just under $2.5 billion budgeted for 2018 and increasing slightly through to 2020. Additionally, we expect to invest $1 billion in the midstream build-out at Alpine High over the next three years. This will include around $500 million in 2018 and another $500 million split evenly between 2019 and 2020. As we have made clear, we are exploring funding alternatives for our midstream assets and are working to eliminate some or all of this capital from our three-year plan. I cannot overstate the strategic importance of the midstream solution at Alpine High. The optimal outcome requires a deliberate and thoughtful approach, highly integrated with the upstream development plan, and we are investing the necessary time and resources to get it right. The outcome of this capital program is a projected compound annual growth rate of 11% to 13% for Apache as a whole and 19% to 22% in the U.S. over the next three years, which will be accompanied by very solid returns. This growth will be driven almost entirely by the Permian, which we project to grow at a compound rate of 26% to 28%. Our international operations in Egypt and the North Sea will continue to be free cash contributors. For the last two years, we have been investing below our $700 million to $900 million maintenance capital rate. As a result, we have seen international production volumes decline. And for now, we anticipate they will continue on a shallow decline rate, given our planned investment levels. In the North Sea, however, we do anticipate improving capital efficiency, as our high day rate contract on the Ocean Patriot semi-submersible rolls down to a significantly lower rate in mid-2018. We feel good about the long-term strategic direction of Egypt and the North Sea, and industry activity is picking up in both regions. I'd like to take a few minutes now and focus specifically on our three-year Permian Basin investment plan. As you know, Apache has one of the largest acreage footprints in the Permian, and it is our largest-producing region. From 2018 to 2020, we plan to invest approximately two-thirds of our upstream capital in the Permian, consisting of $2.5 billion in Alpine High and $2.5 billion in the Midland Basin, other Delaware Basin, and Central Basin Platform combined. Outside of Alpine High, we will focus our capital program on horizontal oil drilling in the Midland and Delaware Basins and on moderating our Central Basin Platform decline rate through water flood and EOR projects. With the advancements made over the last three years that Tim discussed, the capital program in these areas is becoming both more efficient and more productive. We have the inventory to significantly increase this investment level, especially in the Midland Basin, if our objective was to simply maximize short-term oil growth. However, a deeper understanding of multi-zone reservoir dynamics on a section level will lead to much more economic full development decisions for the long term. This section-level approach requires the collection and analysis of massive amounts of data to fully understand the complex, inter-well, inter-zone physics. Our current rig and completion pace allow sufficient time to collect and analyze this data and design and implement optimal spacing and pattern configurations across our acreage position. After we complete this important work, then we will look to accelerate our Permian development pace in the context of available cash flow. With nearly all of our key Midland Basin acreage held by production, we have the luxury of utilizing time and technology to ensure long-term value maximization of our Permian acreage. The industry is just beginning to understand the dynamics of downspacing, inter-well and cross-landing zone communications, and long-term reservoir performance of multi-well pads. Apache's goal is to stay at the forefront of that understanding. Turning to Alpine High, Apache has the unique opportunity to advance a low-cost greenfield play of enormous scale. We are confident it will become a long-term, high -return, free cash flow generating asset for decades to come. In the context of today's commodity price, we acknowledge that funding a wet gas play is a bit contrarian, but it is justified by the long-term scale and return potential, even at lower gas prices. With 340,000 contiguous net acres, up to 6,000 feet of hydrocarbon columns spanning the full range from dry gas to oil, relatively high permeability, low clay content, and generally over-pressured true organic shale formations, the potential of the play is very compelling. Our investment plan for Alpine High upstream over the next three years assumes an average of 6.5 rigs in 2018, increasing to 10 rigs in 2020. During 2018, approximately 50% of the drilling program will focus on wrapping up the primary phase of delineation and testing. The rest of the three-year drilling program can be roughly split 50:50 between retention drilling and impact development drilling. The key to success for Alpine High will be its cost structure, both on a capital and operational basis. We have already made great progress on drilling costs. But over time, well design optimization, pad drilling, and pattern development are expected to drive Alpine High's average completed well cost down into the $4 million to $6 million range, resulting in very attractive F&D costs. The Woodford, Barnett, and Pennsylvanian source rock are also true shales, which means they contain little to no in situ formation water. With minimal water handling costs, Alpine High will have extremely low operating costs. We are projecting a steady decrease in lease operating expenses over the next three years to less than $2 per BOE by the end of 2020, excluding gathering, processing, and transport fees. This is a major difference between Alpine High and other sweet spot Delaware Basin plays that we believe is vastly underappreciated. In addition to low costs, revenue uplift from oil and liquids in the wet gas portion of the play will contribute to strong cash margins. Together with the low F&D costs, this will drive very competitive recycle ratios compared to those generated by other Permian Basin operations. 2018 will be another key step in the transition of Alpine High from delineation and testing to full development mode. The build-out of the infrastructure backbone will continue through 2018 and into 2019. There will be times when we need to shut in production to commission new facilities, to upgrade or expand existing facilities, or to reroute product flows. The infrastructure build-out also comes with inherently unpredictable timing risks associated with weather, surface use agreements, and third-party engineering, procurement, and construction vendor delays. Drilling at Alpine High will progress at a steady and increasingly efficient pace as we transition to more pad development, while the turn-in line schedule for larger pads will periodically drive significant waves of new production capacity. Midstream installation and commissioning, in parallel with the drilling program migrating to more multi-well pads, will create significant lumpiness to the near-term production profile. As I mentioned earlier, Alpine High production in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 20,000 BOEs a day net to Apache. By 2020, average daily production is expected to be between 160,000 and 180,000 BOEs a day, which represents a compound annual growth rate in excess of 150%. Our forecast has certain embedded assumptions for improved capital efficiency and productivity that are common with new resource plays. We believe these assumptions are conservative relative to improvements the industry has seen in other unconventional plays such as the SCOOP/STACK, Utica, and Marcellus, so there is meaningful upside from this forecast. We are still very early in the unfolding of Alpine High, and there is much learning still to occur. In terms of production mix, fourth quarter 2017 volumes at Alpine High were comprised of 83% gas, 10% NGLs, and 7% oil. In our three-year outlook, we are conservatively forecasting the oil percentage to remain relatively flat, as our drilling program will be weighted toward deeper drilling for retention purposes. However, there are many avenues by which the oil mix should increase. And I anticipate we will see many updated views on the oil mix in the future. In terms of the NGL mix, our first cryogenic processing facility will be commissioned in 2019. At that point the percentage of NGLs in the production stream will begin to ramp up. And in 2020 should be around 30% of total Alpine High volumes on a BOE basis. Going forward, there are three primary program milestones to monitor. The first is well cost reductions in the development program. As we transition more of the drilling program to pads and patterns, completed well costs should improve over time and eventually land in our $4 million to $6 million target range. Second is improving well productivity in the development program. As we drill and complete more wells, you should see the learning curve benefit of more productive wells over time. And the third is expansion of the drilling inventory through the delineation and testing program. As we further test the Crest, Southern Flank, and the shallower zones of the play, we anticipate increasing the number of wet gas and oil locations significantly. Alpine High has all the makings of a great resource play. And Apache is fortunate to have such a commanding acreage position. Investing in Alpine High is arguably a gas and NGL proposition for the near-term investment horizon. We realize we are often held to the comparative conventional wisdom of Permian Basin, especially Delaware oil plays. But we believe that a hydrocarbon agnostic evaluation of this play is the right approach. Full cycle returns will be determined not only by top line revenue, but importantly, by cost structure as well. With respect to the former, we believe the macro environment is setting up very nicely for gas and NGL producers, as the important drivers like the Gulf Coast pet-chem build-out, LNG exports, and Mexican demand accelerate as we enter the next decade. In terms of costs, we are confident the geological attributes, such as continuous and contiguous transgressive sequence, high organic content, over-pressured geologic settings, and the operating simplicity that comes from low water cuts will result in Alpine High being highly competitive with, if not ultimately superior to, other leading Permian Basin plays from a full cycle return standpoint. And ultimately, that is what Apache is about, generating and sustaining leading full cycle returns. It will take time to bring clarity to the full potential of Alpine High in terms of resource and production profile. And this clarity will only come through investment. We are confident though that it will be a game changer for Apache and provide a powerful complement to the rest of our portfolio. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.
Operator: We'll pause for just a moment. The first question will come from John Herrlin with Société Générale.
John P. Herrlin - Société Générale: Yes. Thanks. Regarding your Midland well pads, John, how many wells per pad? And is the 1.5 to 2-mile length ideal? Is that your optimal horizontal length for those wells?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yeah, John. Thank you. First off, we brought on three half-section pads. And a lot of those were 8 and 10 wells, so we're testing multiple zones and the patterns there, and it's really important. I mean we'll be watching those wells now over time. We've got a couple of other – we've got a pad coming on in the first quarter, as we said, of 2018. And some others planned in 2018, which will help us with that. Right now, 1.5-to-2-mile is probably optimal. And a lot of that hinges on your land position. So we've had to do some work to kind of be able to block up some trades, to be able to drill those longer laterals. But I do think that the 1.5-to-2-mile laterals are going to be optimal for now. And obviously we're watching the spacing. I think that's one of the big keys is getting this spacing right. As you know, you can't take back wells you drill. And we've seen some instances where others have plowed ahead and are over-drilling. And now you're seeing a lot of interference. And so I think it's important to take the time, effort, collect the data, and do the science to make sure you get those patterns and spacing tests right to maximize the long-term returns.
John P. Herrlin - Société Générale: With respect to the data gathering and all that, how much incrementally or how much has that been for the well costs or the pad development costs, the technology that you're focused on?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, we had a pad where we ran fiber on all the wells. We ended up spending a couple million dollars there ultimately, because of how we collected it. We also had seismic crews out there. And we actually collected true seismic data in between each stage. So we've done a lot of things, John, where we've invested that money. But when you look at the grand scheme of things, that relative to just one well that you over-drill is money well spent. So I mean it's worth taking the time and making sure we do this right.
John P. Herrlin - Société Générale: Great. That's really it for me. Thanks.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Bob Brackett with Bernstein.
Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Question on the U.S. non-Permian, non-Alpine High. If I kind of take your guidance and back out what it implies for U.S. non-Permian, it's kind of under-investment, like a decline. If I look at the Permian outside of Alpine High, it looks like you guys basically keep it flat through 2020. Is that about right?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: When you look at the capital program with where we are today, Bob, yes. We are spending very little outside the non-Permian capital. I think you're actually going to see though, that it's – with the investment that's come off of the last three years, it's not going to decline a whole lot. In fact, our Mid-Continent stuff will actually grow with just the five wells we brought on in the SCOOP this year. So we're in a pretty good spot there. But, yes, very little capital there for 2018. Now as we get out past a couple of years and we start generating a lot of free cash flow from Alpine High, we see that changing quickly. And so we like having the optionality there in those assets. And right now in the other Permian, it's close, a little more than maintenance. But it's really more designed at going at the right pace there. As I mentioned too in the Midland Basin, I mean we've shown – if you look at the results, the back half of 2017, as I mentioned in the script, we peaked in the fourth quarter of 2015. And then we really shut the programs down, reset the cost structure. Bottomed second quarter of last year. And then quickly in a matter of two quarters made a new production high. So really it's an off/on switch. It takes a couple of quarters. But it shows you the quality and the progress that we've made in terms of being able to apply that capital to the other Permian assets.
Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And if you have those assets that other people would voraciously drill, at what point do you say that those belong in somebody else's hands? Or to your point, do you keep them for future optionality?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, we just have to weigh the value of that. I mean we look at the portfolio. We work the portfolio very hard. Last year we made a strategic decision to exit Canada, which we're very glad we did. I think one of the things that gets lost in there is that we eliminated $800 million of ARO, but that was a big strategic decision for us. We also unloaded some acreage that we felt like we got some very – prices for. And is exactly that. Something that somebody placed a high enough premium on that we felt like it would be better in their hands. So you're always looking at those things and weighing those things. And we continue to do that in the future.
Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you. [Technical Difficulty] (59:22 – 59:31)
Operator: Jeffrey, your line is open.
Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Thanks. On the multi-year plan, you mentioned the 10% service cost inflation. Can you talk through some of the other assumptions, specifically what commodity prices you're underwriting? And if you're including any expected efficiencies or productivity improvements?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: On the service side, yes. As Tim said, we have most of our big ticket items – rigs, frac crews, sand – under contract and tied up for the foreseeable future. So we feel good about the main services. But we are seeing the smaller things that drive the day to day, trucking, simple as the backhoes, pads. Everybody is wanting to raise costs everywhere. So we did bake in, in general, a 10% rise. Now when you look at some efficiencies at – and then we kind of took each play, play by play. As Tim told you, in 2017 we were able to reduce our Midland Basin well cost by 20% on a treated lateral foot basis and increase productivity by 17%. So we've taken those kind of play by play into account. The greatest efficiencies we'll see at Alpine High is we're early in that play and really starting to move into pads. And then less in the more mature plays, where we've drilled more wells. And so we've got a pretty conservative forecast on the capital side going into this year. And what I don't want to be is in a couple quarters, having to raise my capital, because I assumed that we could keep things down when the reality is there's a lot of pressure out there on a lot of different fronts.
Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: I appreciate that detail. And then I guess on the commodity price assumptions through the three-year timeframe. Just trying to get a good sense of what's under-written, when Steve talked about cash flow neutrality and the upstream piece this year, for example, and just how that might evolve over time.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah, Jeff. So obviously, there's lots of conversation out there today about cash flow neutrality and pricing assumptions and what pricing assumptions people ought to use. And obviously I think that the last few years have demonstrated how important we believe cash flow neutrality is. And we've said that many, many times that we ought to be able to live within our means. I think it's important that we actually acknowledge there are lots of different definitions out there about cash flow neutrality. There are lots of different methods that people use to talk about that. Some include dividends, some don't include dividends. Some actually go so far as to include asset sales. And some have some capital structure changes, all contributing to cash flow neutrality. Just to be clear, we take a very, maybe extremely pure approach, because we believe cash flow neutrality means that with no asset sales and with no changes to debt or equity, that you should end the year with the same amount of cash on hand that you began the year with. And that's a very pure definition. I'm not sure there's a more accurate definition of cash flow neutrality. If there is, I'd like to know what that is. So with that said, our plan for 2018 and beyond, what we talked about today around – or I talked about around 2018, is so the midstream is obviously operating at an out-spend, about a $500 million deficit. That doesn't – that's regardless of what price assumption that you might use. And there's obviously – there's some reasons that some of that might go away. And what I talked about is that the upstream, which is everything else in Apache, including dividends, that that would be cash flow neutral at current pricing is what I said, which is about $60. $60 $61, WTI's current pricing I believe, unless something's happened on the call. So we would be cash flow neutral at around that type of price assumption. We believe we could also be cash flow neutral down into the upper $50s. We're working on a number of things that could help us do that. In terms of pricing in our plan, we've actually run numerous price scenarios, all of them lower than $60. We've reviewed many of these with the board. And just a couple weeks ago, we actually agreed our plan for this year with the board, and that was at a price of $58 WTI. Obviously at that price there would be a small cash flow deficit in the upstream to go with the midstream deficit. And I think that – I think with the information that we've now provided around the plan and with the supplement around price sensitivity, around the hedge positions, we've given you lots of details. You understand cash flow sensitivity relative to movements in oil price or gas price. You see the details on our hedge positions, which obviously affect cash flow sensitivity as cash flow – as price moves down. And I think – so I think most of the data there, to meet any modeling requirements that you might have, to understand how cash flow changes as commodity prices move up or move down. The only word of warning that I would give you on that is that if you start moving too far off of this, our plan at $58 or current pricing at around $60, you start moving too far off of that either to the upside or the downside, then the current plan, all of the other elements of the plan actually begin losing relevance. Number one, we have our hedges in place, so you've got that. Number two, I think the simple math on cash flows due to price isn't really adequate. Because when you start moving well below that $58 or $60 current pricing or well above it, then all of the other assumptions inherent in the plan begin to change. All of the things around cost inflation assumptions that we've made, the actual activity set that we would engage in, the actual capital allocations that we would make, all of those change as you move far off of that plan. So we set ours at – we set the plan with the board at $58. And we think that's actually somewhat irrelevant. The current pricing, $60 to $61, we would be cash flow neutral in that upstream or everything outside of the Midland – or the midstream, which is about a $500 million deficit.
Unknown Speaker: Thank you.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah, all of that, just to be clear, again, that all includes the dividend.
Unknown Speaker: Understood. Appreciate all the color there as well. Thanks.
Operator: The next question is from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, John, to you and your whole team there.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon, Charles.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Thank you, John. I want to go back to something that you spent some time on in your prepared comments. And I'm hoping you can perhaps add a little bit more. And that's the discussion around the – said maybe the balance of returns between your Alpine High and say your Midland asset. And it sounded like you were saying in the short term, perhaps a better return is available in the Midland Basin. But if you widen the perspective a bit and look at the longer term trajectory in Alpine High, that actually that's going to deliver better returns to Apache shareholders. I wonder is that the right way to interpret your comments? And if so what is the timeframe where maybe there's a breakover that Alpine...
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, first thing is the returns in both programs are excellent, so it's really not a return difference thing, Charles. The point was we could increase short-term oil by going much quicker in the Midland Basin today or some of the other Delaware Basin stuff today. The point was in the Midland and the Delaware, we're gathering a bunch of data by moving to the pads and the pattern spacing tests. And that's really, really important data that we're collecting right now. And quite frankly, you want to – the market has gotten conditioned to thinking that early performance in IPs is a direct correlation to EURs, which is just not the case. You have to look at how these wells perform and how these pads perform over a longer time, and especially as you start to look at the inside wells and so forth. So in our Midland program, we've actually brought on three brand new half-section pads late last year, which we're going to critically watch. And they're a little different configurations and we collected a lot of data. So there are two elements there. What my point was is we could accelerate the short-term oil over the longer-term investment at Alpine High. At Alpine High, you have a totally different animal, though. You have 6,000 feet of hydrocarbon column. We've got a 70-mile fairway, 340,000 acres that we control, multiple zones. We've now proven over 11 different landing zones across just the vertical column, and there's many, many more as we work through that. So it takes time. We're moving the infrastructure forward. And most of that's geared to the wet gas infrastructure that we have to have to process that and get put in place. And so when we look at advancing that over time and then you just look at the velocity at which we'll be able to reinvest that capital because of the F&D and because of the turnover and the returns, from a longer-term perspective, what's in our best interest now is advancing the Alpine High at this pace and the Midland Basin at the pace we're at.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Okay, got it. I think that makes sense, John. And then this is more just a rifle shot question. The Dogwood and Elbert State pads, your Alpine High pads that you gave us some results on, I believe you gave us the oil cut. But what was the – if you could, give us an idea of the NGL yield on those.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: No, the Dogwood pad we said is in the dry gas. I think the thing that's very exciting about that is that's a six-well pad that's on 660-foot spacing. And quite frankly, that's a heck of a lot tighter than what our location counts would be today. So the performance there is very encouraging. And it could lead to an increase in numbers of well counts, because it's performing very, very nicely. But the Dogwood is in the dry gas. And as we mentioned, we've got six wells on. They're 660-foot spacing, and they're currently making over 75 million [cubic feet] a day, and have already made 2 Bcf in a very short term while they were cleaning up. So it's really the first true pad and pattern. And it's validating the organics. This is a true shale. And so you're seeing great response from the first pad. The Elberts are shallower. And there you see the liquid yield goes up. Those are still cleaning up as well. It's a two-well pad. I think the key there was we got the cost down. And what you're seeing there is the liquid yield. And that will be wet gas too as it moves up. So I don't know, Tim, do you have the NGL yield on the Elberts?
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: This is high BTU gas. And under the cryo, it's going to be in the 140 barrel per million range of a typical wet gas well.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: And it's about 60 barrels a million right now of oil too, correct?
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Correct.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Great, that's what I was looking for. Thanks, Tim, and thanks, John.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Charles.
Operator: The next question will come from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Thanks. I guess first on the trajectory of Alpine High in the three-year outlook, I'm just curious. Should we think about that as basically filling up infrastructure as you go, or do you have remaining infrastructure capacity to continue growth beyond that timeframe?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: No, Michael, it's a pretty conservative plan. It's really based on retention, half the capital going to retention. We will be ahead of that. I said we would end the year at about 830 million a day of inlet processing capacity at the end of this year. And the volumes we have on that outlook don't fill that up. So we've got a lot of capacity there. And quite frankly, I think there's room for the picture to improve greatly as time marches on this year, both in terms of the volumes as well as the liquid content and the oil content as we test more of the zones and go forward there.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: And in what timeframe does the Alpine High project as a whole go from being in an investment phase where there's an outspend, including the midstream, to – let's just set aside monetization, but to a free cash flow phase where you're actually harvesting the cash flows from the program?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: We look at it – probably the best way to put this to you is on a rig line basis. A single rig line is going to turn cash flow positive in less than two years. And so if we hold the rig lines constant, you'll see it turn pretty quickly. So that's how we think about it. We laid out the capital on the midstream was (1:14:04) $500 million last year. We said $500 million this year and then $250 million, $250 million. So it starts scaling down. So then it really comes down to the pace on those rig lines. But you're going to see this thing start throwing off a tremendous amount of cash in less than a two-year window per rig line.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Okay. And then last on my end is just around the cost structure. I was just looking year on year at the LOE cost guide. It's up despite adding a pretty large wedge of what I would think is pretty low-cost gas. What's going on there that's not driving a reduction in LOE per unit? And should we anticipate a reduction over the longer timeframe within the three-year outlook?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: There's no doubt that, as we mentioned in there, the per-barrel numbers are going to come down on Alpine High. Some of that's with starting to put various things in the LOE lines that hadn't been there prior. Some of it is when we pored our plan, our guys have taken a pretty conservative approach for what LOE looks like right now just because of the pressure we're getting for everywhere to raise the small things. So I think there's room, as we have historically done, to work on those numbers and beat those numbers. But it's probably just a little bit with this price environment changing so dynamically, that and the timing of some pads and some things coming on that is driving that. But there's no doubt over time the LOE per BOE for the Permian is going to come down significantly as Alpine High ramps up.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: And at the corporate level, should we see that by 2019 you think, or more time?
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yes, this is Steve. So I think that a lot of that will depend on what happens with the midstream at Alpine High. Because John made reference to what we believe the LOE per BOE at Alpine High will be in his prepared remarks. That was excluding the midstream costs. And today, all of the midstream costs show up, or the operating costs for that show up as LOE. And obviously, as you're building that out, you're building out capacity and starting it up and operating it below its actual true capacity, in some cases and for some periods of time well below its true capacity. You're going to have a pretty high cost per BOE going through that. Two things will change that, number one, just ramping it up to a larger scale and really getting it ramped up to efficient activity. But also eventually what's going to happen, or at least I would anticipate will happen, is that the midstream assets become part of a midstream enterprise separate from Apache. And depending on the accounting treatment of that, the structure of it and control and ownership, you could see all those costs move over to gathering and transportation, which will be more of a typical third-party type of transport and processing fee as opposed to LOE. But that's going to have a meaningful impact, especially on 2018, the startup and operations of that midstream enterprise.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: All right. Look forward to seeing how it all progresses. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good afternoon.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Hey, Brian.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: With the three-year outlook on Alpine High to get to 160,000 to 180,000 BOE a day, fully recognizing that production mix is different from value, can you just give us the update on your expectations for the oil versus NGLs versus gas split in 2020? And then on the gas piece, what are your expectations for how much will go beyond the local market in 2020? I think you referenced the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline as one option, but maybe you could quantify that a little bit more.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: in the prepared remarks, we said fourth quarter, you were 83% gas, 10% NGLs, and 7% oil. And we said in my prepared remarks by 2020 that the oil, we assume the oil will remain about constant. And the NGL volume's going to grow to about 30%. So you're going to be more like 63% gas, that's probably then going to be two-thirds to – or more wet gas to dry gas with a heavy 30% NGL. And then we've assumed a 7% oil mix. But I believe that's pretty conservative. And that's – as I mention right now, our plan is geared more towards retention and what we see without the ability to be able to drill more at the other locations. So that's how that'll transition. And...
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: And on the marketing side, we've got a lot of activities actually underway here, a lot of parts that we're working on. We're continuing to contract gas at or around Waha or near our assets. We're continuing to work on contracting gas down on the Gulf Coast, where we now have the capacity to transport 500 million a day starting in 2019. So we're working on marketing contracts at the Gulf Coast from that point forward. And then we're continuing to look at more gas opportunities as well as – for the longer term, as well as oil and NGLs. And so I think there's still a lot of work to do on the marketing side, both physically moving product and also selling that product or downstream products from those products.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. And then shifting to the other side of the world, there was some news earlier this week of some contracts signed to move natural gas into Egypt in a couple years out, at a price ostensibly greater than what Apache receives for its gas. I realize that Apache's price is probably a blend of a number of contracts and concessions. But how prominent are the opportunities to grow gas production on your concessions? And how interested would you be in investing or monetizing that in some other way?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: I mean there are definitely opportunities to move that forward. I mean I think we just added 40% to our acreage footprint. Most of our revenue comes from the oil side, quite frankly. And the way a lot of our concessions are structured and so forth, some of those prices are set. The Egyptian government has been very flexible and willing to step in and structure things that would encourage some development of some different types of things. So I think you'll see us continue to do that. And if it makes economic sense in relation to the oil that we're developing over there, we will do that. In general, we applaud the contracts to bring the gas in. I think it's a good thing for Egypt and the country and actually, it's very beneficial to us. So we're happy to see what's happening, both in the deepwater with the gas developments there as well as bringing in the gas that was recently announced.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Leo Mariano with MetAlliance (1:21:37).
Unknown Speaker: Yes, hey guys. Just in terms of the Alpine High midstream monetization, recognize that it sounds like you guys are still contemplating various avenues here. But just try and think of it from a high level perspective. Is this likely to be an event you think that's going to come later in 2018, or more of a 2019 event?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It could come any time in 2018 I would guess. I'll be honest with you. We made a lot of progress. We've had some inbound proposals that are fairly attractive. There's a tremendous amount of interest. And quite frankly, I think there's a lot of folks out there that realize this is going to be one of the most critical pieces of infrastructure in the Delaware Basin. And so I'm very optimistic that we'll be able to get something done and something that'll be very, very strategic for Apache.
Unknown Speaker: All right, that's very helpful. And then just looking at kind of the Alpine High project and thinking about some of the splits that you threw out there in terms of hydrocarbon mix. You certainly talked about strong rates of return for your shareholders here. Just wanted to kind of think about some sensitivities there. Have you guys looked at kind of some of the downside cases, where if say you're getting $2 for the gas over the next three years and $20 for the NGLs, does the project still have kind of the right hurdle rates for Apache?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It – the beauty of it is, is with the wet gas, you don't need the gas. Now you got a scenario where you have really low NGL prices and really – I mean obviously, as under a scenario where all commodity prices go way down, then it's a different story. But this thing's going to really hum below $2 on the gas side. And I think with what's going on on the Gulf Coast, with the expansion that's taken place in the petrochemical end, we look out to 2019, 2020, 2021, and we see a pretty robust NGL market, as well as the ability to get the gas to the Gulf Coast. So it's what sets this play apart is the cost structure. And ultimately, it's the cost to drill the wells that's going to be superior and the deliverability. And it's that combination with the liquid yields and the oil production is what makes it unique. And quite frankly that's what we know makes it differential. And the other factor is you're not going to have to move a lot of water in the lower zones. And that's another very differentiating fact. But, yes, we've run many cases on the downside. We would not be making this type of investment on the midstream or the upstream side if we thought there was a sensitivity that was close to anything that would come into making it not work under very, very low gas and NGL and oil prices.
Unknown Speaker: Thanks, guys.
Operator: The final question is from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Oh, hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for squeezing me in. John, you've given a fairly robust defense of the Alpine High in terms of the returns, the cost structure, and so on. And certainly, the production growth looks pretty impressive. Can you give us an idea of what you anticipate the cash flow growth to look like under your planning assumptions matching that? Because obviously it's going to be a function of basis differential and the prevailing gas price at that time. So what are your planning assumptions as you see going through 2020 in terms of cash flow growth?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: I think as you get out longer term and you see the expansion in the infrastructure that we see as being built and will be built, we don't see Waha continuing to trade at a big discount on down the road, because that will be solved. Part of it starts with the Kinder [Morgan] Gulf Coast Express Pipeline in 2019 and so forth. So I mean historically, Waha has traded at a, call it, $0.10 to $0.20 discount. Over the long haul, you're probably going to be in a $0.35 to $0.50 transportation cost differential at worst. You could – some scenarios actually see Waha become a premium, depending on what happens ultimately with Mexico and so forth and the West Coast. So we think, try to think, longer term with a project like this. We realize it's a little disruptive. If you look at last year when we were putting in a lot of our hedges, we were a lot of the market at Waha. And a lot of the reason why that differential is where it is today. We recognize that. So any time you bring on a world class play that's going to be a little bit disruptive, you've got to go through that time period till you can see through it. But I think as we get out to the timing, when we start to see the cash flows really ramp up here, the beauty of it is we will be solving some of the short-term obstacles that would stand in its way initially.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I appreciate the answer. My follow-up, I'm afraid, is a midstream question also. Because obviously this is a fairly pivotal event if you are able to get something done this year. Your CapEx guide assumes $500 million for midstream. And forgive me if I'm wrong. I think you had indicated you might see the same spend next year also. Are you pretty much done after that in terms of midstream build-out? And if you did manage to find a structure for the midstream, would that capital move off your balance sheet onto another entity, let's say?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yeah. Well, first of all, next year's spend, we didn't guide to $500 million. We said it would be $500 million this year and $500 million in 2019 and 2020, split evenly amongst those two years. So you're really $500 million, $250 million, $250 million is terms of how we see it. But absolutely, Doug. We envision moving the future CapEx spend into the entity, where it will be able to do its own thing. So that would be the plan. And we're very confident we're going to be able to do something. I mean it...
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Really helpful. Thanks a lot, John. Thanks, guys.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Are there any closing remarks?
Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: No, thanks, Thea. That'll conclude the call. If anybody has any questions, please call myself or Patrick Cassidy. And we'll look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thanks.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Jennifer and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark. Sir, you may begin.
Gary Clark: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's third quarter 2017 financial and operational results conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; Executive Vice President of Operations Support, Tim Sullivan; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Steve Riney. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our third quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. I will now turn the call over to John.
John Christmann: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will discuss third quarter results and accomplishments, comment on our Midland basin oil production and development program, recap some of the key Alpine High points from last month's webcast and provide an update on our 2018 planning process and current thinking around commodity price assumptions. Beginning with the third quarter, as anticipated, our average daily net production in the US returned to a growth trajectory. We also grew net production in the North Sea and gross production in Egypt. Production was in line with our guidance with notably strong performance in Permian oil volumes. We stated in our webcast update last month that we expect this performance to carry through into the fourth quarter with Midland and Delaware oil production tracking at the high end of the guidance range, established back in February. As we also noted, the delayed start-up of two central processing facilities at Alpine High caused by Hurricane Harvey will defer some natural gas volumes into 2018. So, our updated fourth quarter production guidance is unchanged. In the Midland and Delaware basins, we are benefiting today from the strategic testing, optimization and development planning initiatives that we implemented in 2015 and 2016, while running a very lean capital program. Going forward, we anticipate continued capital efficiency gains in both the Midland and Delaware basins. This is particularly true at Alpine High, as we move further into multi-well pad development, continue to extend average lateral length, utilize more smart completions and further optimize our landing zone targeting and well spacing. The majority of optimization benefits, which have been proven in other unconventional plays are still ahead of us at Alpine High. On the international side, cash flow generation during the third quarter was strong once again, as both Egypt and the North Sea benefited from improving Brent crude prices and production from our Callater startup in the North Sea. Overall, capital investment was in line with expectations and remains on track with our guidance for the full year. We have shifted some capital in the back half of 2017 from our international regions into the US to take advantage of attractive portfolio opportunities in the Permian Basin. Finally, we continue to benefit from our cost structure focus with both LOE per BOE and G&A costs remaining low as a result of the significant rationalization efforts over the last two years. Apache also made some excellent progress this quarter with regard to its portfolio transition. Specifically, the discovery of Alpine High enabled our strategic exit from Canada. In only one short year, we will have completely replaced our Canadian production and we will have done so with an asset that offers significant returns and is only just beginning to show its enormous long term potential. Value creation and returns accretion were challenged in Canada, given this low ratio of cash margins to F&D cost. Alpine High on the other hand will have significantly lower F&D costs, much more attractive cash margins and will transform Apache's long term return on capital employed profile. Organic portfolio transformations like this take time, but are much more accretive to returns than acquiring high priced proved acreage positions. I will now turn to the Midland Basin where activity is primarily focused on multi-well pad drilling to the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations. Our third quarter oil production was up approximately 5,500 barrels per day over the second quarter, as we are delivering excellent results from recent multi-well pads in our core areas. We will continue to progress our development efforts with two more pads coming online before year end. Our focus in the Midland basin is on multi-well pads and full field development. We believe the proper approach to an unconventional resource has developed each section in a way that optimizes long term value and returns. This requires a full understanding of intra-well dynamics and proper spacing in order to design development patterns that optimize costs and recovery. Additionally, Apache utilizes a fully burdened returns approach, which should give you confidence that the anticipated returns will result in a competitive return on capital employed at the corporate level. Tim will share more details on the impressive progress we have made in our Midland basin development efforts. Next I would like to move to Alpine High and reiterate a few of the key points made in last month's webcast. First, Alpine High consists of three primary plays, a highly economic wet gas play that contains the majority of our currently identified locations, a dry gas play that is smaller, but very economic and an emerging oil play with tremendous future potential. Second, we increased our location count from 3000 to more than 5000, which consists of at least 3500 locations in the wet gas play, at least 1000 locations in the dry gas play and more than 500 locations in the oil play. As we have previously discussed, we believe there is significant upside potential to all of these location counts. Third, 90% of our currently disclosed locations are in the highly predictable and repeatable transgressive source interval, which consists of the Woodford, Barnett and Penn formations. Being a true source interval, there is minimal in situ water that will be produced with the hydrocarbons. Water handling and disposal costs are becoming a significant challenge across the Delaware Basin and this will only get more difficult in the future. We are fortunate to not have this problem in the transgressive source interval. Fourth, returns of Alpine High are driven by the combination of extremely low development costs with attractive cash margins. Recent wells have validated our assumptions on future drilling and completion costs. Cash margins will be attractive due to the high quality liquid content and the low operating costs. Lastly, we are very pleased with the performance of the wells of Alpine High, many of which have been producing now for several months. Cumulative production data is confirming our expectations for this high quality rock, which was predicated on extensive geologic, geophysical and reservoir engineering work. Our investment economics are robust for all three plays at current or lower commodity prices and are consistent with those presented more than a year ago. Next, I'd like to discuss the process we are undertaking as we finalize our 2018 plans. Since the beginning of 2015, we have operated Apache with a fundamental belief that over a typical run of years, it is both possible and appropriate for an E&P company to live within operating cash flows. Within cash flow, a company should be capable of growing production volumes and delivering competitive rates of return above its cost of capital, while also increasing return of capital to shareholders through dividends and/or share buybacks. We have taken a number of transformative steps over the last three years, designed to enable this vision, irrespective of the oil and gas price environment. We streamlined our portfolio and strategically shifted our asset base, reset our overhead and operating cost structure, dramatically reduced our capital investment program from mid-2015 through 2016 to live within cash flow, implemented a rigorous capital allocation process based on fully burdened returns as opposed to fundamentally flawed half cycle economics and reduced debt and preserved our dividend without issuing equity and diluting our shareholders' future ownership. Recently, we have been on the road meeting with shareholders and other long term oriented potential investors. Encouragingly, the market sentiment is becoming more aligned with Apache's philosophy. For most of the last three years, the E&P industry has been engaged in excess spending to drive short term oil growth. Today, we are seeing a return to the fundamentals of capital discipline and focus on long term returns. We welcome this change and believe it is very constructive for the long term health of our industry. So as Apache enters the 2018 planning season, we are experiencing some natural, but very positive short term budget tension. That is, do we continue investing in our attractive Permian upstream opportunities at what we consider to be the optimal pace for delivering the long term returns or do we pare back and manage the program for cash flow neutrality. That is a nice problem to have and as an expected outcome of discovering and bringing into development a large low cost new play. We believe Alpine High is a compelling world-class resource. Once ramped to its production potential, Apache will benefit for decades from high returns and free cash flow from a significant portion of our future capital employed. Given the dynamic nature of our opportunity set and the volatile commodity price environment, our 2018 capital budget is still being rigorously worked. Consistent with previous years, we will issue our 2018 budget and associated guidance in conjunction with our fourth quarter earnings results in February. As we have in each of the past three years, we will base our 2018 plan on benchmark pricing that is slightly on the conservative side of the prevailing strip. Given the recent volatility in oil prices, this means we are preparing for a number of possible scenarios. Fortunately, we have considerable portfolio flexibility. Our focus now is prioritizing next year's activity and identifying areas where the capital program could be pared back. While spending could be lower in 2019, the allocation of capital across the portfolio would likely be very similar to 2017 with Permian Basin investment representing the majority of Apache's capital program. Internationally, we will continue to invest to maintain current levels of free cash flow. At recent oil and gas prices, this spend is in the $700 million to $900 million range. In 2018, we will also continue to fund the Alpine High midstream buildout as this is strategically important to enable an optimized upstream development program. As we have stated previously, we believe this represents a very attractive investment opportunity and are continuing to review its monetization potential. Finally, like in 2017, we have begun a program of hedging for 2018 and '19. This activity is focused on protecting cash flows to support our near term capital program. Steve will talk more about the details in his prepared remarks. To sum up, the third quarter was important for Apache as it marked our strategic exit from Canada, the very early stage acceleration of production at Alpine High and a significant turn in our Permian Basin oil production. We're making excellent progress across the company. As the Permian region grows in relative scale with our portfolio, the quality of its returns and cash flows will improve those of Apache as a whole. Our teams have created a deep inventory of investment opportunities, both domestically and internationally. As we have over the past three years, we will fund these opportunities in a disciplined manner that in no way stresses our balance sheet. We look forward to discussing our plan further in February when we will provide a review of our operating cash flow, capital spending and production outlook for 2018, a higher level preliminary outlook for 2019 and potentially beyond, a longer term view into how the investments we're making today will improve long term corporate level returns and free cash flow and a more detailed view into Alpine High for both the upstream and the midstream. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Tim who will provide some operational highlights.
Tim Sullivan: Good afternoon. My remarks today will cover operational activity and key wells in our US and international focus areas and their impact as we plan for 2018 and subsequent years. Our third quarter production results reflect the ramp up in drilling activity Apache began at the end of last year. We have shifted to a growth trajectory and are benefiting from the fiscal discipline and returns focused drilling programs that we initiated in 2015. During the third quarter, we maintained activity at a measured pace, averaging 36 operated rigs worldwide with 17 in the Permian, 4 in other North American areas, 12 in Egypt and 3 in the North Sea. In North America, third quarter 2017 adjusted production average 207,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 7% from the second quarter. Please note these volumes exclude Canada, where we completed our country exit during the period. With the success of our Midland basin drilling program and the continued production ramp at Alpine High, third quarter oil production increased 8% quarter to quarter. Our core Midland Basin assets are the primary contributor to these higher oil volumes. At our Wildfire field in Midland County, we completed seven wells with mile and a half laterals at the June tippet-12/13 pad. The pad comprises four completions in the lower Spraberry with twelve by spacing and three completions in the Wolfcamp B on six by spacing. These wells achieved an average 30-day peak initial production rate of 1058 BOE and fifty per day, producing 83% oil. Also in the Wildfire field, on the Lynch A unit, we drilled a six well lower Spraberry pad, also with 12 by spacing. The wells were drilled with a mile and a half long laterals and average a 30-day peak IP rate of 1142 BOE per day, producing 85% oil. At the Powell field in Upton County, we drilled the CC4045, a six well pad with two mile laterals on 12 by spacing staggered in the Wolfcamp B1 and B3 formations. These wells have been online for about four weeks and are trending toward an average 30-day peak IP rate of 1300 BOE per day with 80% oil. We plan to drill three additional wells on this pad in early 2018. These excellent Midland Basin well results are reflective of our integrated approach to determine optimal landing zones, pattern spacing, lateral length and completion design. At Alpine High, net sales to Apache averaged 13300 BOE per day during the third quarter. As we noted in our webcast last month, we began our fourth quarter, producing at a rate of 20,300 BOE per day and assuming this start-up of the Hidalgo CPF by the end of the year, we anticipate achieving production of approximately 25,000 BOE per day. We continue to make good progress on drilling, completion and cost optimization at Alpine High. We recently drilled and completed three wells with an average lateral length of approximately 4500 feet and for an average cost of $5.5 million. We remain very confident that in our development, we will be able to achieve completed well costs in the range of $4 million to $6 million, which is consistent with the economics we put forward when we announced the play last year. I'll turn now to our international assets. Gross production in Egypt increased slightly to 339,000 BOE per day. Adjusted production in Egypt which excludes minority interest and the impact of tax barrels decreased slightly from the second quarter 2017 to 87,000 BOE per day. The decrease in adjusted production reflects the terms of our production sharing contracts in Egypt, which generally provide for fewer cost recovery barrels to the contractor as the price of Brent index crude oil increases. In the North Sea, production increased 9% from the second quarter to 60,000 BOE per day. Net production from the Callater field is currently averaging approximately 14,000 BOE per day from two wells. A third well, the CB1, was recently drilled into a new fault block and found more than 260 foot of net pay. This well is expected to come online later this month. Please see our financial and operational supplement posted today for more information on drilling and production activity during the third quarter in our US and international regions. I'll now turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Riney: Thank you, Tim and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I will begin with a brief review of our third quarter financial results, comment on our infrastructure build out and future midstream plans at Alpine High, provide some additional color on certain Alpine High economic assumptions behind our webcast last month and lastly I will update our hedge positions and the continuing strength of our financial position. Let me begin with third quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, Apache reported net income of $63 million or $0.16 per diluted common share. Results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates. The after tax values of some of the more material items are a $219 million gain related to recent divestitures, $104 million of unproved acreage impairments and a $54 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on our commodity price derivative positions. Excluding these and other similar items, our adjusted earnings for the quarter was $14 million or $0.04 per share. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $554 million. Before working capital changes, Apache generated $655 million in operating cash flow. During the third quarter, we completed non-core asset sales in the US and Canada for net cash proceeds of $693 million. Our cash position on September 30, including a small amount of restricted cash, was $1.9 billion, up from $1.7 billion the previous quarter. Lease operating expenses in the third quarter were $8.74 per barrel of oil equivalent, down slightly from the prior quarter. Our year to date LOE was $8.42 per barrel of oil equivalent, which is in line with our guidance for the full year of $8.25 to $8.75 per BOE. Exploration expense in the third quarter was $231 million. $198 million of this was attributable to dry hole expense and unproved leasehold impairments. The primary contributors to dry hole expense this quarter were the previously mentioned well in the barrel area of the North Sea along with some exploration wells in Egypt. Unproved impairment costs were primarily related to acreage in the Anadarko Basin. These were legacy acreage positions, which based on the success of Alpine High will clearly never compete for further exploration funding. Our October 9 webcast included a review of the progress we have made on our Alpine High midstream buildout. As John mentioned, we are investing in a large infrastructure system that will make for an extremely attractive midstream enterprise. Our board recently approved plans to install a first phase of cryogenic processing in Alpine High. This decision was taken for three primary reasons. Most importantly, we believe the incremental cost of cryo processing will be economic in the future. Secondly, having at least some cryo capacity significantly enhances the reliability of processing the extremely rich gas to assure we meet sales pipeline spec and finally cryo processing capacity will enhance the value of the midstream enterprise and product marketing by introducing optionality for the product stream. We will begin by installing 200 million cubic feet per day of cryo capacity, which will come online in 2019. Future increments of additional capacity will be treated as independent decisions and will have to be economically justified based on the then prevailing price outlook for gas and NGLs. To eliminate any potential confusion, let me be clear that this investment is already embedded in our current $500 million Alpine High Midstream capital plans for 2018. Note also that this Midstream spend may be pared back when we finalize our 2018 budget. Next, I would like to discuss some questions that have come up related to the economic assumptions for Alpine High that were set forth in last month's webcast. One of these questions is about how we arrived at our estimated average NGL realization of 60% of WTI. To begin with, I should clarify that this realization is before third-party transportation and fractionation costs. As such, you need to subtract these costs to arrive at a net realization to Apache at the least. Given we are currently trucking NGLs from our processing facilities, these costs are around $10 per barrel. In the future, with full pipe transport, these costs will be closer to $7 per barrel. At current Mont Belvieu pricing and assuming cryo recovery, over 90% of anticipated Alpine High NGL barrels would be priced in a range from 55% to 60% of WTI. Based on some of our future pricing assumptions, average NGL realizations could be as high as 70% of WTI. I would also note that the mechanical refrigeration units we currently use for processing leave most of the ethane in the gas stream. As a result, our NGL barrels today are receiving close to 75% of WTI before transportation and fractionation. Another question we have received is around our long term Waha basis differential assumption of $0.35 per million BTUs. Waha basis has ranged from a $0.37 to $0.53 discount to Henry Hub in the last six months. Prior to that, from 2010 through 2016, that same Waha basis differential range from a $0.69 discount to a $0.42 premium and averaged around $0.15 discount. The forward market view on Waha basis reflects a significant widening of the differential as anticipated production volumes would test takeaway capacity. We see this as a relatively short term risk before additional transport capacity comes online, most likely in 2019. For the long term, we believe Waha basis will trade in a lower range. Moving now to hedging, we have added some crude oil and natural gas hedges through a mix of financial derivative instruments. As a reminder, the primary goal of our hedging activity is to protect the pace of a strategically important capital program at Alpine High against the risks associated with price sensitivity on cash flows. This continues to be the case as we look to 2018. We do not use hedging to speculate on price. For 2018, we have currently hedged an average of 55,000 barrels per day in aggregate of WTI and Brent based oil production volumes through a variety of instruments. On the gas side, we have entered into a series of swap transactions that lock in average 2018 pricing at $3.07 per million BTUs for average volumes of 237 million BTUs per day. We have also entered into hedge positions relative to Waha basis. Most of these hedges are focused on production for the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019. For this four quarter time period, through a series of swap transactions, we have locked in an average basis differential of a $0.52 discount for 207 million BTUs per day of production. We also have some contractual hedges for Waha basis, which access non Waha based pricing through transportation and sales contracts. A couple of things to note. First, the actual volumes and pricing of product hedged differs from quarter to quarter. What I gave you were averages for the time periods described. Second, our hedge positions represent only a portion of our anticipated production for any given quarter. They should not be construed to give any guidance as to future production volumes. The details on all of our current hedge positions for the remainder of 2017 and the full years 2018 and 2019 can be seen in our financial and operational supplement posted on our website today with the quarterly earnings press release. I would like to conclude by emphasizing Apache's financial strength and quarter end cash position of nearly $1.9 billion. This is a product of our disciplined approach over the last few years. Looking ahead, we are well prepared for continued volatility in commodity prices. Our hedge positions provide cash flow support to assure the deployment of high priority investments without putting the balance sheet at risk. We also have the ability to flex the capital program if that proves to be the best decision for our shareholders. With regard to our capital investment plans, we are carefully weighing the balance between achieving cash flow neutrality and the desire to move forward with investments in 2018 that will optimize long term returns from our asset base. Throughout this effort, we focus on investments that will deliver full cycle economics at current or even lower commodity prices. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our fresh question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein.
Bob Brackett: A question on the US rig program. It looks like you've got four rigs running outside the Permian. Can you talk about what they're doing and would you expect those rigs to be running next year.
Tim Sullivan: Good afternoon, Bob. No, we've got one section in the scoop, where we've had three rigs running there. There are seven wells we're drilling. They will finish up year end and then they will - that's where they'll stop for now. And then in the Panhandle, we've got some acreage that we got two rigs in quickly that are going to get in and drill some footage before year end, the whole block of acreage there. So they're just purely picking up some acreage retention.
Bob Brackett: And can you think about next year? I know you don't want to give a specific guidance. Can you just give us some idea of where the levers are? What assets have the most flexibility to dial up CapEx or dial down CapEx?
Tim Sullivan: I mean if you look at the program, we're in really good shape. I mean we've given you the kind of the range. International is going to be pretty similar in the 700 to 900 range. That's where we can sustain our ability to generate good strong free cash flow there. You look at the rest of the rigs predominantly, we're sitting in the Permian with both our Midland basin and Alpine High and we will have the flexibility to flex there either directions. So we've got a lot of flexibility and you'd see it kind of generally across the Permian.
Bob Brackett: So I guess Alpine High where there are still optionality around retaining acreage might be the least flexible, but everything else has the ability to dial up and down?
Tim Sullivan: Well, even in Alpine High, we've got good flexibility in there. We don't need - we've got six rigs running there today. We would not need all six of those. I mean the nice thing about Alpine High is a lot of that land and we've got some very astute royalty owners with some very large ranches and they recognize that the best way to maximize value for them and us is alignment on how you would handle that. So it's not like we've got a section by section program, where we've got to go out and drill one well across the whole portfolio. So, we've got a lot of flexibility and that count can be scaled up or down pretty easily as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale.
John Herrlin: Two for me. With the Midland drilling, you were doing 6 to 7 well pads, is that going to be kind of the norm going forward and then the next one for me is on hedging. What's the maximum amount that you will set volumetrically Steve?
John Christmann: So on the pads, John, as you know we've been pretty vocal that you need to be developing all your areas on a section basis. So these have been designed and we've got a couple more pads coming on between now and the end of year. They've been doing our adequate spacing and pattern tests. So that's why there are no half sections, we're kind of doing a half section test pad. So that's what you've had going on in the Midland and it's really defined tune exactly the pattern and the spacing between the various landing zones that we say. Hedging, I'll let Steve.
Steve Riney: John, the question on hedging was what's the maximum volume we would hedge?
John Herrlin: Yeah.
Steve Riney: So we don't - we haven't really thought about what the maximum volume at this point in time. We've hedged - we've begun the hedging process. So I think you got to go back to first of all what's the purpose of hedging and why do we do it. We generally like commodity price exposure that's the business that we're in and we prefer to have it. We hedge for purposes of protecting the capital program against say a low price environment. We began hedging oil and gas for 2018 during the quarter. And we put the positions on that you see in the supplement. We feel like that's a good place to be right now. We feel like the oil price movement has been pretty constructive here recently and we'll continue just to monitor that and align any forward hedging program or activity. With that strategy, we want to make sure that we're protecting the balance sheet and cash flows associated with the capital program that we want to deliver.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.
Paul Sankey: Can I just follow up on the hedging question while we're on it and you explained that some of the force behind it. But you also have repeatedly made the point that you've been relatively cautious over the down cycle and you're going to remain I think, it sounded, let's say, cautious relative to the strip going forward. Isn't that a bit of a belt and braces guys in terms of planning the company just in terms of being both cautious on how you plan and hedged.
Steve Riney: Yeah, maybe so Paul. I don't know, I've never worn belts and braces. I don't think that that's necessarily a bad thing in the price environment that we've come out of over the last couple of years in the volatility associated with it. To be a little bit cautious, a little bit conservative about what we're committing to in the capital program and the liquidity and financial capability of meeting those commitments once we've made them. [indiscernible] maybe a bit on the conservative side on doing that, yes. We've indicated the volumes that we've had for the quarters out in 2018 and Waha basis hedges for '19 as well. We haven't gotten into what is that relative to anticipated production volume. The only thing I would say is that we are below 50% of our anticipated production volume in almost every product, in almost every quarter for 2018 and definitely 2019 obviously, we don't have any commodity hedges other than the Waha basis. So we've still got a significant amount of unhedged volumes going into 2018.
John Christmann: And one thing I want to add to Paul is, we've done some things to protect the upside to because we like the exposure even on the oil where we've done some collars, we've also bought the coal as well. So it's more geared towards protecting some downside and protecting the balance sheet over the short term than it is trying to make a price collar because we like actually the constructive nature, especially on the oil side.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.
Jeoffrey Lambujon: If the planned midstream monetization is structured, it comes with a large cash payment up front or if commodity prices are materially higher than what you end up budgeting with for next year. Can you just talk through how you'd rank your options for allocating that extra discretionary funding?
John Christmann: The good news is, is with the price movements has gotten very constructive lately. And we find ourselves and can see a price now where we could actually have some free cash flow next year pretty soon. So I mean that puts you in a position to, you know, we've been a company that's maintained our dividend and actually continued to return something to the shareholders over the last three years. So obviously dividend is an option if you look at in terms of - you could be in a position of accretion. Obviously share buybacks or some acceleration, but clearly we would look to find ways to return that to shareholders.
Jeoffrey Lambujon: And then just one last one, looking longer term, starting with the cash balance that you're planning to exit this year with, obviously gives you a lot of flexibility in the near-term to do - to explore some of those options you've mentioned. What does that number look like long terms, is there a steady-state cash balance you have in mind. Thanks.
Steve Riney: I think the steady-state cash balances obviously quite a bit lower than $1.9 billion. We don't anticipate carrying 1.9 billion for obviously for the extended period of time into the future. We do that now because we've got for several reasons. The two most important would be, we've got some debt maturities coming up in 2018 and we want to make sure that we've got the liquidity to handle those as they come due 560 million of debt maturing next year. And then also just having that backstop of cash and liquidity in the event of downside price volatility. We are still exposed to that and we want to make sure that we've got the liquidity to protect ourselves in the event that that occurs. I think as we get Alpine High in particular, so we get to a midstream solution in Alpine High and as we get to Alpine High becoming a larger scale producing asset and is more cash flow generative and supports itself and certainly we don't need 1.9 billion of cash I would say that would be - at a sustained level of cash is certainly below $0.5 billion.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital.
Scott Hanold: In the Anadarko Basin, you talked about having a few rigs drilling. Is that HBP, some acreage or are you testing a specific concept. And also with the write-off in that area how does that regionally, how does that write-off compare with some of the stuff you're testing right now.
John Christmann: Number one, the write-off is really legacy Anadarko Basin; it's not what we call a SCOOP stack area. So it's going to be more in the Texas panhandle, there's some hangover from the Cordillera transaction many, many years ago. So it's really more just legacy Anadarko Basin acreage have some attractive things in the future, but it's not anything we're funding or planning to fund in the near term. So that's where that is. And in the SCOOP stack, actually it's in the SCOOP area. We've got a section there that we needed to drill a well to hold, but rather than going in and drilling one well, we got in there and did seven wells because that's a proper way to do that. So we're drilling those seven wells in the in the SCOOP there to meet some lease obligations on a section that we really like. And it gives us the ability to test some spacing and things in the SCOOP as well. So kind of two birds with one stone.
Scott Hanold: And just to clarify and I know you guys are still working the capital budget for '18. Are you comfortable spending a little bit in '18 to keep Alpine High up and running or have those thoughts changed at all.
John Christmann: I mean I would say at this point we're looking at '18 hard. We're watching the commodity price view. We said we will come out with a plan that's kind of predicated on something slightly conservative to strip. So we're watching that very carefully. I think the good news is there's flexibility. I mean we don't have to outspend to keep Alpine High up and running so to say is the way you phrased it. But we're also looking at what we think is the right thing to do in the right pace to develop Alpine High. That we're just going to really maximize long-term returns and that's really what we're trying to accomplish.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer: A little bit of a similar take to Scott's last question, I think you posted the industry history about spending in recent years pretty well in the - this asset is the one worth outspending cash flow for a dilemma that you're facing is likely when many companies have faced over the years. To the degree do you decide to out of free cash neutrality? How do you prioritize between Permian and Alpine High, it seems like based on your comments you might flow the Permian. And is there any flexibility internationally or do those assets run in maintenance levels regardless.
John Christmann: Well, it's a little bit of flexibility on the international side, but we kind of laid out that range where we'd like to stay the $700,000 to $900,000. I think there's flexibility in both places. And I'd also remind you that Alpine High is part of Permian. But there's flexibility in both. I mean you wouldn't see us flex one or the other and we're not talking a massive change from what we've laid out in February of this year anyways. That plan was going to be neutral on the upstream spend at a $55 deck and we're not far from that right now. So we're not talking about a lot that we'd have to pare back and it can be flexed into place. And so we'd look at what we thought made the most sense. And that's some of the exercises and scenarios we're running through right now.
Brian Singer: And then on Alpine High, can you talk to a little bit more towards the oil zone opportunities and whether you see a scenario or a likely scenario where you see less volatility and greater predictability of well performance from those zones or should we expect the well may ultimately be perspective and may not necessarily be as consistent.
John Christmann: Well, I mean I think it's just different geology. I mean that's something we've gone to great lengths to explain in terms of a source interval versus a parasequence, which is what the Wolfcamp and the Bone Springs are in the Delaware Basin. So actually if you look at the five wells we've drilled, we're very pleased with the results. Since the disclosure on October 9, we've actually had another one well in there that's cleaned up very, very nicely. So it's actually fairly predictable. We're just talking in terms of the geology. You have to get in and do your rigorous mapping. We have to do the inversion work with the seismic. I mean it's more going to be based on where the organics inside and what's really water wet rock and you have to do the detail work. But once you've done the detail work, it's going to be pretty predictable. It's just not a blanket you're going to lay across a large area. Most of the locations you know we'd came out with 500 was based on a couple of landing zones, we've in truthfulness we've added another one, so those location counts are going to go up even since the October 9 disclosure. So we see it as a very prominent program. I can tell you most of those are in the northern trough. And the good news is, with every well we drill in Alpine High, we're looking at all those sections. So we see it as a very viable and a very material play that we're going to continue to move forward. And you're going to see the number of landing zones and the location counts grow.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Morris with Citi.
Bob Morris: John, you did a nice job last month of laying out the liquids and oil potential an Alpine High. And you sort of touched on this earlier in the Q&A. But you'd been working to try and renegotiate or extend a lot of your leases to be able to accelerate drilling of the shallower zones and still hold those without having to drill to the deeper gassier zones first. How is that progressing? And then, second part of that question is, is there a minimum level of activity or capital spend in 2018 to hold the acreage that you have now that you'd be able to or would want to have to maintain?
John Christmann: There's two things I would say, Bob. Number one, we do have some very sophisticated land owners and we've been making great progress on our discussions with them as well. But it's not a matter of just trying to drill the shallow zones and not drill the deeper zones later. What you really want to do like anything is, you wanted to develop the sections properly and very systematically where we would develop the deeper zones and the shallow zones together where we need to do that. What you don't want to do is come back later and drill deeper after you have develop shallower or you're going to find yourself with some of the challenges that you're seeing in the other parts of the Permian. Where now they happen to run extra casing strings and things to deal with water flows because you've they're going to run extrication strange things to deal with water flows because you've because you've dealt in depletion and that sort of thing. So contrary to that one of the advantages we have at Alpine High, we've done a lot of data analytics and been recently able to eliminate even a string of seven of 58s on our 14,000 foot TVD wells. So you want to do this properly and I think the conversations we're having with the landowners are constructive and that you want to go about this in the right way where we can develop the wet gas and the oil zones and you want to do them where you don't have to go back in later. So it's more or less of you know developing everything and then margin directionally than it is trying to develop bottom up or come in and develop all your shallow and then have to drill through your shallow to get your deep.
Bob Morris: That made sense, so that would seem instill a little more activity in drilling these wells. So the second part of my question was, in doing all of that, is there a minimum level of activity or capital spend you need to do in 2018 to be able to hold onto leases?
John Christmann: If you look at '18 and I look at Alpine High and if I just if - even if we were to keep a six rig program, less than half of that would be necessary in terms of near term acreage. So I mean, we're in a really good spot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson with KLR Group.
Gail Nicholson: Looking at the replacement of the Canadian volumes in the year with the Alpine production. That's very impressive especially since now those wells are completed in the optimal manner. When you look at the well count to get to that $50,000 rate by next May, what percentage was optimally completed and what percentage was more science wells?
John Christmann: I mean if you look today, I mean we've been making that shift. And as of the October 9 disclosure we had 34 wells online. And we said we're going to be virtually halfway there year end with I think another eight wells, we're going to bring on 42 by year end. So as we move forward and start to shift into our pattern and spacing tests, you're going to continue to see us start to climb that curve. I'll give you a little bit of a feel for well camps that are necessary to do that.
Gail Nicholson: And then just shifting tack a little bit, I know everyone is trying to talk about cash neutrality and paring back the budget. But looking at the improvement in kind of Brent/LLS pricing that we've seen to-date. Are there any exploratory projects in the portfolio that look more attractive that you might be willing to spend some capital on next year because of the spread there versus WTI?
John Christmann: I think we're continuing looking at the portfolio and clearly we've got projects in Egypt and the North Sea that have, you know, that are Brent-weighted. We've got some brand new acreage that in Egypt that we just received through the award process. We're anxious to get our seismic shot and we'll actually be drilling wells there. So I think it's more a function of the opportunities as we high grading things, there will be things that we will move up in the portfolio for sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles Meade: I wondered if I could push a little bit more on this idea that you put out on your prepared remarks about the optimal investment profile being a little - optimal investment for 2018 being over what you'd look at, if you just fund it with cash flow. I think most of us are understanding that to certainly applied to Alpine High, but I'm curious does that also apply to your Midland program or in other words would you, is the optimal development there, would that call for more than cash flow as well.
John Christmann: I think the thing you got to think about is, number one, we're not far off of that optimal from where we sit today anyway. So and kind of what we laid out at the start of this year would have been what we thought was optimal. So we're not, you know, we're pretty darn close to being that zip code as we sit today. The point is, you always want to balance and what's going to maximize our long-term returns and the pace. And I think the beauty of it is, as it has been alluded to we've got some flexibility, we've got some cash on the balance sheet. You're just trying to balance the right approach. And the good news is, we've got the ability to defer. So those are just some of the trade-offs that you have to balance and that's some of that what I'll call good positive tension. As you find things and discover things, your goal is to always bring more things into the portfolio that give you opportunities to high grade and pull things forward. And so it's just a good healthy situation and tells you the quality of our portfolio. And the other piece I'll say to that is. you see we're in multi-well pads, we're not out one well here, one well there. And so I think the testing we've been doing in the Midland Basic, we've been building a lot of momentum there. The patterns and spacing tests and things were also moving toward Alpine High. Those are all building towards understanding and to finding that optimal pace because that's how you're going to maximize your long-term returns versus short-term things you can do to manage short term.
Charles Meade: And actually kind of segues to what my next question is, is around what sort of results are we going to see from Midland. If we look at those three pads, where you had those good results, I believe it was [indiscernible] wells on each of those. Is that going to be the bulk of the Midland program in 2018, those big pads or at least moderate sized pads?
John Christmann: Well these are half section type tests. And so, depending on the capital level that we decide to disband, you're going to see us moving more into full section development type mode. And you'll see more similar type things, but that will be hinged on the pace that we want to go. And the beauty of having a lot of inventory that's drill ready and the infrastructure that we put in place puts you in a great position to be able to move forward. But you'll see continued building on pad level type economics because fundamentally we think that's how you're going to create the most value
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with J.P. Morgan.
Arun Jayaram: I want to start off, you mentioned in your script how you'd moved some capital from international back to the US. I'm wondering if you could talk about that as well as the prospects for the North Sea and maybe just highlight the results thus far Callater.
John Christmann: I mean, I'd let Tim go into details on Callater, but first two wells that gone on are performing quite well. Any color you want to add Tim to Callater.
Tim Sullivan: The first two wells we brought on, net production was about 19,500 barrels of oil per day. They're currently producing about 13,000 barrels per day right now. We've got another well that will be bringing on shortly. We do have some facility constraints there with our bundle and some surface facilities. But we also have future drilling plans out at Callater as well. So a lot of good things happening there in the North Sea.
John Christmann: And I would say on the capital shift, Arun, it's pretty minor. But it's more geared towards some of the pad testing and things we're doing in the Midland basin.
Arun Jayaram: And just a question, as you guys think about future markets for Alpine High gas. Is obviously the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline, which is the Kinder Pipeline, any thoughts on Apache participating in that long haul pipe?
John Christmann: We're looking at all options. I mean our gas today is flowing into Mexico, but we're certainly not counting on the Mexican market to be the purchaser of all of our gas. We recognize that we've got to be able to move a substantial volume of gas to the Gulf Coast. We're certainly looking at all options associated with that. And for that matter the liquids as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Doug Leggate: John, just come back to the relative capital allocation for next year, what's the obligation on from an HBP standpoint in Alpine High that might limit your flexibility there. And what I'm really getting at is that you've obviously got a very strong ratable program in the Midland. I'm just wondering would you tend to skew capital away from the Midland in order to meet HBP or would you want to keep the momentum going in the Midland as well. I've got a follow up please.
John Christmann: No, I mean, I think as I've answered, we're in a good place in both. I think we'll be able to move both programs forward. if you look at current rig count today as I mentioned less than half of the capital we'll be spending this year as we kind of roll forward into next year would be required in terms of how we need to meet lease obligations in the Alpine High. So I think we're in a pretty good zone that we can materially move both programs forward, like we need to move them forward.
Doug Leggate: Is five-rig program is still the right number for avoiding any acreage expiry and so on?
John Christmann: I mean if we look at Alpine High today, I mean, you could see something similar very easily.
Doug Leggate: My follow actually is really going back to the question about the activity level outside of the Permian. I mean, when you look at the returns that you're talking about in the Alpine High, their obviously, they're going to just be anything else in the portfolio it seem so. When you think about the scaling up of that business going forward, what does it say about the high grading of the bonds? I know you've done a lot, but is there more to be done thinking obviously Oklahoma in particular.
John Christmann: Well, I mean I think the key there is, number one, I mean if you look at the portfolio today, we like the balance that we have across the entire portfolio. We like what we have internationally or like what Egypt and the North Sea bringing to the table with exposure to Brent, we think we've got world class operations there and we differentiate ourselves. And so we like having free cash flow that we can invest. We also like the running room and the exposure we have in those two areas. I think it's a very good compliment. When we look at North America, we're always looking at the portfolio and that's something we will continue to do and continue to do on a daily basis. I like right now we moved up and we've got a nice position in the SCOOP. We could run a couple of rig program up there for several years. And we think it competes fairly nicely. So that's where your rigs are now. But I'll tell you we continue to look at the portfolio, we continue to have those conversations with the board. And I think the nice thing is, with the, you know, those areas there's a lot of upside and there's very little to hold those positions. And so I think they really create options for us in the future because we can see to a point where we're going to be generating a lot of free cash flow coming out of Alpine High.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.
Michael Hall: I guess maybe just continuing on the theme around cash flow neutrality and balance. Two questions I guess, number one, longer-dated, how far out do you see it when Alpine High does become self-sustaining including any midstream spend. And then secondarily, when we talk about cash flow neutrality, just to be clear, is that CapEx plus dividend equals cash flow or is it CapEx equals cash flow…
John Christmann: First of all, if we just take a single rig at Alpine High, it's less than two years before its self-funding. So, it really comes down to pace and how we want to scale that up. I mean that's the way you want to think about that. And that's fully burdened with infrastructure and midstream spend. And then secondly, when we do talk about our numbers, we've got our dividends dialed in. So our dividend payment has been dialed into our capital programs.
Michael Hall: And then I guess on the midstream side, as we think about monetization pads in 2018, can you maybe just kind of talk about the relative pros and cons you see for the different pads available and how important upfront cash flow is relative to longer-dated value capture.
Steve Riney: We're still in early days of looking at that. And looking at the options, we've got a lot to consider. It's not just about the assets that we own, it's about what's going on in the Permian Basin and what's going on between the Permian Basin and the Gulf Coast. So there's a lot of work to do just to get prepared to consider the question that you just asked. We're going to look at it from the perspective of what creates the most value for the shareholders long term and not so much about what creates cash flow in the short term. We'll certainly look at it from the perspective of how does that impact our strategic value for the upstream, making sure that we've still got adequate elements of control if you will to be able to make sure that the midstream serves the purpose of the upstream as opposed to the other way around. But beyond things like that, we're open to quite a few options and exploring what those options ought to look like before we start talking to anybody in earnest in the marketplace.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael McAllister with MUFG.
Michael McAllister: My question has to do with Alpine High midstream, when you talked about the cryogenic facility being built out in 2019, is that early 2019 or mid-2019, what's the thought on that?
Steve Riney: What we're looking at is something that would come available probably in the first half of '19. So it would be - so obviously something that we would start construction on in 2018.
Michael McAllister: And are there mechanical facilities in the budget for 2018 or we're going to just go with the 330 that are expected at the end of this year?
Steve Riney: No, there will be more. There will be more processing in the field during '18.
Michael McAllister: Do have a number or is it just contingent on the budget I guess activity?
Steve Riney: It's something that we haven't shared yet and we'll probably share that when we get to the '18 plan for - that we'll go through in the fourth quarter results in February.
Michael McAllister: What steps have you been taking for - there's not much NGL takeaway from there, what steps is Apache taking on that front.
Steve Riney: By the time we get to a cryo plant, we will obviously need pipe takeaway for liquids as well. So we are looking at that.
Operator: And we have no other question in queue at this time. And I would like to turn the call back over to Gary.
Gary Clark: Thanks everybody for joining us. We look forward to speaking to you again in February. In the meantime if you have any follow ups please call myself or Kian or Patrick on the IR team and we'd be happy to walk through anything you need. Thanks so much. Bye, bye.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's Apache Corporation third quarter earnings call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Apache Corporation's second quarter 2017 results earnings call. I would like to turn the call over to Gary Clark, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.
Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's second quarter 2017 financial and operational results conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; Executive Vice President of Operations Support, Tim Sullivan; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Steve Riney. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our second quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Please note that all currency references in our prepared remarks are in U.S. dollars. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. I will now turn the call over to John.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will: review our approach to navigating the lower-for-longer oil price environment; discuss the strategic rationale and financial benefits of our pending exit from Canada; provide current operational highlights, including Alpine High; and conclude with our thoughts around balancing funding and spending in 2018. Since the beginning of 2015, we have restructured our business to adapt and thrive in a lower-for-longer commodity price environment. The organization reacted swiftly to the downturn in oil prices. We stressed the importance of properly aligning cost structure with commodity prices as well as achieving and maintaining cash flow neutrality. We completed a series of transactions that simplified our portfolio. We reduced operating costs, overhead, and capital commitments, and significantly improved the balance sheet. With regard to our asset base and strategy, we successfully expanded and enhanced our organic unconventional North American acreage footprint and technical capabilities. We also focused our international capital spending to deliver strong and sustainable free cash flow from our core businesses in Egypt and the North Sea. These efforts were supported by significant improvements in our planning and capital allocation processes, which helped drive our strategy of returns-focused organic growth. In early 2017, WTI oil prices were trading above $50 per barrel, with the out years of the NYMEX strip trending even higher. We had concerns about the fundamentals underpinning this oil price optimism and the corresponding cash flows from operations. At the same time, we had just announced our discovery at Alpine High, a very attractive large-scale opportunity which would require significant near-term investment. Given our strong financial position, a cost structure that was now properly aligned with commodity prices, and a deep inventory of fully burdened high rate-of-return projects, we believed it was appropriate and value creating to budget a moderate outspend for the near term. Our general philosophy was that the upstream expenditures and dividends should be funded within cash flow while using a combination of non-core asset sales and the balance sheet to fund a viable midstream build-out at Alpine High. Accordingly, on our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we announced a 2017 capital budget based on a $50 WTI oil price, which at the time was conservative relative to the prevailing strip. We also announced that we had protected the 2017 capital program with put options at $50 WTI and $51 Brent for the majority of our oil production in the second half of the year. This helped to ensure our ability to fund the Alpine High capital program, which was strategically important to our long-term returns-focused growth strategy through a potentially volatile commodity price environment. Today, through the combination of expected cash flows from operations and proceeds from recent asset sales, our planned 2017 CapEx and dividends are funded. As a result, our $3.1 billion capital program remains unchanged. We expect to end 2017 with more cash and less debt, and we will have significantly higher production levels in the Permian Basin. I'd now like to comment on our exit from Canada, which we anticipate will be finalized upon the closing of two transactions later this month. From a strategic perspective, the sale of Canada further streamlines our portfolio and increases our North American leverage to the Permian Basin, which can be seen in our financial and operational supplement. While the Montney and Duvernay plays in Canada offer long-term growth potential, they are strategically disadvantaged relative to the other opportunities within our portfolio. Financially, Apache will realize several important benefits from the Canadian divestiture. In addition to the roughly $700 million headline sales price, the present value of asset retirement obligations on our balance sheet will be reduced by approximately $800 million. Gross cash overhead costs plus other corporate program costs will be reduced by approximately $70 million annually. Average cash margins per BOE, earnings per share, and free cash flow will be positively impacted, and return on capital employed at the corporate level will improve. I will conclude my remarks on Canada by noting that Apache is very grateful to the many employees who built this region over the years. We believe the employees and the assets will be well served under the new owners, who are eager to make significant capital investments in the business. Turning now to results and highlights from the quarter, oil and gas capital investment was $738 million in the second quarter, two-thirds of which was in the Permian Basin. Of this amount, Alpine High midstream expenditures were $128 million. Total first half 2017 capital investment of $1.4 billion is consistent with our planned full-year CapEx of $3.1 billion. As a reminder, this year we budgeted for an average well cost increase of 10% to 15% versus 2016 levels. And while we have seen price increases of 30% to 40% for certain service lines, our increased pad drilling operations coupled with other efficiencies and cost initiatives have resulted in average well cost at/or below budgeted levels. Tim will discuss this more in his remarks. As anticipated, our total daily production bottomed out in the second quarter, and we have shifted to a growth trajectory. We expect continued production volume increases at Alpine High and in the Midland Basin as well as our international regions during the second half of 2017. Now, I'd like to discuss some of our specific regional highlights, starting with Alpine High. As noted previously, we achieved first production at Alpine High in early May and exceeded our June 30 target of 50 million cubic feet per day of processed gas. Currently, our net sales gas exceeds 60 million cubic feet per day, and we anticipate this will increase to more than 100 million cubic feet per day by the end of September. Due to the timing of infrastructure build-out and gas takeaway, the majority of our Alpine High production thus far has come from our northernmost acreage. The drilling in this area has primarily been lease-retention-focused, and these wells are generally deeper and, thus, have a lower liquids content. The liquids ratio should increase as we drill and connect more wells in other areas of the play, and as we commission additional processing facilities. In the month of June, total Alpine High sales, net to Apache, averaged approximately 7,400 BOEs per day, of which approximately 10% was oil and natural gas liquids. As just mentioned, this liquids ratio should increase in the second half of the year. On the midstream side, we invested $270 million in the first half of 2017. Managing midstream internally provides Apache with operational flexibility and cost control benefits as we delineate the upstream and move into early-stage development. By retaining 100% ownership, we are investing in an asset that we believe will significantly increase in value as the upstream production and reserve potential are further demonstrated. Currently, our operational midstream facilities consist of 35 miles of 30-inch trunkline for gas takeaway, more than 40 miles of smaller diameter gathering lines, two central processing sites and eight central tank batteries. In addition, we have several significant midstream infrastructure milestones coming up in the second half of the year. In August, we will bring online our third central processing site followed by a fourth and fifth site in September, one of which will be located in the southern portion of the play. Also in September, we will connect our 30-inch trunkline to a market pipeline in the southern portion of the play, which will be capable of moving gas south to Mexico or north to the Waha Hub. Around year-end, we plan to have our sixth central processing site operational. In terms of new activity, we drilled four appraisal wells in the oil window of the Wolfcamp, Bone Springs parasequences at vertical depths ranging from 9,000 to 10,000 feet. We are excited about these wells, which have confirmed an over-pressured regime and 42-degree to 44-degree gravity oil. One of the wells, an approximate 4,500-foot lateral drilled in the Wolfcamp formation recorded a 30-day average rate in excess of 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With an oil cut of 70%, this well has cumulative production of approximately 37,000 barrels of oil in 75 days. A second well in the Wolfcamp is still cleaning up and producing around 400 barrels of oil per day. The third and fourth wells will be completed and begin flowing back shortly. We are pleased with the indications thus far from our oil bearing parasequence test at Alpine High. Early results from mapping and testing these zones gives us confidence at minimum in hundreds of drilling locations, and there is still a considerable amount of acreage in numerous landing zones to be tested. Optimization work is underway at Alpine High, and we are testing a number of different parameters across multiple formations to determine the best patterns, spacing, well-bore placement and completion designs. This process will be multifaceted and continuous. As we gather data and reach key conclusions, we will discuss them further with the market. On the costs side, we have made excellent progress and remain comfortable with our previous estimated average drilling and completion cost of $4 million to $6 million per well, despite the rising service cost environment. Overall, Alpine High operations are on track to progress to development. Trunkline and gathering system construction and takeaway connections are proceeding as expected, and our processing facilities are actively optimizing liquids recovery. From the wells connected and flowing thus far, we are seeing decline curves and pressure data consistent with our EUR projections. In addition to the Wolfcamp and Bone Springs parasequences I just mentioned, we continue to be very confident in our more than 3,000 wet-gas well location count, which remains highly economic at current or even lower prices. Turning now to the Midland Basin where our activity is primarily focused on multi-well pad drilling to the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations. In April, we brought the nine well Schrock 34 pad online at the Azalea field in Glasscock County. This pad exhibited strong performance with 60-day cumulative production exceeding our expectations. Average well costs were only $4.3 million, underscoring the significant efficiencies we are achieving in pad operations. In the second half of 2017, we have five additional multi-well pads scheduled to come online in the Midland Basin, which Tim will discuss in a moment. Internationally, we continued to generate strong free cash flow during the second quarter. In Egypt, our exploration program included two high-rate exploration discoveries with material potential for more activity in the Matruh Basin. As previously mentioned, we have received approval and expect to have signed agreements soon for two new concessions in Egypt. Combined, these blocks add approximately 1.6 million acres to Apache's footprint in the Western Desert, a 40% increase. With the opportunity set provided by these new concessions and the modern vintage 3-D seismic we are accumulating across our acreage in the Western Desert, we are very excited about the long-term potential in Egypt. Moving over to the North Sea; at Callater, we completed our facilities tieback ahead of schedule and proceeded with testing of the 18x discovery well in June. In July, we successfully tested a second well in an adjacent fault block. Both wells were recently brought online at a combined facilities-constrained rate of approximately 19,000 BOEs per day net to Apache, of which approximately 70% was oil and liquids. I'd like to close with a review of our 2018 capital budget and the flexibility we have around this program. Adjusted for the pending divestment of Canada, our planned capital budget for 2018 is $3.1 billion. This plan, which we announced in February, was based on $55 WTI oil and $3 NYMEX gas, and was designed to approximate cash flow neutrality, excluding Alpine High midstream investment. Our 2018 budget is flexible and can be adjusted in response to macro conditions, as every $5 per barrel change in oil prices impacts our cash flow by roughly $350 million. If necessary, we have numerous options available next year to manage a lower oil price environment. To begin with, we are maintaining the operational flexibility to reduce planned activity across most, if not all of our regions. Second, we believe costs in a sub-$55 oil price world would be lower than what we have estimated in our plan; and hence, the same overall activity set could be delivered for less than the $3.1 billion budget. Third, we could continue with the small asset package divestitures. Fourth, we have multiple options with respect to our Alpine High midstream assets, possibly initiating a monetization process or seeking third-party funding. And lastly, we could choose to utilize a portion of our significant cash position. What you can count on is that we will enter 2018 well prepared to manage a capital program commensurate with the prevailing price environment. We will do so with a keen focus on long-term returns, and we have no intention of stressing the balance sheet or diluting our shareholders. To wrap up, Apache is executing well on all fronts. Production is now growing in the U.S., as our Permian teams deliver strong drilling results in the Delaware and Midland Basins. In Egypt and the North Sea, we are bringing on several key wells which will provide production momentum in the second half of 2017. Across the company, we are successfully managing cost pressures and working diligently to manage LOE and G&A. In terms of our long-term growth and return expectations, we are making excellent progress incorporating or merging Alpine High outlook into our multiyear plan. As that full field development plan evolves, we will look to communicate some of the key elements of the multiyear plan to the investment community. Apache's balance sheet remains in great shape and our expected cash flow from oil production is well protected in the back half of this year. We look forward to entering 2018 in a strong financial position and continuing to create value with our differentiated, organic, unconventional exploration capabilities. I will now turn the call over to Tim to provide more operational details.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon. My remarks today will cover operational activity and key wells in our focus areas, new technologies we are applying to improve our performance and service and supply cost trends. Our second quarter production results reflect the lingering impact of last year's reduced capital and development activity. These effects, combined with the scheduled maintenance activities in Canada and the North Sea, contributed to a 3% production decrease on an adjusted basis from the preceding quarter. With those events behind us, we are shifting to a growth trajectory for the remainder of the year and beyond. During the second quarter, we increased activity at a measured pace, averaging 35 operated rigs worldwide with 17 in the Permian, 1 in the Mid-Continent, 13 in Egypt and 4 in the North Sea. In North America, second quarter 2017 production averaged 244,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 3% from the first quarter. In the Permian Basin, production of 146,000 BOE per day was flat compared to the preceding period. I'll begin with an overview of Alpine High in the Delaware Basin, where we have six rigs operating today. At quarter close, 11 wells were connected and producing into our midstream facilities, five of which were constrained to control flow as we commissioned newly-installed equipment and evaluated initial reservoir performance. Six wells were in various stages of flowback and testing, and 17 wells were waiting on completion, or shut-in waiting on infrastructure. Subsequent to quarter-end, we have connected additional wells, and production continues to impress. In addition to the Alpine High parasequence wells that John mentioned, we also recently completed a Barnett well with a test rate of more than 7.7 million cubic feet of gas, 400 barrels of oil and 450 barrels of NGLs per day from a 3,300-foot lateral. I would also note that we are seeing much more competitor activity around Alpine High. Offset operators have drilled or were drilling 16 wells with another 28 competitor wells permitted. As we drill more wells, we are also seeing improvements on the costs side. We are utilizing a spudder rig to set surface casing in an effort to reduce shallow hole cost associated with high-demand larger rigs. In addition, we have been successful in the elimination of the casing string in some areas, and reduced drill time in the intermediate and lateral sections of the well. All-in costs for these wells are on track to fall within our targeted range of $4 million to $6 million. Elsewhere in the Delaware Basin, in our Mentone field north of the Alpine High, we brought online a five-well pad at the Magpie unit. These wells were drilled with 1-mile laterals in the third Bone Springs and achieved an average 30-day IP rate in excess of 1,000 BOE per day and an average cost of $4.5 million per well. In the Midland Basin, we are primarily focused on drilling larger multi-well pads. The nine-well Schrock 34 pad in our Azalea field is contributing strong performance. This mile-long pad was designed as a spacing and landing zone test with completion in the Wolfcamp A1, B1 and B3. In addition to this pad, we drilled the Calverley 2932 1H, a 1.5-mile lateral that is the first well of a future nine-well pad. 30-day IPs from these 10 Azalea wells averaged approximately 950 BOE per day, with a 75% oil cut. In the Powell Field, we completed the first two wells on two separate pads, where we plan to drill a total of 12 wells each in the Wolfcamp B formation. One pad has a mile laterals and achieved a 30-day average IP rate of nearly 900 BOE per day. The other pad has a 1.5-mile laterals and achieved an average 30-day IP rate of just under 1,300 BOE per day. During the second half of 2017, we plan to bring online approximately 30 Midland Basin wells, most of them having extended laterals of 1.5 miles or longer. I'll turn now to our international assets. Adjusted production in Egypt, which excludes minority interest and the impact of tax barrels, increased slightly from the first quarter 2017 to 89,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We had several exploration and development highlights from the Egyptian drilling program during the second quarter, primarily in our legacy Matruh Basin. We are developing new concepts in this mature basin, which is leading to greater results from great rock. We tested two zones at the Herunefer West 1X well. The AEB tested 5,900 BOE per day, and the Lower Safa tested 4,500 BOE per day. The discovery established our thickest pay interval to date within the basin, logging approximately 400 feet of total net pay in the Safa and AEB formations. It also sets up several development locations and derisks additional exploration prospects on trend. Also in the Matruh Basin, the Bravo 2X tested at nearly 4,100 BOE per day from 78 feet of pay in the Safa, with additional pay behind pipe. In Egypt, during the first half of 2017, we have drilled a total of 43 wells with a 77% success rate. Notably, 22 of the 33 producers have exhibited extremely high test rates exceeding 1,000 BOE per day, with successes spanning five different basins. Keep in mind that these are vertical wells with completed well costs of approximately $3 million. We have also performed 18 recompletions this year, with flow rates also exceeding 1,000 BOE per day. I'll move now to our North Sea region. Due to scheduled maintenance activity at the Beryl platforms, our production declined to 55,000 BOE per day during the second quarter of 2017. This was better than expected, as equipment deliveries necessary for the planned maintenance turnarounds were delayed, so the tar started later than planned. We used this delay to accelerate testing of our first well at Callater, the 18x. As previously disclosed, the lower half of the 18x tested at a peak 24-hour rate of more than 15,000 barrels of oil and 28 million cubic feet of gas. This was stronger than expected and nearly equivalent to the rate that we had forecasted for the entire well. Subsequent to the second quarter end, we tested the upper half of the Callater 18x, and it flowed at a peak 24-hour rate of more than 19,000 BOE per day with a 69% oil cut. As John noted, we also recently completed a second well at Callater in the adjacent fault block. The CB2 tested at a very strong 24-hour rate of more than 11,000 BOE per day with a 65% oil cut. With both wells flowing at Callater, we expect the North Sea will deliver higher production levels in the second half of the year. In addition to the progress at Callater, we drilled the BLB, an infill well at Beryl Bravo platform. This well flowed at a 30-day initial production rate averaging nearly 6,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with an 82% oil cut from the Nansen reservoir. Please refer to our financial and operational supplement for more details on our second quarter production. Across our portfolio, we are implementing new technologies to improve the data we use to explore the subsurface, increase operational efficiencies, reduce costs, and improve hydrocarbon recoveries while optimizing net present value. We are taking an integrated geoscience and engineering approach to these initiatives. In the Permian, both in the Delaware and Midland Basins, we are collecting massive amounts of data from multiple sources. On a single pad, to better understand reservoir performance, we have obtained or installed downhole microseismic data, surface vertical seismic profiles, fiber optics collecting pressure and temperature data, downhole pressure monitors, and oil and chemical tracers. This data collection and analysis will provide us unprecedented insight into the effect of our stimulations on the rock fabric. Ultimately, it will allow us to optimize well placement and spacing. Apache also has been building new state-of-the-art water treatment and recycling facilities, including large, highly engineered water storage pits in both Midland and the Delaware Basins. These facilities directly add value to our projects by reducing water costs and increasing reliability and flexibility. Finally, Apache is developing new workflows and technologies that allow for rapid characterization of thousands of feet of core and quickly getting this into the hands of geologists and engineers for faster characterization of shale plays and landing zones. Overall, we are building a far more robust understanding of our conventional and unconventional plays and their performance than was previously possible. Instead of just gathering data, we are owning, maintaining, validating, and optimizing the use of the data to add value to our assets. I'll move now to service costs. This is a positive execution story, as we've been able to effectively maintain the lower cost structure achieved in 2016. As John noted, we anticipated much of the inflation we're seeing today and have been successful offsetting it with operational efficiencies and service contracts. Overall costs for North America were essentially flat in the second quarter of 2017 compared with the first quarter. We do not expect rising service costs to materially impact our activity or budget for the remainder of 2017. We continue to see cost inflation for certain services and supplies, primarily for pressure pumping and sand in West Texas, where spot market prices continue to trend upward. Hoping to offset this, we are sourcing low-cost sands that are delivered from local mines in the Permian Basin, reducing transportation costs considerably. We also entered into contracts with pricing indexed to WTI, which protects against a portion of those increases. Internationally, costs are tracking as expected. During the third quarter, the current contract on Ocean Patriot expires, and we've renewed the semisubmersible drilling rig at a considerably lower day rate. This will reduce our North Sea drilling costs in 2018 and 2019, with an option for a third year. I will conclude by noting that we have increased activity in North America at a very measured pace and generally avoided direct competition for equipment and services at spot market rates. We are focused on generating strong, fully burdened returns. And as indicated by our guidance, growth will follow in the second half of 2017. Despite industry cost pressures, we believe our 2017 North America operations are more capital efficient than in previous years. I will now turn the call over to Steve.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Tim, and, good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I will review our second quarter financial results. I will provide an update on quarterly and annual guidance items, which will reflect the full anticipated effect of Apache's exit from Canada. And lastly, I will comment on our updated hedges and the continuing strength of our financial position. Let me begin with second quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, Apache reported net income of $572 million or $1.50 per diluted common share. Earnings were positively impacted by a net deferred income tax benefit related to a financial restructuring in Canada in preparation for the exit. This consists primarily of a $678 million reduction in a U.S. deferred income tax liability with respect to untaxed foreign source earnings. Together with some other smaller adjustments, the total tax benefit excluded for purposes of calculating adjusted earnings is $670 million. Results for the quarter also included a number of other items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates. These include a $26 million unrealized mark-to-market gain on our commodity price hedge positions, $25 million of unproved acreage impairment and $18 million of loss related to recent divestitures. Excluding these and other items, our adjusted loss for the quarter was $79 million or $0.21 per share. Note, this adjusted earnings still includes the effect of dry-hole costs incurred of $46 million or $0.08 per share after tax. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $751 million. This includes a working capital benefit of $148 million. Our cash position on June 30 was $1.7 billion, a slight increase from the previous quarter. Turning to costs, lease operating expenses in the second quarter were $8.81 per parallel of oil equivalent, an increase over the first quarter rate. This increase was anticipated and is primarily attributable to seasonal maintenance activity in our North Sea business. Our first half 2017 LOE was $8.27 per barrel of oil equivalent, which is in line with our guidance for the full year of $8.25 to $8.75 per BOE. Exploration expense in the second quarter was $108 million, $85 million of which was attributable to dry-hole expense and unproved leasehold impairments. Now I'll move to guidance, and today we are mending several of our 2017 guidance ranges to reflect the impact of Apache's pending exit from Canada. As previously announced, we are exiting our Canada business via three separate transactions. Our 2017 updated guidance is provided on pages 22 and 23 of the supplement. All new guidance now reflects Canada results through the actual or anticipated transaction closing dates. As a reminder, the first of these three transactions closed on June 30, and the other two transactions are expected to close in August. Additionally, on pages 19 through 21 of our supplement, we have provided new adjusted quarterly production guidance which excludes Canada from all quarters in 2017. I will walk through some of these guidance items, but my comments will be relatively brief. So feel free to follow up with Gary and his team with any questions you may have. Beginning with our adjusted North American production guidance on page 19 of the supplement, we have removed actual and projected Canadian production for all of the periods shown. We have also tightened our forward-looking guidance ranges reflecting more clarity around our second half production ramp, particularly at Alpine High. On the international side, our adjusted production guidance remains essentially unchanged. However, I would like to note that Egypt tax barrel guidance for reporting purposes has decreased by 10,000 BOEs per day, which is primarily driven by a lower commodity price outlook and thus lower taxable income in Egypt. With regard to capital, our $3.1 billion 2017 budget is not impacted by the Canada exit, since most of the capital allocated to the Canada region this year will have been spend by the time the transactions have closed. The exit from Canada will reduce our planned 2018 capital budget by approximately $125 million. Turning to guidance for expenses, on page 23 of the supplement, you will note that we reduced annual guidance for G&A expenses by $25 million and for gathering and transportation expenses by $20 million to $30 million, both primarily to reflect the Canada exit. Note that our DD&A guidance for 2017 has increased slightly on a BOE basis since our Canada business had a relatively low carrying value. Moving now to hedging, in addition to our oil PUDs, we have begun adding some gas hedges. For the second half of 2017, we have now swapped an average of 33,750 MMBtu per day of gas volumes at an average price of $3.36. More significantly, we have begun hedging our first quarter 2018 gas volumes with 150,000 MMBtu per day swapped at an average price of $3.39. As a reminder, the primary goal of our hedging activity is to protect the pace and delivery of a strategically important capital program at Alpine High. This continues to be the case as we look to 2018. We do not use hedging to speculate on price. I would like to conclude by emphasizing Apache's financial strength. This is a product of our disciplined approach over the last few years. As I indicated previously, our cash position has been growing and net debt is down $355 million since the beginning of the year. For the remainder of the year, our cash flow is well protected with our price hedges, so our ability to fund the capital program and dividend payment without utilizing the balance sheet is secure. We are well prepared for continued volatility in oil and gas prices. We continue to balance the need to flex the capital program commensurate with the price environment, while also funding our long-term strategy. Throughout this effort, we focus on investments that will deliver sound full-cycle economics at current or even lower commodity prices. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Our first question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.
Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: A question on the Midland Basin. There's been a lot of talk amongst investors about rising gas-oil ratios in that play and the potential that they're displacing forecasted oil type curves. What's your view on that? How do we think about your GORs in the Midland?
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: This is Tim. In the Midland Basin, our shale wells, they're performing in line with our type curves. We really haven't been surprised by the GORs. We understand the producing characteristics of our different areas that we operate in. And our GORs are performing as we would have expected.
Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thanks. The other is, do you have an estimate of where you were Alpine High sort of end of – or currently or call it the end of 2Q?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Actually in the prepared remarks, Bob, we said we produced 7,400 BOEs a day net to Apache. 10% of that was liquids and almost all of that was oil in the month of June.
Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Got you. Thank you.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: You bet. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Good afternoon. John, I wondered if you could give us a little bit more detail. In your prepared comments you talked a little bit about how you expect Alpine High to perform in the northern part of the field versus the south. So I wondered if you can give us a little bit more color around that.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: I mean, Arun, I think the good news is, is we got online early. We were scheduled to bring everything on July 1. We have some of the stuff to talk about in the second quarter, because we were able to bring things on in early May. Things are progressing really as planned. We were able to sell net to Apache 7,400 BOEs a day in the month of June. And like I said, we've been bringing up the CPFs. If you look at kind of where we are today on the infrastructure, we now have 35 miles of the 30-inch trunkline in. We've got over 40 miles of gathering in. There are two CPFs that are operating with eight tank batteries. And then in August and September, we've got our third CPF coming in – coming on in August, fourth and fifth in September, as well as a connection to the south. And so what we've said is, our volumes are – we're currently producing about 60 million a day net to Apache. You're going to see that grow to 100 by September. And you're going to see the liquids ratio grow as well, especially as we start to bring on more NGLs. So a lot of exciting things. We only had 11 wells on in the quarter, and really five of those have been constrained. So we're really, really just getting started.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got you. Got you. And then, just in terms of – you talked about by year-end getting to six CPFs. What type of productive capacity do you get from six CPFs?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: We've said that we're going to be bringing on these CPFs in increments, 50 million to 100 million a day. They're all going to be able to be incrementally added. So what we've done is given you volume forecast and guidance. Right now, we are constrained, but we hope to resolve that as we catch up, as these things come on in the next couple of months. And then, from there, we hope to have more capacity than we'll have volumes.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got you. And just my follow-up is just in Egypt, what is your plan to explore on some of the new licensed acreage that you've received, I think, earlier this year?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It's going to – it depends on the timing. Right now, as we've said, we're shooting a brand new high-res 3-D across our existing acreage. And as well, we'll be shooting the new permits as soon as we get the final documents signed. Everything's approved. We're just waiting on the final documents. So that should happen here pretty soon. We'll get started on the seismic in this fall, and we could potentially drill our first well this fall. We see a lot of low-hanging fruit, and we're very, very excited about the potential. I mean, they're very large concessions. We know a lot about them. And – I mean, they're going to be a real, real shot in the arm. You got to go back to over 10 years since we've had two new concessions. Not anything of this size either, so it's going to be a real shot in the arm for our Egypt production, maybe late this year, most likely as you start to go into 2018, 2019, and beyond.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right, good afternoon. John, could you talk about – do you guys have a definitive timeline as far as when we'll get more clarity around the potential resource at Alpine High?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: David, as we've said, we're ramping up most of our wells, like the wells we disclosed on the last earnings call. We cleaned them up and shut them in. Most wells have been waiting. We've got – as Tim said in his notes, we've got a lot of wells waiting on the infrastructure. Now that we have the facilities and things, it doesn't make a lot of sense to be flaring volumes and things. And so, as we bring more things on, I think you're going to continue to see a lot of data coming. And when we get to a point that it makes sense to talk more definitively, what we really want to do is get the processing facilities lined out, get more time behind the wells, continue with our optimization work, and at some point, we'll come back with something very meaningful and very definitive. But I think what we've continued to state is that we feel very, very good that we have more than 3,000 wet gas locations. Your best EURs would be to look at what we disclosed at Barclays almost a year ago. And now we said with the two Wolfcamp wells that are, by the way, in two different zones in the Wolfcamp, in a significant distance between those wells, we feel very confident now that we have hundreds of locations in the Wolfcamp, so – that will be oil locations. And – so we'll come back as we get more data. We're really just getting started with our infrastructure and being able to bring things on and produce them into ideal production situations.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. I think – let me just stay with Alpine High then. Midstream, future funding, there's been a lot of talk about whether you sell it, whether you bring a partner in, whether you're going to go out alone. Any additional color you can give us on that?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, I think what you've seen is this year we had an outspend on our infrastructure side and now we've more than covered that. As we look at 2018, we – the 2018 budget had originally looked at $55 as a price target. We've said that there are lots of options we have on that. Our spend in 2018 is planned around $500 million. We're probably going to pull some of that into this year as we stated within our $3.1 billion budget. So we feel very comfortable that we're going to be able to handle that funding without having to stress the balance sheet, issue equity, or really put ourselves in a bind.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right, thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon, thanks. In the Alpine High, specifically on the oil zone test, I realize that it's early. But can you speak to your initial thoughts on the deposition of both the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring across your position?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It's going be very similar, the parasequences. So they were laid down at a time when you had very rapidly rising sea level. And so there is some discontinuity in them just like there is in all of the Delaware Basin, so very similar. And so you've got a lot of mixed things in there. But we're very excited about what we've got. And these two wells are going to perform very similar to the other wells in the Delaware Basin.
Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Great. And then staying in the Alpine High but on optimized completions, can you give us some detail on what you're testing, when we can expect to hear more, and what early indications you have, if any?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: When we talk about optimization, there's really a lot of things. It involves targeting, spacing tests, pattern tests, landing zone, lateral length, the orientation, and in the completion design. And even in the completion design, you've got your fluids in terms of your volumes, your sand concentrations, the stages, clusters, everything. So we have begun the optimization process. We've actually had 11 wells into the system at the end of the quarter. As we bring more in, clearly we're going about it very methodically like we have the whole play. And as we get to points where we draw some conclusions, we'll start to make those more clear. But we're doing a lot of things. We've got some longer laterals. We've got some larger fracs, targeting, azimuth, everything.
Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good afternoon.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Hey, Brian.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: A couple follow-ups on the capital allocation question. When you say moderate outspend for the near term, can you add more color on the length and threshold for that outspending? And I guess relatedly, if Alpine High midstream is where you see the outspend happening, when does the midstream achieve critical mass, and then when would we expect the outspend to end?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: When we think about – right now we're just talking 2017 and 2018 is what we've been looking at. So if you look at 2017 and 2018, that would be that time period. I think the important thing with our infrastructure at Alpine High is it's going reach a critical mass where we really believe middle of next year we could be in a position to start to monetize a portion of it or do something there. So we'll look at 2018 as we start to roll into – later this year or early next year, we'll start to give another look into 2018 and beyond. But we're looking right now at 2018. The other thing I'll say about 2018 as our original budget had it – which is really flat activity to this year, had a $55 deck in there. $5 in oil price means about $350 million of cash flow to us. And so we see we have a lot of flexibility with our program. One, we can reduce activity. Two, if we really are in a sub-$55 world next year, then our cost structure is going be lower than what we have in that budget. So there will be the ability to get more for that activity set. I think we've shown this year we can do some non-material asset sales, which I would not put the strategic exit from Canada in that bucket. I've touched on the Alpine High midstream, and then we also have a very nice $1.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you. And then switching to the Alpine High Wolfcamp oil well, the first well that you announced where you talked about 1,000 BOE a day, it looks like that would imply about 700 barrels a day of oil in the first month, and then about 350 to 360 barrels a day for the remainder of the 75 days. I just wanted to check in on both your expectations for well costs for these wells and then if these rates are in line with your type curve and what rates you're looking for from the next batch of wells.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It looks really good. I think the thing we'll say, number one, it's approximately 4,500 foot lateral. It has come on 70% oil. And the 30-day average is actually greater than 1,000 BOEs a day, and it did produce 37,000 barrels of oil in the first 75 days. A lot of the research this morning has come out tagging that as BOE, which is not correct. Very typical profile to a lot of the other Delaware wells. Good charge. We'll have more water than we'll have in our resource zones in the Woodford, Barnett to pin, so it's going to be very typical characteristics and very, very strong profile, and performing very, very well.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company LLC: Good afternoon, John, to you and the rest of your team there.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Hi, Charles.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company LLC: Thank you. You guys have fielded a lot of Alpine High questions, so I'm going to go a slightly different direction. I think you – perhaps Tim hinted at this in some of his earlier comments. When I look at the wells you guys have drilled already, you've drilled 1-mile laterals with a significantly lower completed well cost than your peers have been delivering in the area. But I think what I heard is that going forward, at least in the back half of 2017, you guys are going be going after longer laterals which presumably will have some higher completed well costs. And I wonder if you could characterize for us where you think you are on your optimization of your well design and your completion time design for those Midland Basin wells.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Charles, what we've been doing primarily is we've been drilling mile laterals in our three core focus areas; Wildfire, Powell, and Azalea. If you go back to 2016, we changed our completions dramatically since then. And one thing I might note though, if you look at our completed costs from 2016 to today on those mile laterals, our completed well costs have remained relatively unchanged at about $4.5 million. And a lot of that has been the conversion from drilling one-offs to going to pad drilling and getting the efficiencies obviously from batch drilling and the savings that we see there. Going forward, we've got about 30 wells. We've got about five different pads that we anticipate we're going bring online in the second half, and most of those are going be mile and a half type laterals. And we are still doing a little bit of spacing testing and landing zone testing along with this development drilling that we're doing as well. So the completions are still – we're still working on them, and every area is a little bit different, so I don't think we'll ever get to one completion design that will be standardized across the entire play. It's going be tailored to the type of rock that we've got at each field that we have. So it's something that we will continue to optimize, and we'll really never be done with that process.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company LLC: Okay, thank you for that, Tim. And then if I could ask a question about the North Sea, and you had those impressive well results with Callater. And I'm wondering if you can guide our expectations a bit with respect to North Sea results going forward. Should we look at Callater and particularly at the idea that this most impressive well was on offset fault block? Should we be looking for more sorts of results like this, or is this a one-off sort of thing that we ought not look for a repeat?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Callater is a well we disclosed in 2015. It was a new discovery. There will be some offsets. We announced another fault block there with that, so we're very excited about the area. I think the best thing to do in terms of forecast is just look at what we've guided to, Charles. I mean, we've had this well planned in and this development baked in. It's really a function of the exploration program. We've had a series of announced discoveries over the last couple of years that are in the queue to be coming on in the future, and Callater is kind of in the first of those that we're tying in, in 2017, so...
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe I'll bring it back to the Alpine High. And maybe I missed it, but when do you guys expect to reveal the larger development plan you discussed in the call? Is it – is that in connection with the 2018 CapEx budget? And if there's no specific date, what still needs to happen there before you feel confident in that plan?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, we feel confident in the plan, Evan. I mean, obviously, we gave guidance this year for a two-year look. We've given you a 2018 4Q exit rate, and we didn't touch any of those numbers this quarter. In fact, didn't really touch our guidance at all, other than adjusting for Canada. So we have a plan that we're working on. We're always updating it with new data. We've still got a lot of areas we are testing and bringing things in, but we have a base plan and we gave you a two-year look at it this year. Obviously, we'll choose as we're phasing in and bringing things on. We've said we're at 60 million a day net today, and we'll be north of 100 million in September. And as we get more color and continue, we'll come at it sometime in the future and give you a longer look. But we gave you a good two-year look, and for now, we have a lot of confidence in that.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And maybe to follow up on that, the 100 million guide, can you walk us through how that estimate is billed? Meaning, how many wells are connected and what percentage of them will be on constrained flow because it's harder to – it's harder to kind of model for us?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: The better thing to do is look at the numbers we gave you and run off of those, because we've gone end of the first – end of the second quarter we had 11 wells on and five of them are constrained. And we should get to a point where we don't have constrained wells as we get these next three CPFs up over the August and September timeframe. But we haven't given an absolute well count, as that's dynamic. But what we have given you is ranges, Evan. And we said, in June we produced 7,400 barrels of oil equivalent a day net. It's not gross; that's net. And it was 10% liquids, and almost all of that was oil. And the liquids ratio is going to grow as the volume grows in the future.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of James Sullivan with Alembic Global Advisors.
James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Hey. Good morning – good afternoon, guys, there. I just wanted to go back to that Wolfcamp oil well real quick. You talked, John, about there being a nice charge in that well there, and a couple of comments on the overpressure there. Could you just talk about how you released that well, I mean, in terms of initial chokes and how you were kind of letting it out there? Any color you can give on that would be great. And on pressure drawdowns, too.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It's just a very, very strong well. We've flown it back naturally, and there is a sub pump in there today. And it's very typical to the other wells we have and the other areas of the Delaware Basin.
James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Okay. Great. Sounds good. Just on – over to the North Sea real quick, you guys did the turnaround over there. Can you quantify the amount of volume that was offline there for the quarter?
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: For the second quarter, it was just under 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That was offline. Some of that turnaround got pushed into the third quarter. So we'll see some downtime from turnarounds in the third quarter as well.
James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Okay. And then Q4 will be more like your run rate?
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Correct.
James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Great, thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Thanks. I guess just a couple on my end. As it relates to the DUCs and wells waiting on infrastructure and just I guess general backlog in the Alpine High, how many of those at present are currently in the oilier zone?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yeah. Right now, Michael, we've got a mix. We haven't given breakdowns on that. You've got a range, some of those are going be wet gas wells. Some of them are going to be – there's a few we've got several that are in flow-back. So it will be a mix kind of like we have across our play.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Okay. But specific to the Wolfcamp or Bone Spring, you don't, by chance, have that available?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: There's going be more than two, and I'll just say that.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Okay, fair enough. And then I guess the other was just still on the Permian, but higher level. I was just curious when you guys think you'll see oil volumes in the Permian turn around? They've been obviously on decline, but you've got a big back-half ramp that you've outlined. Do you think we'll see sequential growth in oil volumes in the third quarter or how should we think about that?
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Yeah. So, we have turned the corner now on growth, not only in international and in North America, but just on North – our Permian oil growth will be – continually grow quarter-after-quarter.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers.
Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good afternoon.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Hey, Jeff.
Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Hey, John. In the Permian Basin, many producers are moving towards completing all the locations of a given zone or maybe even several zones and wants to avoid well interference and enhance efficiencies. I was just wondering what is your completion approach as you're increasingly focusing on drilling more wells and zones per pad.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: That's a novel idea. We've always talked about – ultimately you do your testing, so you can get to pad development, and that is the optimal way to do that. So you want to get in the pads where you can develop the rock and produce it in the best way, shape or form. So it's exactly the approach we're taking. That's – we've got some 10, 11 well pads coming on later this year in Midland Basin. So I mean it's clearly the direction you want to go with all of it.
Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And my other question is in Egypt. With the large increase in acreage, how will you allocate capital there over the next year or two? I mean, obviously you're having great success in the areas where you have concentrated operations. So I'm just wondering how will exploration spend on the new acreage look relative to the spending as a whole.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It's probably going be pretty similar to how it's been. I mean, we drill quite a few exploration wells in Egypt every year anyways. So as Egypt continues to generate more free cash flow, potentially you could see more capital. But we're not going to change philosophically how we're thinking about that. But it's an exciting place. I mean, I think we're going to find ourselves with better – some pretty strong deliverability things, much like Ptah and Berenice have been over the last couple of years. So a lot of low-hanging fruit that should help us with volumes and also with the ability to generate more free cash flow and also reinvest more.
Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our last question is from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, everybody. Good afternoon and thank you for getting me on, John. John, you guys are...
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Only for you, Doug.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I'm trying to take advantage of you a little bit here, John, because you're uniquely qualified with your background and your vertical well inventory for the history of Apache to really opine on this issue that, I guess, Bob brought up earlier. Obviously, sector is getting annihilated in the back of this GOR issue. So I'm wondering if you could take just a little bit of time and just maybe do the market a favor and explain what you meant by the type curve or the gas breakout, the GOR has not changed adverse to your expectations. And what I'm getting at is the difference between the pressure drawdown in the vertical versus the pressure drawdown in the horizontal. What are you seeing there? Is there anything different in the oil recovery in your Midland Basin wells versus what you expected and versus what you've planned on based on that vertical well history? Because there seems to be a little bit of a panic going on that this is actually a deterioration of oil recovery as opposed to an enhancement of gas and NGL recovery. Could I ask you to...
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: I'll say a few things. Number one, we've always forecasted our oil and gas streams separately. Like – I mean, it's just fundamental petroleum engineering. Anybody forecasting BOE curves and you've got changing dynamics out there you have to model it. I mean, it's like anything else though, Doug. You do your core work, you do your fluid analysis, you look at your pressure and temperature data. And we can model that. We've got a lot of history and we do a lot of time modeling that. And so our wells are producing and – as our type curves are laid out. And we have not had any surprises in terms of the forecasted volumes with how they are performing. Areas behave differently. And if we go back to some of our earlier areas where we drilled some wells in 2010 and 2011, they were in a little less mature area, a little higher GORs, they're going to behave differently. We've got a lot of history and have a deep understanding of how this works. And so we're not surprised by the GORs and you have to examine those very carefully. And – but every rock, every area, the rocks will differ depending on the play, and that's why it takes time to collect the data properly, do the core work, do the fluid work, do the pressure work and create your material balance just like you would in conventional rock. But there's a difference.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I appreciate that.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: There's just a real difference between how conventional and unconventional reservoirs behave and there's a difference how they behave over time. And you'll see contribution from different types of the fabric as it goes forward.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So just to be clear, I know we're out of time here. So if I could just add two quick pieces to that, one is, related to that, the vertical pressure drawdown versus a horizontal pressure drawdown, would you concur with the idea that the horizontal is getting the gas breakout quicker but not changing the material balance?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: I wouldn't say that rock is going to drawdown and break out exactly how it's exposed to the surface. So that's just a function of temperature and pressure and the drawdown. The orientation of the well isn't going to have as big of an impact as just how the rock is going to behave under pressure and temperature and how the makeup of it is.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And my last one is more Apache-specific. What do you need to see to declare a broader oil inventory in the Alpine High? Obviously, you've given another couple of wells today. And if I may, when that happens, I assume it's going to happen at some point, would it change your targeting on how your initial development plan versus – oil versus gas? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: I'd say any incremental well, obviously, you tweak your plans as you go through it. You'll see more from us as we bring more wells out. We've had 11 wells on the end of June, half of them, or five of them were flowing constrained. We've just got a lot of data coming over the next couple of quarters. But it's very exciting. We're going to be very deliberate on what we disclose. We're not going to come out with big location counts unless we're confident in those location counts. And there's a lot of rock to test even in our parasequence zones. So there's a lot of exciting things. We've got a big thick column, 5,000 feet of hydrocarbons over a 65-mile area down there, and a lot of rock to work with, so you're going to see a lot more locations coming out of us in the future.
Operator: And that does conclude the Q&A portion of this call today. Thank you for your participation. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Apache Corporation First Quarter 2017 Results Earnings Call. I would like to turn the call over to Gary Clark, Vice President-Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.
Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's first quarter 2017 financial and operational results conference call. Speakers' making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; Executive Vice President of Operations Support, Tim Sullivan; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Steve Riney. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our first quarter Financial and Operational Supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. Please note that the details of our 2017 production guidance increase can be found on pages 21 through 24 of the supplement. On today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Consistent with previous reporting practices, production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. And I will now turn the call over to John.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will discuss our strategy for delivering returns-focused growth, review our first quarter 2017 accomplishments, provide an overview of our international operations, and conclude with an update on the progress of our Permian Basin growth initiatives in the Midland Basin and at Alpine High. As I reflect over the last two years, I see tremendous progress at Apache. We've streamlined our portfolio, allowing us to focus our capital and allocate it more efficiently to organic growth opportunities in North America and toward free cash flow maintenance in Egypt and the North Sea. We are benefiting from actions taken to strengthen the balance sheet, budget conservatively, and manage to cash flow neutrality. We've realigned our overhead and operating cost structures to achieve profitability in a lower commodity price environment. We've demonstrated an ability to grow organically by bringing forward a differentiated, low-cost, unconventional play in the Delaware Basin at Alpine High. And finally, we have a much deeper understanding of each hydrocarbon system within the portfolio, which has led to a significant improvement in well results and a larger, higher-quality drilling inventory with greater resource potential. As a result, we are a different company today. One that is capable of delivering highly competitive per share growth rates and double-digit returns, while living within cash flow in a $50 oil price world. As we stated last quarter, Apache's overarching objective is to deliver long-term returns-focused growth. Key components for achieving this include: budgeting conservatively and maintaining the flexibility to accelerate activity, if warranted; increasing capital allocation to the Midland and Delaware basins to fund Apache's very attractive growth areas; preparing for long-term development at Alpine High by completing our resource appraisal program, conducting optimization and spacing tests, and installing necessary infrastructure; investing to sustain long-term free cash flow generation from Egypt and the North Sea; relentlessly focusing on cost and well optimization to achieve the highest returns and net present value from our assets; and actively managing our portfolio with a long-term perspective and strategically redeploying capital to our highest value opportunities. We continue to make excellent progress on all of these objectives. Before moving into the first quarter, I would like to touch briefly on oil prices. As a reminder, Apache's 2017 capital budget assumes flat oil prices of $50 per barrel WTI and $51 per barrel Brent. You will recall that we've protected these prices for the second half of the year with put options on most of our anticipated oil volumes. Oil prices have been volatile year-to-date, with WTI ranging from a high around $55 to a low of $47 per barrel. As the process of working off historically high worldwide crude oil inventories unfolds, we anticipated significant volatility and planned accordingly. We have both the capital budget and the price protection we need for this environment. Regardless of where oil prices go for the remainder of the year, our capital program is well protected and we have maintained full upside leverage to any price improvement. Now, let me highlight our first quarter accomplishments. After an extended downturn, Apache returned to profitability on both a reported and adjusted earnings basis. It was also the fourth quarter in a row that our cash flow from operations, before changes in working capital, exceeded capital expenditures as we continue to exercise spending discipline with oil in the $50 range. We significantly increased activity in the Permian Basin, with roughly two-thirds of our first quarter capital focused in the core Midland Basin and Alpine High. Our midstream buildout at Alpine High is ahead of schedule and under budget. This enabled us to bring the first phase of production online two months early, which is providing two important benefits. First, as a result of this week's startup of Alpine High production, we are raising our full-year 2017 North American production guidance. Our Financial and Operational Supplement issued this morning describes this increase in more detail. Second, we're accelerating some of our planned 2018 infrastructure build into 2017, with no corresponding increase in our capital budget. Also, during the quarter, we continue to make good progress on the cost side in the face of inflationary pressures, delivering capital costs and lease operating expenses below plan. And lastly, we closed two non-core Permian acreage transactions for cash proceeds of $440 million, receiving a very attractive per acre price. Turning now to some of the operational details for the first quarter. Internationally, Egypt and the North Sea produced approximately 147,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on an adjusted basis; and, together, are tracking in line with our expectations. Lower-than-expected gas production in the North Sea was offset by better-than-expected production in Egypt. Together, these regions contributed strong free cash flow during the quarter, underscoring their strategic fit in our portfolio. Our strategy in Egypt and the North Sea is to continue to invest at a level that sustains free cash flow generation. Both regions have extensive infrastructure in place. Our capital programs look to leverage that infrastructure through a robust inventory of development drilling and step-out exploration prospects. In Egypt, we continue to have success drilling high-rate exploration and development wells, which are generally offsetting natural field declines. This year, we will initiate a new, high-resolution 3-D seismic survey in the Western Desert. This will include our two new concessions, which add nearly 40% to our acreage footprint in the region. We believe that the new seismic program and acreage additions will yield additional attractive growth opportunities. In the North Sea, we currently have two platform rigs running and one semi-submersible. As discussed in February, our second quarter production will be down, primarily due to accelerated annual maintenance activities to accommodate the installation of subsea tieback facilities for our Callater discovery. Callater remains on schedule for first production in the third quarter of 2017 and should drive a material uptick in second half production levels. During the first quarter, the North Sea benefited from premium natural gas and Brent oil prices, and the region continues to generate Apache's highest cash margins per BOE. In Suriname, the Kolibrie 1 exploration well in Block 53 reached TD in April and was deemed non-commercial. Well costs were significantly below our budget as we drilled the well very quickly and efficiently. We gained valuable information about the basin from this well, and are evaluating our next steps in Block 53. On Block 58, where we hold 100% working interest, we are currently processing 3D seismic and are seeing positive early indications of very significant potential. We remain enthusiastic about our prospects in Suriname. Turning now to North America, production averaged approximately 252,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with each region performing in line with expectations. Total oil and gas capital investment in North America was approximately $500 million, which was below budget. In 2017, we plan for an average well cost increase of 10% to 15%. However, proactive measures taken to contain inflationary pressures on certain services are helping to sustain some of the lower cost structure we worked so hard to achieve. In the Midland Basin, our performance was very good this quarter and production is on track despite some changes to our pad completion schedule to accommodate frac operations on offsetting leases. We operated an average of six rigs during the quarter and brought online a six-well pad. The production impact from our increased rig count will be more fully reflected through the remainder of the year as we complete and flow back multiple pads. Two years of well cost improvement initiatives are clearly evident. On our recent Connell 47 and Connell 48 pads, we drilled a total of 12, one-mile laterals at an average completed well cost of approximately $4.6 million. Tim Sullivan will provide more details on our Midland Basin well results and future activity plans. We have a large position in the core of the Midland Basin, and I look forward to this area contributing returns-focused growth for a long time. Now, let me turn to Alpine High. We announced our discovery of Alpine High in an Investor Conference eight months ago. At that time, we described the extensive geologic and seismic analysis used to discover the play and the detailed reservoir evaluation we had initiated to characterize the potential of this massive hydrocarbon system. As you all know, we have been delineating Alpine High with what we call test wells. Test wells are designed for the purpose of minimizing the cost of delineating the resource base and maximizing learnings. They demonstrate the potential of the rock, but do not represent the productive capacity of an optimized development well or pad. When we announced Alpine High, we released data on nine test wells. The results of these wells, coupled with the geologic and reservoir evaluation work completed at that time, confirmed a world-class unconventional resource with an estimated 75 Tcf of gas and 3 billion barrels of oil in place in the Woodford and Barnett formations alone. Resource estimates were confined to these two formations, because they had been the focus of the work to that point in time. The performance of our first batch of test wells at Alpine High was on par with or better than longer-lateral, fully-optimized wells and analogous shale resource plays, such as the SCOOP and the Marcellus. This has since been supported by an independent third-party in their review of EURs per well. Since our original announcement, we have continued to delineate the play. The test wells drilled to-date have proven much of what we anticipated for Alpine High, but this is a multi-dimensional hydrocarbon system with five distinct formations extending across a 60-mile fairway. The Woodford, Barnett, Pennsylvanian formations are a true unconventional shale sequence characterized by excellent reservoir quality, minimal to no in-situ water, strong EURs, low F&D costs, low operating costs, and high expected rates of return at current commodity prices. There are at least eight potential landing zones within the Woodford, Barnett, Pennsylvanian, four of which we have confirmed to-date. We've also confirmed that the entire source rock sequence is over-pressured and contains all three hydrocarbon phases: oil, wet gas and dry gas. And that the depth and temperature at which the source rock is encountered varies across Alpine High and determines the dominant hydrocarbon phase. And lastly, we've established that the Wolfcamp and Bone Springs formations are present oil bearing and perspective and significant portions of Alpine High. With the knowledge gained from our appraisal work, we are confidently building a comprehensive, long-term, full-field development plan. In parallel, we are constructing a large scale infrastructure system to ensure the ability to process and market the full stream of hydrocarbons and to optimize the value of Alpine High. We have already begun the transition from the test well program. The majority of our wells going forward will begin an optimization program that will entail longer-laterals, larger fracs with more stage density, vertical and horizontal spacing density, and lateral wellbore placement within highly targeted zones. This morning, in our Financial and Operational Supplement, we provided results on three new test wells. Two of these wells, the Chinook 101AH and the Blackhawk 5H were drilled to the Woodford and Barnett formations, respectively, in an area where the source rock sequence is quite shallow. These wells achieved higher 24-hour oil IP and higher oil cuts than any of the wells drilled, completed and disclosed (15:46) to-date. This further validates our geologic and thermal maturity models, which predicted that the source rock would produce more oil and higher BTU gas at shallower depths. The third well we announced today, the King Hidalgo 3H in the southern portion of Alpine High, was an offset to our previously disclosed 9H well. You may recall from the disclosure in February that we did not believe the 9H well was drilled on an optimal azimuth, as it was drilled before our 3-D was fully processed and interpreted. In the 3H well, we reoriented the lateral and more than doubled the IP rate of the 9H. Tim Sullivan will provide more detail on all three of these wells. I would just reiterate that these wells are still representative of our testing program. And while we believe they are economic as drilled, the rates do not represent the capability of optimized Alpine High development wells. You can expect future disclosure to contain well results with more optimized completions. To-date, we've drilled more than 40 wells at Alpine High. We currently have four wells producing and 22 wells shut-in or curtailed awaiting infrastructure. Additionally, there are a number of wells in flow back, completion or drilling. We look forward to bringing these wells online, optimizing liquids recovery and demonstrating their potential. I would now like to transition briefly to Alpine High infrastructure. Our midstream facility construction represents a strategically important investment and has proceeded extremely well. Delivery of the initial phase of the buildout was significantly ahead of schedule and under budget. We first broke ground on our infrastructure at Alpine High in November, and since that time have installed approximately 14 miles of 30-inch trunk line for gas delivery, 11 miles of gathering systems, five centralized processing facilities which are in various stages of completion, one water recycling facility, and 10 central tank batteries in various phases of construction. Initial gas sales began this week at a rate of around 20 million cubic feet of gas per day. This volume should ramp up to more than 50 million cubic feet of gas per day by the end of June. We're also making good progress on drilling operations at Alpine High as we continue to climb the learning curve. Tim will have more details on our recent well costs, and how that will change as we transition to more optimized wells in the future. Finally, we recently strengthened our organization on the midstream and marketing side. Last week, we announced the appointment of two highly experienced executives to the team. Both of these individuals bring a deep understanding of midstream and marketing activities in North America, broad business development experience, and extensive end user relationships to complement our team. These additions will significantly strengthen our commercial capabilities as we ramp up production at Alpine High and continue to evaluate future alternatives for the midstream business in Apache. To sum up Alpine High, this is a massive hydrocarbon resource and we believe we control the vast majority of it. A play of this size takes time to properly delineate and optimize, but our progress, since the initial announcement eight months ago, has been exceptional. To-date, we've confirmed a highly economic wet gas play with a minimum of 3,000 locations. The economics of the wet gas portion of Alpine High are greatly enhanced by its oil content and the high-quality NGLs demonstrated in many of our test wells to-date. As we complete our delineation, we believe the wet gas location count will rise significantly. And as we test shallower zones and geologic settings, we believe that oil locations will also be added. In closing, we hit the ground running in 2017, and we are delivering on the production, capital spending and LOE targets we established in February. We're pleased with the early start-up of Alpine High, our under-budget delivery of the midstream side, and the associated increase in production guidance. We look forward to providing further updates in the near future. I will now turn the call over to Tim to provide more operational details.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon. In my remarks today, I will highlight operational activity and key wells in our focus areas. I will also provide an update on service and supply costs, along with the actions we're taking to address inflation. Our first quarter results reflect the impact of reduced CapEx and development activity during 2016. These effects will linger into the second quarter of 2017. Then, we begin our shift to a growth trajectory that you will see in the third quarter and subsequent periods. We began expanding our drilling program in the Midland Basin beginning late in the fourth quarter, increasing from two rigs to the current count of six. These operations feature pad drilling, which can take longer to see production results than with the single well, but is a more efficient way to produce hydrocarbons and helps us preserve the lower cost structure we achieved last year. During the first quarter, North America production averaged 252,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 3% decline from the fourth quarter 2016. Most of this decline comes from lower volumes in the Midcontinent, Gulf of Mexico and Canada regions, where we limited investment. We continue to build momentum in the Permian Basin, where production of 148,000 Boe per day in the first quarter was nearly flat with 149,000 Boe reported for the preceding period. The Midland/Delaware basins contributed approximately 85,000 Boe per day to this total in the first quarter. The main highlight from the Midland Basin this quarter is the start-up of production from the six-well Connell 48 pad at Powell Field in Upton County. These wells have oil cuts of approximately 80% and have produced at very strong initial 30-day average rates 6x wine-rack spacing in two landing zones in the Wolfcamp B formation. The Connell 48 pad features mile-long laterals as we're conducting spacing tests on the pad. The flow rates on a per thousand foot basis are impressive. They are outlined in our first quarter Financial and Operational Supplement. Going forward, in the core of the Midland Basin, we expect two-thirds of our wells to have extended laterals of approximately 1.5 miles or longer. Following Connell 48, the rig moved to the Connell 47, a six-well pad where we'd be testing tighter 8x wine-rack spacing in two Wolfcamp B landing zones. We are in very early flow back on the Schrock 34 pad in the Azalea area on the border of Midland and Glasscock counties. This includes nine wells drilled with 6x wine-rack spacing in intervals of the Wolfcamp A1, B1 and B3 formations. Turning to Alpine High, included in our first quarter Financial and Operational Supplement are results from three recent test wells at Alpine High. The Chinook 101AH produced at a peak 24-hour rate of approximately 8.5 million cubic feet of rich 1,300 BTU gas and 620 barrels of oil. At a depth of 10,100 feet, the Chinook is our shallowest Woodford test to-date. This is an excellent result, particularly when considering that it is an unoptimized test well with a 4,500 foot lateral and a smaller standardized frac. The Blackhawk 5H was completed at a depth of 9,760 feet and is our shallowest Barnett well disclosed to-date. This well produced at a peak 24-hour rate of 742 barrels of oil and 5.3 million cubic feet of rich 1,300 BTU gas. Like the Chinook, this was an unoptimized test well. Moving to the southern end of Alpine High, we drilled the third well disclosed this morning, King Hidalgo 3H in the Woodford formation. This was an azimuth test well offset to the previously disclosed King Hidalgo 9H well. The 3H, at a depth of 13,000 feet, recorded a 24-hour peak rate of 7 million cubic feet of 1,200 BTU gas and 72 barrels of oil. The much stronger performance of the 3H proves that azimuth is critical in optimizing flow rates. Because our initial test wells have been quite deep in the Hidalgo area, we didn't expect to encounter a cooler temperature regime. This enabled liquids production and indicates that there will be significant amount of up-hole zone with potential for higher liquid cuts. For comparison, recall that we encountered dry gas in the Redwood unit at a similar depth in the northern portion of Alpine High. The cost story at Alpine High is also very positive. We recently drilled a pacesetter well with a 4,600 foot lateral in just 13 days, from spud to TD, at a cost of approximately $2 million. Regardless of the ultimate completion size and technique, all-in costs for this type of a well should fall comfortably in our targeted range of $4 million to $6 million. The result we see in our test wells at Alpine High continue to give us confidence that this will be one of the lowest cost, wet gas plays in North America. We look forward to demonstrating this later in the year with optimized drilling results. I will turn now to our international assets. Adjusted production in Egypt declined approximately 2% from the fourth quarter 2016 to 88,000 Boe per day. We drilled 18 wells in Egypt during the first quarter with a 72% success rate. Highlights from this program include development wells at Berenice 6 in the Faghur Basin with a 30-day average IP of nearly 3,760 Boe per day; the Phiops 11, which achieved a peak rate exceeding 3,400 Boe per day in the Shushan Basin; the Ptah 7, which achieved a peak rate of more than 3,330 Boe per day in the Faghur Basin; and the Herunefer 3, which achieved a peak rate of more than 3,100 Boe per day in the Matruh Basin. In the North Sea, our production declined to 58,000 Boe per day as operations were impacted by a mechanical issue on the Beryl Alpha platform during the quarter. We also experienced some underperformance on a few gas-prone wells in the Beryl area. Oil volumes were generally in line with expectations. Progress on the Khalda Development continues on schedule for start-up in the third quarter. We have moved up our North Sea facilities' annual turnaround activity to accommodate hookup and commissioning with the new subsea tieback. While this turnaround and facility work will impact second quarter production, it should help reduce overall planned downtime at Beryl for the year. Please refer to our Financial and Operational Supplement for more details on our first quarter production. I'll move now to service costs. We continue to see pricing pressure for certain services and supplies, which we planned for in our 2017 capital budget. Cost escalation is most apparent for pressure pumping, premium drilling rigs, and sand in the Permian Basin. Anticipating this, we implemented a number of strategies to keep our cost structure low and minimize the impact of inflationary pricing. This includes leveraging our size as one of the most active drillers to achieve volume discounts, and we've also unbundled services. We're working with a wider assortment of vendors who want to work with Apache as we can provide a more continuous, steady program than other operators with smaller footprints. We have also signed agreements for pressure pumping services and sand that index prices to WTI, providing a win-win outcome for us and our vendors as commodity prices improve. In these agreements, we have seen very little cost increases thus far. On the sand side, we're self-sourcing product by buying almost exclusively native sand, mined close to the operations. Our test indicates that we are achieving effective results with this product, and it significantly reduces our transportation costs. Vendor competition is good for Apache and healthy for the industry. We found that we can achieve good results safely and economically, sourcing more work to new and different providers. I will conclude by noting that we are pleased to be increasing activity in North America at a measured pace with the focus on generating strong fully burdened returns. As indicated by our guidance, growth will follow in the second half of 2017. Despite industry cost pressures, we believe our 2017 North America operations will be more productive and capital efficient than in previous years. I will now turn the call over to Steve.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I will review our financial results for the first quarter, update a few 2017 guidance items, and discuss Alpine High midstream and marketing activities. Beginning with the first quarter financial results, as noted in our press release, Apache reported net income of $213 million or $0.56 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates. These items include a $222 million gain on sale after taxes for the recent non-core asset divestitures John mentioned earlier. When excluding this gain and other smaller items, our adjusted earnings for the quarter were $31 million or $0.08 per share. Note, this adjusted earnings amount still includes dry hole costs which amounted to $40 million or $0.10 per share after tax, which Apache does not include in its guidance and is not typically modeled by analysts. Cash flow from operations in the first quarter was $455 million. Before working capital changes, Apache generated $730 million in cash flow. The significant working capital used this quarter is primarily related to the payment of expenses accrued at year-end 2016. With the proceeds received from non-core asset sales, we increased our cash position to $1.5 billion at quarter-end and reduced net debt to just under $7 billion. Our Oil and Gas capital investment for the quarter was $646 million. This was below our expectations due to capital activity being delivered under budget, as well as movements in the timing of certain spending to later in the year. For reasons outlined by John, our full year capital investment guidance remains unchanged at $3.1 billion. Turning to costs, lease operating expenses in the first quarter were $7.76 per barrel of oil equivalent, approximately 8% lower than the fourth quarter of 2016. We made tremendous progress on LOE over the last two years, and we are focused on retaining as much of that improvement as possible despite inflationary pressures. These efforts, combined with increasing low-cost Alpine High volumes, are bringing LOE expectations down. As a result, we are revising our full-year 2017 guidance range for LOE per Boe down to $8.25 to $8.75 per barrel of oil equivalent. Lastly, exploration expense in the first quarter was $92 million. $67 million of this was attributable to dry hole expense and small amounts of unproved leasehold impairments. For the full-year 2017, we previously guided to $150 million of exploration expense excluding dry holes and unproved impairments. This guidance remains unchanged. For all other expense items, our first quarter and full year results are generally on track; and thus, our full-year 2017 guidance is unchanged. Please reference the quarterly supplement for a summary of our guidance. Next, let me turn our midstream and marketing activities at Alpine High. On the midstream side, we are well into a multi-year infrastructure buildout to serve the long-term needs of Alpine High. While there are significant industry infrastructure around the Permian Basin, Alpine High requires extensive in-field processing capacity and transport to market access. Last year, our early testing demonstrated the enormous resource potential of Alpine High. As plans for full-field development materialized, we made the decision to build the infrastructure ourselves. It is strategically important to control the scope and pace of the buildout, and we are confident we have the capability to manage a project of this scale. The start-up of gas processing this week ahead of schedule and under budget reinforces that confidence. Looking ahead at our future infrastructure buildout plans, a high-pressure gas trunk line system, through our acreage, should be mostly complete by the end of 2018. We will have a 30-inch line that connects to three market pipelines to the north, and a 30-inch line that connects to one market pipeline to the south. To accommodate longer-term volume growth, completion of the third line, running from Alpine High to the Waha Hub, is anticipated during 2019. The size of this line has yet to be determined. Ultimately, Alpine High gas will have access to multiple markets, providing significant optionality for gas flow in the future. The remaining infrastructure, including gathering lines, separation, treating, compression and processing facilities will be built out over time as the pace of upstream development dictates. In the longer term, we will explore the option of installing cryogenic gas processing to extract more NGLs. In terms of liquids infrastructure, oil and NGLs are currently being trucked, which will continue for the near term. We anticipate the completion of an NGL pipeline, the size of which has yet to be determined, during 2019. We are evaluating options for the NGL line to extend beyond the Waha Hub to access further market optionality. Finally, there are many options for oil pipeline access, and we are exploring those for future consideration. As we look further into the future, the need to continue owning the Alpine High infrastructure assets should become less important. We see the possibility of a partial or full monetization and are planning accordingly. In the near term, we are confident this infrastructure project is a compelling investment, both strategically and financially, as these types of assets are generally monetized at very attractive multiples. On the gas marketing side, we are advancing discussions on many fronts and have begun implementing a contracting strategy. At this point, we have contractual assurance for the sale of most of our Alpine High gas for 2017, and have begun to contract for 2018. We are developing a portfolio of market solutions for Alpine High gas production. This will include targeting end users across a wide variety of industrial users, such as petrochemical complexes, utilities, and L&G exporters. It will also include access to gas markets that can deliver higher net backs. Specifically, this will require the ability to move gas away from the Waha Hub to places such as the Texas Gulf Coast and Mexico. Today, we are receiving a Waha base price for our natural gas. Since Apache announced the Alpine High discovery, more than 10 pipeline projects have been proposed and/or under review to expand takeaway capacity out of the Permian Basin. We expect at least two of these pipelines will be constructed with estimated in-service dates of mid-2019 to early 2020. While there has been some recent volatility in widening in the Waha base's differentials, additional transportation capacity to the Texas Gulf Coast should help alleviate the situation. In closing, it was a good first quarter for Apache financially, and we are demonstrating excellent capital cost and operating cost discipline. We've made great progress with our planning and execution on the midstream and marketing side at Alpine High, and I look forward to future updates. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions and answers.
Operator: Our first question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein.
Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Alpine High gas takeaway, is that connected to all of the pads or is it focused on some of those pads in the north? How much of those pads can access that market right now?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Bob, good afternoon. Right now, the first connections have been to the north. We've got one central processing facility up there that's up and running. So we've got just a handful of wells that we're bringing on initially. We're significantly ahead of schedule. And so, we've started in the north, but it will expand pretty quickly.
Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So that 50 million cubic feet a day by end of June is coming from a handful of wells?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It will be a pretty small number. I mean, actually, right now, we're curtailed by what we nominated. We are flowing close to 20 million cubic feet a day and we'll ramp pretty quickly to the 50 million cubic feet.
Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.
Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: A question on Alpine High and balance sheet. So, again, congratulations on the work you're doing there. You talk often about stages per well, longer laterals and optimizing liquids recovery. I mean, the longer lateral math is pretty easy to understand in other plays. But maybe just some color in terms of where you are in terms of current stages and where you think you will get to? And then, what yield uplift you think you might be able to get as you optimize the equipment on the liquids?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Ed, we've taken, as you know, a very disciplined approach and all of our wells have been specifically designed to kind of mirror each other in terms of the completion. So they've been, what we call, test wells. They've had relatively strong small fracs, very few stages. And we've done that purposefully, so that with the changes we can see what the rock was telling us, not as you start getting real fancy on your completion. So the nice thing is, we said earlier, this year we were transitioning. And by getting the infrastructure on it, it lets us flow gas early and start to sell some liquids as well. But more importantly now, we're not going to be limited by flaring and other things. So we've transitioned. As we start to bring some of those wells on and start to disclose some of those rates, we'll start to give some of the comparisons. But we expect a pretty material uptick from what we've been using as our standard completion.
Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And then, just on the balance sheet. I mean, obviously the whole sector's down, oil is down. Therefore, we don't have a real view on the commodity, but you've still got $1.5 billion of cash. You've spoken about capital flexibility, but also perhaps disposals, maybe just what is the rainy day plan?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean, if you look at what we did this year, we (41:04) for the back half of the year to protect us at $50, which is our plan. So we feel really good about this year's capital program because we've got a lot more exposure to oil price than we do gas price. We do have $1.5 billion of cash on hand. We sold $440 million of predominantly non-producing acreage, some things that we weren't going to get to for a long time, probably five, six years, if ever. And so, that's helped us. I think the big thing is, is we've taken a very measured approach. I mean, we've got a very robust inventory and our guys are chomping it a bit to do more on the capital side, but we've just taken a pretty measured approach. We want to be focused on the cost side, focused on the discipline and ramp up slowly, which is kind of the approach we've taken. So we feel good about where we sit right now with where commodity prices are. Again, there are some other things we can do as we continue to look at the portfolio, but we feel really good about where the balance sheet is. I don't know, if you want to add anything, Steve? Okay.
Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good afternoon.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Hello.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: A couple of questions on Alpine High. The first is, you've talked about that comprehensive development plan. Can you give us a little bit more color on what that looks like? Specifically, if it includes the Wolfcamp and Bone Springs zones? And then, what the milestones are in those zones to get from today to developing more oilier areas?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: The thing I would say, Brian, is it's a live product for us. As we continue to get more data, it becomes more expansive. The best thing I would say is, look to the guidance. If you go back to the start of the year, we gave you Midland and Delaware and we gave you a look through the fourth quarter of 2018. And, obviously, we've got a lot of wells that we're drilling. We drilled over 40 wells. With the three we announced today, we've now disclosed I think 19 results. And we're starting to bring some of those on, and we've got a lot of wells that are in the queue. They're either flowing back now, shut-in and waiting to be produced, being completed, or drilling. So I think it's going to be an exciting next couple quarters for us as we bring forward a lot more information. But we are very optimistic, as we stated, about the parasequences, the Wolfcamp and the Bone Springs. We've done a lot of integrated work on the geology, the modeling, integrating 3-D seismic; done a lot of work. And I think we've done our homework and we've got some exciting appraisal wells that are in progress.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. And then, if we look back on some of the older Alpine High wells, what are you seeing on the decline rate side? And because some of these wells are constrained, would we expect a lower decline rate than the decline rate that we would see in the development plan?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Brian, most of the wells that – after we've kind of stabilized test rates on them, we shut most of the wells in. So we have not been producing those. I mean, when you're flaring gas without the ability to sell the gas, then you'd be paying royalty that did not make sense. So we shut most of those wells in. And, obviously, this week we've started to open some wells back up. So we're very anxious to produce. I can tell you, the early responses look really good. A lot of flush liquids and some exciting stuff.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.
Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon. On the Chinook and the Blackhawk wells that had the oil condensate rates, can you give us a little color in terms of the gravity of the oil? Did that fall in line with your expectations or was that a little bit higher than anticipated?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: No. Well, first of all, Scott, it's oil; it's not a condensate. It's very stable. And, yes, it fell in line with our models. So no surprises. The gas BTU content gets heavier as we move up and the oil gravities are getting lower as well, which is a really positive sign. I think one of the keys for us will be getting things into the processing facilities. When you're catching (45:45) on those, it's hard sometimes and there is room for error within those test samples. But everything really, really fits our maturity model and our geologic models very tightly. So we're very excited about the predictability in the transgressive source intervals.
Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And, outside of the test rate, were you able to flow those wells a little bit or are those shut-in like you mentioned due to the infrastructure constraints?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: No, those wells have been flowing over the last several days. And so, we have been flowing those wells. And, quite frankly, we will be able to move the into facilities pretty early this quarter.
Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Any color on some of the productivity, post the initial test rates?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: No, it looked good. I mean, we're very excited about it. So one of the keys is, we need to get the facilities, get everything tied in and run them through properly, because then we can really start to dial down in what these things are going to do. But we're very encouraged, and it was predictable to see as we moved up the column with the lower temperature. We knew they were going to get more oily, which is the case. And there's a lot of real estate above us and a lot of other zones to test as well. So, I mean, it's very exciting.
Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And if I could just quickly on the gas sales contracts. I think you all said that you had most or all of 2017 locked up and looking at 2018. Who are you signing up the contracts with for 2017? What type of end users, not maybe specifically, but if you can generalize that for us.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yes. No, we're not at this point disclosing exactly who we're contracting with, but there are lots of player in that area. So you can count on the fact that we're – as I said in my script, we're looking to have a pretty good size portfolio of various solutions on the contracting side, both in terms of transporting product, as well as marketing it to various forms of users. And we do have contractual assurance, as I said, for the vast majority of our volume for 2017, as much as we think we can be capable of producing this year. And part of that contract goes into – or part of the contracting that we've done so far goes into 2018 as well.
Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of John Herrlin with Soc Gen.
John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale: Thank you. With respect to the cryogenic units at Alpine High, can you give us a sense of how big you're contemplating? Or you're going to do skid units or you're going to do some large centralized units?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yes. John, it's early. We've got some time. I mean, it's really an option for us. So as we start to pull the processing facilities, get them all up and running, that's one of the things we've got tabled to make a decision on. Really, we could pull the trigger on it at any time, but we will look at what's optimal. I mean, the nice thing about this resource play is we've got a wide range from pretty much dry gas in some areas up to the north, to very, very wet gas. So I don't envision it being an all-or-nothing decision on the cryo, and it's just one of the things we've got tabled to do later.
John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale: Okay. That's fair. And then, in terms of monetizing this down the line, I would assume that this is several years out because you want to control your growth right now of the infrastructure in terms of going in a healthy route or whatever?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: I mean, I think if you look at what some of the transactions that have been recently done out there, they're significant value. I mean, I think clearly right now as we're ramping up, now would not be the time. But I think as you get out past a year from now, you could easily be in a window where you could consider doing something. I don't know, Steve, if you want to add anything further?
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yes. John, I think ultimately the answer to that is going to be both a strategic answer and a financial answer. I think John is exactly right. By the time we get into – well, into 2018 financially, we'd certainly be capable of monetizing this at a pretty attractive price. And then, it'll come down to the question of strategically is it the right time. And you're exactly right, there's – as I said in my comments, it's strategically important for us to control this at this point in time and the ability to start it up two months early and the flexibility that we have around constructing. It's a pretty sizable project. It's proven to be pretty important that we had complete control over that. So we'll continue to monitor that both strategically and financially, and combined, we'll make the decision as to when and if we monetize it.
John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale: Okay, great. Thanks, Steve. One last one for me. Do you have any sense of the notional value of what your hedges are right now for the oil?
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: I haven't looked at them today, but they're probably worth more today than they were last week.
John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale: Okay. That's fair. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Phillip Jungwirth with BMO.
Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good afternoon.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Hello.
Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States): We're starting to see industry activity, whether it's permits or rigs, into Jeff Davis County. And I know this isn't an area where you guys lease. But curious as to your view on how the play changes as you move west of your position? And why this wasn't an area that, had you focused on when you initially built this position?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean, what I would say, Phillip is, is obviously since we put the play together grassroots, did a lot of work upfront, went out and leased what we felt like we wanted, shot a massive 3-D over the entire area. I think we like our position. As I said in our comments, we think we've leased the lion's share of the Alpine High. So, clearly, there's a lot of other targets and a lot of things, and you see a lot of activity picking up around us. But we like where we are and consciously leased what we wanted to lease.
Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, great. And then, in Suriname, just curious as to your thoughts on farming down some of your 100% interest in Block 58. And then, given that dry hole costs in this area are relatively inexpensive, how would that factor into your consideration?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: The Kolibrie well was a well we needed to drill. We've learned a lot about the basin from that well and gained some very, very valuable information. Right now, I am also glad that we drilled that well with, what I'll call, 45-cent dollars as we had a 45% interest in it. And our dry hole cost was significantly lower. It came in around $20 million versus a budgeted number of around $37 million, so relatively much cheaper. What I would say is, is we're working on next steps at Block 53. We've got time on Block 58. We've shot the 3-D, we're processing it, we'll have that done sometime this year. We're very encouraged by what we see on Block 58, and we'll just leave that for another date.
Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Arun Jayaram from JPM. Challenge...
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Hey, Arun.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC: How are you doing?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Good.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I was wondering if you could help us think about, on a go-forward basis, what the cost structure is going to look like at Alpine? I am just trying to think, your cash flow per Mcfe kind of margins, as you start getting into 2018 and start to dial the volumes up. So can you help us think about the cost structure for Alpine High?
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yes, Arun. This is Steve. I think the best place to go and get that would be in our Barclays pack that we used, the slide deck that we used. Go to that one slide on economics. I think from there you can get the cost per barrel. It's in the fine print on that slide, but be sure you add $500,000 per well for infrastructure costs, because it's included in the economics that we ran, but not included in the well costs that we published on that day. It does give you the $4 million to $6 million per well on the high-end and low-end. Add $500,000 to that, you've got estimated EURs and, therefore, you'll have estimated production mix from that. Today, we're selling oil basically at WTI. We are selling NGLs at about – we've been selling it anywhere from 45% to 50% of WTI. And you could probably use Waha Hub as pricing for the gas. So you'll get a mixed price per barrel equivalent. And I think you can use your typical gas field type of cash costs on the operating side. And I think when you do that, you're going to find a pretty darn attractive ratio of the cost per barrel to cash margin per barrel. That would probably compete with anything you're doing on a more oily basis in the rest of the Permian Basin. You'll see from that why we're so excited about the economics of this wet gas play.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. But maybe details on – your thoughts on the LOE versus the GPT on Alpine High?
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: No. We're not really sharing any of that right now. But I think you can count on the fact that the LOE per Boe is going to be low, especially for the next several years, as we drill some fresh wells, get some flush production going. And it's going to be, I think, a typical LOE on a robust gas field.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Fair enough.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: One of the pluses, Arun, is you don't have a lot of water in the lower source intervals, which is all we've talked about in the economics. So we're not going to have the water handling challenges that you have in northern parts of the basin. Now, if we start to bring forward some of the parasequences, there may be some more water with some of those. And so, that's one of the reasons why we'll bring some of that data forward in the future.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Fair enough. And just switching gears a little bit, in terms of the new concessions in Egypt, at what point, John, do you think you'll be able to drill some wells on these new concession areas?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, we expect those to be awarded some time pretty quick, this month or next month most likely. I think we could be actively planning to drill this fall, is the plan. So we're very, very excited about those concessions. A big uptick. We have not got two new onshore concessions in the Western Desert since 2006. And we see a lot of low-hanging fruit and a lot of really neat stuff to go after. So we're chopping it a bit to get our hands on those concessions. We're going to do a lot for our Egypt inventory.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right. Thanks a lot.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Bob Morris with Citi.
Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. John, it wasn't clear on the processing or the handling of the NGLs, when you would have that processing capacity in place to begin moving and selling NGLs. And if you're initially going to be installing cryogenic plants or just going with cheaper lean oil plants to start with on that?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: We will have refridge in the processing facilities. We've got one up, it's up and running now, that we are working through, kind of lining it out. So we will be selling NGLs. Have been selling some off to some of these skid-mounted units we've had in the field as well. So, as Steve said, we've kind of been receiving anywhere from 45% to 50% of WTI for those NGLs. And, right now, our plans are for refridge in the field. And with the decision to be made on cryo, as I said, when Mr. Herrlin asked the question, later this year, early next year, sometime in the future on the cryo decision.
Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.: Good afternoon, John, to you and the rest of your team there. I wanted to ask a question about the Hidalgo pad, the King Hidalgo pad, and the uplift you guys saw on the 3H versus 9H. As I adjust for lateral length there, it looks like there's an uplift of about 60% just from adjusting your azimuth. And I am curious, is that indicative of the uplift you think is available through most of Alpine High by optimizing your azimuth? Or is there more something visible particularly to this area that made the azimuth more important down here?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, what I would say, Charles, is targeting is always critical in the productivity side, especially when you have rock like this. I mean, we've got a very provable area down there. We knew the azimuth, because we spud that well. We had done some before we had gotten our 3-D processed and really worked through it. So we knew it was on the wrong azimuth. We disclosed that back in February when we disclosed it, and we knew it would make an impact. So it is one of the key things. And when we talk about – even mentioned it in the press release today – when we talk about moving into more optimization, that's one of the things we're going to be doing, too, is tweaking the targeting. And it matters a lot. And getting things on the right azimuth, that's one of the big pluses to having such a blockey acreage position because we can do this the right way, not trying to drill down lease lines and so forth, like you do in a lot of other plays.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.: Got it. So is the stress field pretty tricky across the whole play, or is it more just kind of – as you get more structurally complex that it becomes an issue?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It will change based on the geologic setting and it changes within the setting. So it's one of the things that you have to do a lot of integrative work to fully understand, like anything else. But the 3-D is pretty helpful to understanding that and seeing what some of the substructure is doing, is pretty key to understanding that.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.: Right, right. And then one last quick one. The pace of your divestitures, how are you thinking about that? Is that something that we should expect an ongoing kind of steady pace on that? Or is that more opportunistically driven in that case may be attached to oil prices?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: No, I mean, it's more opportunistically driven. We continue to look at our portfolio. As we build out more optionality and more inventory, there are things that we look at today that in the past we might have thought we would've funded that we won't get to. And so, we don't have anything set out there that we're saying here's what's going to be next. But I'll just say we're actively looking at our portfolio and managing it, and it would be more opportunistically in terms of what we decide to put out there.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.: That's great detail. Thanks, John.
Operator: And our last question comes from line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. David, your line is open.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you. I was on mute. A couple of questions, John. North Sea, can you just talk about the production? I think there were some outages, but can you talk about the production quarter-to-quarter and what happened there?
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yes, David. In January, we had an upset at Beryl Alpha and the whole platform went down. We lost about 18 million cubic feet a day for the month of January. And then, we drilled a couple of non-commercial wells, and then we had a couple of wells that under-performed in the first quarter and that's what's causing our issue. But keep in mind we've got a calendar coming online start of the third quarter. We're very excited about that. And then, we had really a tremendous quarter in Egypt with a lot of successes not only in our development program, but in our exploration program. Got 13 wells online there and we've got a number of wells that will be coming online in the second quarter. So as a result of all that, we did not have to do anything with our guidance. We left guidance unchanged for international.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And Alpine High has been (01:03:56). John, so just a comment you made about service contracts, I don't know if that was you or Steve that made the comment, but about linking those to WTI. What percentage would you say – is it something that you envision going meaningfully higher like structural change and the way prices are set going forward? Or is this just kind of a one-off? Or how should we think about this in the big picture context?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: No, I mean, I think there's an opportunity in some cases to turn it from a win-lose into a win-win. And we've sat down and had some pretty grownup conversations with some of our bigger service providers that do a lot of different things for us and have tried to find ways where you tie things more to the oil price rise, where both sides are happy than you are directly with demand. Because, as you know, as we saw in late-2014 and demand can oftentimes outrun the rise in terms of what the commodity price is doing. So I think we're trying to do some things more in a way that's going to create a win-win or we can put some equipment and crews in place and let them work for a long, long time for both companies and be happy with it.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right. Thanks. That's all I've got.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: That is all the time we have for questions today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Clark for closing remarks.
Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us on a busy earnings day. There were number of analysts left on the queue. So if we didn't get to your question, please feel free to call myself, Patrick or Kian, and we'd be happy to follow up with you. Talk to you all next quarter. Thanks.

Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's fourth quarter and full-year of 2016 financial and operational results conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; Executive Vice President of Operations Support, Tim Sullivan; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Steve Riney. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our fourth quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. I would like to note that the supplement posted this morning includes expanded production and financial guidance for 2017. Production numbers cited in today's call have been adjusted to exclude our non-controlling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Please also note that we are now providing guidance for our Egypt-based operations that includes non-controlling interest and tax barrels such that analysts can reconcile their estimates to Apache's reported production numbers. I would also call your attention to the updated production guidance we are providing for North America. We are now providing specific production guidance for the Midland and Delaware Basins, combined which represents Apache's primary growth engines. Another minor change we have made for 2017 is that we are now including the Gulf of Mexico in our North American guidance. We're also providing more comprehensive capital guidance, which now includes all oil and gas capital investment, leasehold acquisition, capitalized interest and capitalized G&A, and we are continuing to exclude Egypt non-controlling interest capital from our guidance. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking statements and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. I will now turn the call over to John.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will review our 2016 accomplishments, outline our 2017 strategic and operational objectives, discuss our capital spending plans and production outlook for the next two years, and I will conclude with an update of our Alpine High play. First, I'd like to step back and take stock of the last two years and how we have repositioned Apache. The collapse in commodity prices which began in 2014 required a strategic response to improve the company's financial standing and our operational capabilities and to position Apache to thrive as prices recovered. We have accomplished all that and more. The cornerstone of our approach has been strict capital discipline and cost structure rationalization, both of which have significantly improved the quality and economics of our underlying inventory as well as our ability to access and exploit its value for the future. We accomplished this through a rigorous and more centralized process for capital allocation, a more detailed long-term planning process, and through significant cost reductions in our operations and in our overhead structure. For example, we significantly reduced activity Onshore North America where costs were not aligned with lower commodity prices, dropping from 91 rigs in the third quarter of 2014 to eight rigs at year-end 2016. And since 2014, we drove down average onshore well costs by 30% to 40% across key plays in North America. Our LOE per BOE is down 24% and we have reduced our gross overhead cost structure by more than $300 million. As a result of these efforts, we were able to preserve our dividend, avoid issuing equity and maintain our investment-grade rating. We are now well prepared for a more constructive, albeit lower price environment, than prior to the downturn. With the proven quality of our Midland Basin acreage and the recent addition of the Alpine High in the Delaware Basin, we have an inventory capable of delivering robust organic growth for many years. Though some commodity price softness may continue, we are comfortable increasing our capital investment, which will leverage the quality of our inventory and the progress we have made on costs over the last two years. Now let me recount some of our key 2016 accomplishments. This was an exceptional year for Apache and another step forward in the positive transformation of the company. We exceeded our original production target, significantly lowered our cost structure and discovered an enormous new resource play in the Delaware Basin at Alpine High. Our operational improvements and exploration successes have positioned the company to deliver returns-focused growth for many years to come. On this call last year, I outlined a series of strategic and operational objectives designed to guide the company through a potentially lower-for-longer commodity price environment. We delivered on all of them. Most notably, we focused our North American capital on strategic testing and completion optimization, and in doing so, significantly expanded our economic drilling inventory and demonstrated our ability to deliver well results better than offset operators. We worked to streamline our North American portfolio through new acreage leasing, trades, and sales. We now have a more concentrated and contiguous position in the Permian Basin. We continued to drive cost efficiencies throughout the organization and achieved a 16% reduction in LOE per BOE from 2015 and we began the year with a conservative budget, which enabled us to increase activity levels late in the year as commodity prices improved. All of these efforts were necessary to position Apache for a strengthening commodity price environment. Our long-term focus has consistently been on delivering fully burdened returns-focused growth. In the lower commodity price environment, allocating capital toward our free cash flow positive assets in the UK, North Sea and Egypt while investing in exploration was the optimal use of our capital. As commodity prices strengthened, deploying a greater proportion of our capital into developing our world-class Onshore North American assets, is better. Our objective going forward will be to deliver returns-focused growth and our plan to support this objective includes: budgeting conservatively and maintaining flexibility to accelerate activity, if warranted; continuing our focus on costs and well optimization to maintain the structural efficiencies achieved over the last two years; increasing capital allocation to the Midland and Delaware Basins, where we have an extensive high quality inventory; initiating an optimized development program at Alpine High; investing to sustain long-term free cash flow generation from Egypt and the North Sea; and, finally, actively managing our portfolio and redeploying capital to higher-value opportunities. Now I'll turn to the 2017-2018 capital budget. Our capital budget for this year is $3.1 billion, which is up more than 60% from 2016. Our 2017 plan assumes $50 per barrel WTI, $51 per barrel for Brent index crude, $3.15 per Mcf for NYMEX natural gas, and $5.25 per Mcf for UK indexed gas. At these price levels, our capital program will exceed anticipated operating cash flow. The gap will be covered by proceeds from non-core asset sales, $400 million of which has already occurred, and a realization of prices at the current strip. We have also put in place some oil price hedges to protect against downside price movements. Steve will cover these in more detail. Our 2017 capital plan allocates nearly two-thirds or $2 billion to the Permian Basin. Of this amount, 90% will be directed to the Midland and Delaware Basins. This includes approximately $500 million for infrastructure construction at Alpine High, which will fund multiple pipeline connections along with the necessary compression, gathering, centralized processing facilities and tank batteries that will more than accommodate our planned volume ramp. Internationally, we will invest to sustain long-term free cash flow generation in Egypt and the North Sea. Total international spending represents approximately $900 million or 29% of our 2017 budget, split fairly evenly between Egypt and the North Sea. We have also included $37 million for an exploration well in Suriname, which we expect to spud next week. Outside of Suriname, our 2017 international opportunity set is primarily focused on development drilling and lower risk step-out exploration, where we have a long-standing track record of success. We are particularly excited about two exploration concessions that we recently received in the Western Desert of Egypt, our first award there in over 10 years. Should commodity prices further improve during the year and cash flows allow, incremental capital will be allocated primarily to the Midland and Delaware Basins. Turning briefly to 2018, our preliminary capital outlook is for $3.2 billion in investment. This program is supported by anticipated volume growth and higher plan prices for 2018. Like 2017, our 2018 plan will be heavily weighted toward Permian investment. Our 2017 and 2018 plan capital program will initiate a significant and prolonged production growth ramp. I would note specifically the magnitude of our anticipated production growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins. To assist in the production outlook discussion, we have provided a series of slides on pages 22 to 26 in our financial and operational review issued this morning with our earnings results. This includes a production forecast through the end of 2018. While our capital program has increased to reflect the objective of delivering long-term returns-focused growth, our production response will have a brief lag before transitioning to a strong growth trajectory. We anticipate total production will decline to approximately 372,000 BOEs to 384,000 BOEs per day in the second quarter of 2017. This will be a result of three primary drivers. In preparation for the start-up of our Callater discovery in the third quarter of 2017, we have accelerated our annual North Sea maintenance turnarounds into the second quarter. These turnarounds would typically occur later in the year. We have significant gas plant maintenance downtime scheduled in Canada for the second quarter of 2017 and investment in our lowest-margin North American assets was severely curtailed over the last two years and these assets are currently in decline. Importantly, none of this projected decline is in our higher-margin Midland Basin production, despite very low activity levels last year. In the second half of the year, the North Sea should rebound sharply with the start-up of Callater. More notably, North America will begin a rapid and relatively consistent quarterly growth ramp, which should continue through the end of 2018 and beyond. This will be driven primarily by the combination of accelerating oil production in the Midland Basin and the start-up of Alpine High in the Delaware Basin. Our projected oil growth in the Midland Basin is underpinned by the impressive performance we are seeing in our most recent vintage wells. Tim Sullivan will provide more detail on our Midland Basin wells in his remarks. At Alpine High, we anticipate having our first major sales line connection by July. Well connections and facilities commissioning will take place through the end of the year, accompanied by a material ramp in wet gas production. To put some numbers around our two-year growth profile, we expect total company production to increase by approximately 10% annually from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2018. Our Midland and Delaware Basin assets are projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 50% over the same time and drive the vast majority of Apache's overall production increase. Oil production growth in the Midland and Delaware will also be very strong with an annual growth rate of approximately 18%. We're very confident that Apache's portfolio can deliver on our production expectations through the end of 2018 and beyond. We are seeing outstanding drilling results in the Midland Basin and Alpine High continues to surprise us to the upside. With that, I will conclude with a brief update on the Alpine High play and review our next steps as we begin to phase in well optimization and fuel development activities. Since first announcing Alpine High last September, we have made tremendous progress delineating the play. We have confirmed several things thus far. We have an extensive play fairway, which spans 55 miles and a 5,000 foot vertical column encompassing five geologic formations, each with multiple targets. The hydrocarbon phase of this column ranges from dry gas to wet gas to oil. The entire Alpine High fairway is over-pressured with higher pressure gradients to the north and to the south. We have a second landing zone in the Woodford formation and most likely a third. We have productivity in the Pennsylvanian formation. And in the southern portion of the play, we have encountered the entire hydrocarbon column, improving productivity in the Woodford. With these results, we now believe that Alpine High's resource and location count has increased significantly since last September. And we haven't changed our view on well economics. We will provide updates to these numbers in the future. Importantly, we are beginning to optimize our wells using customized zone targeting, larger fracs and, in some cases, longer laterals. Combined with multi-well pad drilling we are confident this will demonstrate the economic value of the wet gas interval of Alpine High over the coming months. We continue to refer to Alpine High is a wet gas play, because that is what we have confirmed thus far. As we have previously noted, we are delineating from the bottom-up and this process is not yet complete. This is a prolific wet gas play from which we expect a minimum of 3,000 drillable locations. A significant enhancement to the economics of the source rock interval at Alpine High is the lack of water in the target formations. Once these wells produce the frac load, water production declined sharply, which results in significantly lower operating costs. Additionally, the field development program is not constrained by the need for extensive water handling infrastructure. As a result, even in the lower commodity price environment, this play is going to be very economic. Turning to midstream and marketing, our efforts at Alpine High are advancing quickly. Because the play lies in an area with very little existing infrastructure, it provides the unique opportunity to design a greenfield fit-for-purpose system that optimizes processing and transportation of our production and will service Alpine High for the full life of the field. For now, we own 100% of the midstream as it allows us to control the pace and scope of the build out. Alpine High is ideally situated with three major transportation lines located within 10 miles to the north and one major line to the south. The Waha hub which is located roughly 45 miles east of our acreage provides additional options for access to a wide range of domestic markets. Our location places us at the front of the line to deliver gas to Mexico as well as being advantageously positioned with LNG and petrochemical markets on the Texas Gulf Coast. Contract negotiations are well underway, and we see no near-term takeaway constraints as we prepare for first gas and the follow-on production ramp. On the marketing front, we have been inundated with interest for both our natural gas and NGLs. Potential customers are looking for certainty of supply, and the thick hydrocarbon bearing zones at Alpine High can provide it. In conclusion, Apache begins 2017 with an excellent opportunity set. Momentum will start to build around mid-year, with increased contribution from our pad drilling in the Midland Basin and the commencement of first residue gas sales at Alpine High. The Permian Basin will clearly be the driver of strong growth in the second half of 2017 through 2018 and well into the future. While commodity price volatility may not be completely behind us, we have come through the downturn with a very strong financial position and the ability to fund future growth through cash flow and portfolio high-grade. We continue to have no desire to add leverage or dilute our equity holders. Over the last two years, Apache demonstrated that we can play very good defense, and we now look forward to showing you our offense. With the plans, we have in place, we believe we will deliver highly competitive returns and top-tier Permian-driven growth. I will now turn the call over to Tim.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon. My remarks today will focus on 2016 production, expected activity in each of our regions during 2017, and a perspective on supply and service costs that we're seeing, particularly Onshore North America. Turning first to production; our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of reduced CapEx and development activity throughout 2016. During the fourth quarter, North America Onshore production averaged 252,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 7% decrease from the third quarter. Our Permian operations produced an average of 149,000 BOE per day, down 6% from the third quarter. As John noted, we expect overall North American production will continue to decline into the second quarter before shifting to a strong growth trend. Most of this decline will occur outside the Permian in regions where we have made relatively little capital investments over the past four quarters. In the North Sea, our production in the fourth quarter returned to more normalized levels at approximately 70,000 BOE per day, a 12% increase compared to the third quarter, which was impacted by extended facility turnaround issues. We are in initial planning stages for development of the store discovery that we announced on the last conference call. Our high-risk Canord (21:29) exploration well reached TD in the fourth quarter and did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. We have drilled three successful exploration wells and only one dry hole since acquiring our 3-D seismic survey over Beryl in 2013. Our gross production in Egypt during the fourth quarter declined approximately 2% on a sequential quarterly basis. On a net basis, excluding tax barrels and Sinopec's minority interest, production was approximately 90,000 BOE per day, a 7% decline from the third quarter, as higher realized prices resulted in Apache receiving fewer cost recovery barrels under our production, sharing and contract agreements. Please refer to our financial operational supplement for more details on our fourth quarter and full-year production. Turning to operations; last year, our focus on operational improvements and strategic testing established a solid foundation for achieving the company's 2017 goals. As a result, we are now drilling more productive wells more efficiently, and you will begin to see the impact of these improvements this year as we increase development activity primarily in the Delaware and Midland Basins. Our financial and operation supplement highlights some recent performance results from well optimization we implemented last year in the Midland Basin. This includes the use of improved targeting, drilling longer laterals, and more advanced completion designs. We have updated these cumulative curves with additional wells and more days on production since we first showed them in September. The bottom line is that we continue to see wells on our core acreage in the Midland Basin outperforming peers in the area. Apache concluded 2016 by adding three additional rigs in the Midland Basin, bringing our total rig count in the area up to five. We were at only one rig for most of 2016. These rigs are dedicated to long-term pad development drilling and our core acreage will enable us to place 25 wells on production during the first half of 2017. This is a significant increase from the nine Midland Basin wells placed on production in the second half of 2016 and will put the Midland Basin on a positive growth path. We are excited about moving forward with a multiyear, multi-rig drilling program that is designed to generate production from some of our best wells and our best rock. Most recently, our five-well Lynch pad at Wildfire came online last quarter with production from the Middle Spraberry, Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp B formations. This pad exhibited excellent 24-hour IPs, 30 day IPs and cumulative 60 day oil production. Our next pad at the Powell field is in early stages of flow back on six wells and began oil production last week. Following that, a nine-well pad at Azalea will go online in April. During 2017, we expect to average 15 rigs in the Permian Basin and drill approximately 250 wells. Our 2017 Permian Basin rig count comprises five rig lines and two frac crews in the Midland Basin. Three rigs drilling in the Delaware Basin outside of Alpine High, one rig on the Northwest Shelf drilling in the Yeso play and one vertical rig dedicated to improved recovery in the Central Basin Platform. In addition, we will have a four-rig to six-rig program at Alpine High. To accelerate well completions and data collection, we added a second frac crew at the start of this year. Elsewhere Onshore North America, in Oklahoma, we will run a targeted drilling program in the SCOOP/STACK play. We have a large inventory of locations in this play and total drilling costs have come down as we've improved our completion techniques. We expect to drill four wells in the MidContinent this year primarily for the purpose of holding acreage. In Canada, we plan to drill a total of 10-wells this year. In the first half of the year, we will drill out a six well pad in our Kaybob Duvernay play with production from those wells anticipated around mid-year following winter break up. We'll also drill three Montney 10 year wells in our Wapiti area in 2017. In the North Sea, we will operate an average of three rigs for the year, which includes two platform rigs and two semi-subs on rig sharing agreements. We plan to drill 15 wells to 16 wells this year. We've pulled forward our annual plant turnaround in the North Sea to accommodate first production at Callater. The net effect of this downtime and new production is that we expect the first half 2017 North Sea production of approximately 55,000 BOE per day and second half production at roughly 70,000 BOE per day. Our gross production in Egypt during 2017 is expected to be down slightly, about 2% from last year. This is primarily the result of an expected decrease in lower margin gas production as our large cost of field begins to decline. We will run eight rigs to 10 rigs during the year and drill 90 wells to 100 wells. The two new concessions awarded to Apache in November should be signed during the second quarter, and we plan to commence drilling operations in the fourth quarter. To support development on our existing acreage and the exploration on our new concessions, we will initiate a large continuous 3-D seismic survey program. This will take place over the coming months and provide newer vintage, high resolution imaging of the substrata across our Western Desert position, allowing us to build and high-grade our drilling inventory. Offshore Suriname, we are getting ready to spud the Kolibri #1 (27:24), an exploration well and Block 53, where Apache holds a 45% working interest. The rig is currently moving on to location and we expect to begin drilling next week, reaching targeted depth about 10 weeks later. With the move up in commodity prices and the subsequent increasing demand for drilling rigs, we are seeing an uptick in costs, particularly for certain services in North America Onshore, such as pressure pumping and sand. Our move to pad drilling operations in the Midland Basin brings efficiencies that will help offset some of these increases and protect some of the cost savings that we have captured over the past two years. We continue to look for ways to optimize our operations and improve our margins. This includes finding alternative sources and services to mitigate inflation and preserve well economics. We are finalizing contracts to secure fleets in West Texas with terms that include indexing prices to WTI and extending contracts with favorable rates. Our international operations have not seen the volatility in service costs as compared to North America Onshore. For example, service costs in Egypt remain very competitive and are among the lowest in the world. I'll conclude by noting that we have structured our capital allocation process and our operations to respond quickly as circumstances warrant. We are pleased to be back at work drilling more wells. As you can see from the recent data, we believe our 2017 North America development program will be more productive and capital efficient than in previous years. I will now turn the call over to Steve.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Tim. Today, I will highlight the company's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 financial performance. I will also outline our 2017 financial guidance and outlook. 2016 was a very successful year as we continued to progress a very important transformation of Apache Corporation. From a financial perspective, we re-based our capital investment programs to deliver competitive returns in a lower-for-longer price environment. We delivered on our overarching goal of cash flow neutrality, protecting the strength of our balance sheet and our liquidity. We maintained our investment-grade rating, and we delivered an exceptionally smooth transition to the successful efforts method of accounting. Many analysts and investors have noted Apache's conservative and disciplined approach. We remain grounded in the belief that a strong balance sheet, conservative planning and budgeting, and rigorous investment economics based on full-cycle, fully burdened returns deliver the greatest amount of long-term value for our shareholders. We are proud of this approach and it has served us well for the last two years. We have improved our financial position, strengthened our investment programs for the future. And, at the same time, we accessed and advanced a world-class discovery at Alpine High. Let me now review our full-year and fourth quarter 2016 results. As noted in our press release issued this morning, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported a loss of $182 million or $0.48 per share for the fourth quarter. These results include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates, the most significant of which were asset impairments. Adjusted for these items, the fourth quarter result was a loss of $22 million or $0.06 per share. Note this adjusted loss still includes dry hole costs, which amounted to $27 million or $0.07 per share after tax. For the full-year 2016, Apache reported a loss of $1.4 billion or $3.71 per share and an adjusted loss of $430 million or $1.13 per share. In the fourth quarter, Apache generated $819 million in net cash from continuing operating activities and $2.5 billion for the full-year. We maintained our strong liquidity position throughout 2016, ending the year with $1.4 billion cash on hand. Our net debt position at year-end 2016 was $7.2 billion, down slightly from year-end 2015. 2016 capital spending was $537 million for the fourth quarter and $1.9 billion for the full-year. Approximately $900 million of our investment during 2016 was directed to the Permian Basin, of which approximately $500 million was directed to Alpine High. We invested approximately $700 million in our international businesses, consistent with our strategy of investing to sustain the cash flow generating capacity of these assets for the long-term. Lease operating expense for the full-year averaged $7.85 per BOE, a 16% decrease from 2015. In the fourth quarter, lease operating expense was $8.39 per BOE, down 17% from the fourth quarter of 2015. For 2016, we set a gross overhead cash cost target of $650 million. Actual overhead costs for the year were $639 million. We reported expensed G&A of $410 million or $2.15 per BOE. During the fourth quarter of 2016, Apache entered into transactions to sell certain non-core assets. These included midstream assets in the North Sea and two mostly non-producing leasehold packages in the Midland and Delaware Basins. The net production impact from these sales is approximately 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day and is reflected in our 2017 production guidance, which John provided earlier. Now I will move on to our 2017 capital program and other financial guidance. As John outlined, we have a clear line of sight to closing the funding gap in our 2017 plan. While we believe that now is the time to outspend cash flows, we also want to protect our balance sheet. We have worked hard to build a strong financial position and we will not put that at risk to near-term price volatility. As such, we have put in place some protection against further price downside. Over the past several weeks, we have entered into put option contracts providing a floor of $50 WTI and $51 Brent for most of our second half 2017 oil production. With this protection in place, we will move forward with our Permian Basin capital program knowing that any price weakness will not cause a funding shortfall. We chose to use put options to mitigate the risk, while maintaining full exposure to upside price potential. In terms of other guidance, we have chosen to expand annual guidance around selected production and financial metrics. This is provided in our quarterly financial and operation supplement. John has already covered production and CapEx, so I will move directly to financial items. Please note that all guidance is based on our plan assuming $50 WTI and $51 Brent. My comments here will be relatively brief, so please feel free to follow-up with Gary and his team for any questions as you incorporate the data into your models. In 2017, we will continue to focus on lease operating expense and enhancing our margins. However, given our production declines in the first half of the year and some expected service price inflation, we see lease operating expense rising to somewhere between $8.50 and $9 per BOE. We estimate gathering and transportation costs will be $200 million to $250 million. Our portion of 2017 cost expense to G&A on the income statement is projected to be around $450 million and our capitalized portion of interest should be around $65 million. Cash income taxes should be approximately $125 million, which is driven entirely by the profitability of our North Sea operations. Finally, we are forecasting approximately $150 million of exploration expense in 2017. This includes recurring exploration overhead costs and planned exploration expense activities. This excludes any dry hole expense or unproved property impairments, which are difficult to project in terms of timing and magnitude. In closing, Apache took a prudent approach to capital spending through the downturn. This has put the company on firm ground going into 2017. We are now very well positioned to fund the capital program that will deliver long-term returns-focused growth, primarily from the Midland and Delaware Basins. We look forward to a successful 2017. And I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: And your first question is from John Herrlin of Société Générale.
John P. Herrlin - Société Générale: Yes. Thank you. For the Midland wells and the curve improvements that you've demonstrated, can you kind of attribute what you thought the improvements were in terms of landing zones, fracs, well length? Or is it just too hard to generalize?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: No, John, I mean, we took time and, really over the last two years, worked on our programs. We focused on targeting there, we did a lot of core work and really zoned in on where do we want to be landing the wells. I can tell you, in general, we went back to higher fluid volumes. They are more stage numbers they're closer together and we actually reduced our sand concentration significantly, so it really is part of the optimization process. We're very excited about the results and since we're flowing back in pads versus one well per section, we're very confident in those results and it's really attributable to the work that the team's done at the detail level in integrating core into the completion optimization process.
John P. Herrlin - Société Générale: Okay. Thanks, John. My next one from me is on the Alpine High gas. You mentioned that you've had a lot of interest from industry. Are you looking for index contracts, long-term contracts? I mean, how are you thinking about things?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: I mean, I think right now, most of it will be priced off of Waha, is how we're thinking about it. We're very early. The thing I think that we've seen is that on the longer-term view there is a need out there for supply and so I think we'll have some optionality and we're really starting to think about that and think longer-term with larger volumes.
Operator: Your next question is from Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yes. Good morning, and thanks for the update last week as well. So, you've further de-risked more of the Alpine High in your statements last week, at multiple landing zones in some of the wet gas. But when we look at the well results outside of the Northwest of the play, where you've had some really good wells, Redwood, Spruce, and Mont Blanc. The market is really just not being impressed by the flow rates. So, maybe just a reiteration of what excites you in the rest of the acreage that the market's not been pleased by?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, thanks, Ed. I'd say first and foremost, we've been drilling kind of cookie-cutter wells that are designed to test the rock in the stratigraphy. I think the important piece of information we brought forward was the overpressure to the south. In fact, now, if you look at the pressure gradient across the whole play in the bottom zone, it's all lower pressure. Clearly, as we move to the far northwest, you're deeper and there's even more overpressure. But as we look back, the one well we disclosed, a couple of different wells, but the Hidalgo well actually, we believe, we had to spud that well before we had the 3-D in. And we believe it is drilled. In fact, we now know it's not on the proper azimuth. We've got a couple of wells coming that we're excited about that will be on the proper azimuth. But what was impressive to us was how flat the well has been. It leveled off and hasn't budged and the water is continuing to come down. So, we're very impressed with it. The pressure gradients were higher and the thing that we've been able to see is the entire column as well. So, if you look back, the process we've taken, the very first Woodford wells were all in the middle part of the section. We've now validated there's a stronger upper zone. We believe there's a third landing zone as well on the lower, which would give you three landing zones in the Woodford alone. And if I take you back to the Barclays disclosure in September last year, we really assigned just one landing zone on part of our acreage to the Woodford and the Barnett. So, I know everybody wanted big flow rates. We don't have the processing facilities in place yet to do that. We are under flaring rules and so drilling longer laterals with bigger fracs right now is just not the optimal use of our dollars. But, we are moving into a phase where we have line of sight now on connection to the gas markets, where we can start to stretch some things out and actually start to demonstrate what we know this rock will do. So, we're very excited to be shifting gears as we start into the optimization process, but bottom line on it is that there are many, many landing zones, a vast resource, and we're excited about the potential across the whole hydro-column, all the way from the dry gas to the wet gas up into the oil zones, which we're about to get to. The last thing I'll say, I was at your conference last week, we said we have eight wells that are currently in process that will be targeting shallower zones from 9,500 to 11,000 feet. So, we know the gas gets richer and the liquids content is going to go up and we do anticipate seeing some oil as well. So, we're excited.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And then we're all watching the data, but the other big item obviously is getting this pipe in place, maybe just an update on the progress in terms of getting the infrastructure in place to be able to flow these wells a little bit more optimally?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, we've got July circled on the calendar and...
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: July 4?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: ...we're obviously on a path to get there and the way we give guidance and things, I would expect we'd be able to make what we've told you we'd be able to do.
Operator: Your next question is from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.
Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks, good afternoon. Maybe a little bit on the King Hidalgo well. You obviously saw some area that there was overpressure there. It looks like the well, based on your presentation a week or two ago, indicated that it was flown with ESP. Can you discuss, is that in-line with your expectation? Or would you have expected that to be flowing naturally a little bit longer?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: No, Scott, I mean, if you look at the well, still a lot of load coming back. I mean, most of these wells we've moved ESPs in early to get the water off of them. You see a trend on that well that's coming down. As I mentioned, it's not on the optimal azimuth, and we've seen that in some of the wells in the other parts of the play. Getting them on the right azimuth will make a difference as well. But, we're absolutely thrilled with the well and think when you start to look at the curve and realize that really from about day 33 on through we're now over 100 days, the thing has not budged. The oil's been slowly coming down, and it is cutting a little bit of oil with it as well. So, we're very excited about it. I will reiterate, this is only a 3,300 foot lateral and we had a limited number of frac stages in the small frac. And it's not on the optimal azimuth.
Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And just to clarify then, then if you would have been on the proper azimuth, then obviously had a more optimal frac, you would have expected that to be flowing naturally a little bit longer? Is that a fair statement?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, there are different areas in terms of how the wells flow back. A lot of the wells we've run subs in early they get the water off of them. We've got some instances where they haven't needed them. And I think the different azimuth will relate to a different profile on the water, higher IP, and obviously we think the productivity is going to go up when we optimize the frac. So, I think it will change the shape and the IP capacity of the well and so forth more than anything.
Operator: Your next question is from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.
Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Could you talk about the Suriname prospect; sort of days to drill, when we might get some news, the chance of success, and maybe a risk size, if you're willing to give that?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Bob, at this point, it's a well we're very excited about; Block 53 we own 45% of. We've got two partners in there. The rig is on its way to location now, as we speak. We should be spudding it probably late next week. As Tim said in his prepared remarks, it's probably a 70-days, 10-week type well. I'll say it's an exploration well. It's a well we need to drill. We're excited about it. And that's all we've really disclosed on it. I will also tell you we're working the 3-D on Block 58, which we have 100%, we're really thrilled about as well. So, if I had my druthers, I might be drilling 58 first, but the timing is the opposite. But we're very excited about the Kolibri (46:41) prospect and we'll come back with the results in 70 days, 80 days, roughly.
Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And is it a fully strat trap, or is there a structural component?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It is a strat trap.
Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good afternoon.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Hey, Brian.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: My first question is with regards to decline rates outside of Permian Basin and outside of Alpine High. Given the focus on those two areas, can you just refresh us on how we should think about some of those decline rates in a budget that stays relatively flat in 2018 relative to 2017?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, what I would say, Brian, is overall our North American decline rates probably on average about 20%. It's come down significantly over the last two years as we have not been investing in a lot of those projects and plays. It's about where it would sit now. Some areas are a little heavier, some areas are a little lighter; but in general, that's kind of where that overall base decline rate would be today. As we start to go back to work in some of the other areas, we'll be bringing on some higher decline stuff and it'll start to trend back in the future.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And what about the areas outside? And where are you at these days in Egypt and North Sea?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: With the international, depending like you're seeing, we pulled the third quarter turnaround in the North Sea after the second quarter, so it's going to be lumpy at times. We see relatively flat for our international over the next couple years. The one thing that drives Egypt is the price and the way the production sharing contracts work, so you're seeing our nets come down a little bit as prices started to improve late last year. And that's going to have a little bit of an impact as we look into the out years as depending on price, but pretty stable.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good afternoon. I just quickly want to go back to the press release and you guys commented how your budget of $3.1 billion would exceed your planned cash flow for ops. Guys, is that inclusive of the dividend when you all made that comment?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Arun, it is and it's also at the $50 price deck. So, what we state in there was with the sales that we have already in the house, over $400 million and with where strips would be today, that would cover dividend and everything.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. So that comment was including the dividend as well?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yes.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And thanks for the longer-term disclosure and thoughts through 2018. I was wondering as we work on our models, if you could help us think about the oil and gas and the liquids mix, particularly as we get into 2018, just given how Alpine High is going to be more on the wetter gas side of the equation?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, what we've done, Arun, we gave you a corporate level numbers. We showed you kind of a North American production outlook and then we really broke down the key driver, which is Midland, Delaware. We showed you an overall number and we've showed you the oil piece. What we did not show you is the liquid yield on the gas and, quite frankly, Alpine is going to be the driver there. And the big thing is by July of this year, we'll have facilities up and running. We'll have more data. We can come back then and start to update the NGL yields and some of those things. I'll also tell you that given the program we have today, which is more wet gas driven with a lot of tests in the oil zone still yet to come, we've got a pretty conservative mix dialed in. So, there's a good chance you get out to 2018 or even later this year where we will be updating those and giving more color. But we didn't want to get into that until we really had the facilities up and running and could really shed some light on the NGLs. And, quite frankly, we've got a lot of well still yet to test that can make things oilier.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Afternoon. John, a lot's been asked on the Permian. Let me get back to the cost. I remember year ago or so you were talking about unbundling the service costs and maybe doing something along those lines. Kind of, where do you see your current, I guess, cost progress and how should we think about it over the next 12 months? And are you having luck on that unbundling, if you will, of service cost?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, the answer is absolutely, David. I mean that's kind of the model we've taken. We did see the pumping pressure go up in December. If you look at our overall well costs – and I can have Tim give some more color in just a second to kind of add on to what I'll say here. We have forecasted some inflation in total, probably around 10%. What we don't have dialed in is efficiencies. I think areas like Alpine High where we're still very early we've got a lot of room to move on the efficiency curve as we get in to drill these things. Quite frankly, a few of the laterals that we drilled in the upper zones, we were surprised that the pressure gradients were higher and we had to run some shorter laterals than we had originally planned. So, as we learn those you're going to see things come down, but we've unbundled. Tim pointed out in his comments there that we've done some things, the frac crews, where we've indexed some portions with commodity price. So, we're trying to get creative on how to make it really a win-win as we work through this. But absolutely, still unbundling, very confident in where our cost structure is. We've secured most of our services for the next couple years. So we feel good about what we've got in our numbers. Is there anything you want to add, Tim?
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: The only other thing I might mention, about half of our Permian rigs, a little bit more than half, we do have under longer-term contracts, anywhere from six months to 1.5 year contract. So, we don't see a big push on that. As far as pumping services go, we've seen an increase to-date between 15% and 20%. And on our sand, we've seen an increase to-date about 10%. But, as John mentioned, we do have agreements in place that are tied to WTI. So as we see a 10% increase in WTI, we will only see about a 3% to 5% increase in service costs.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then, John, Central Basin Platform, how should we think about? Is there any capital going to that this year?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: There is a little bit, David. I mean, it's a cash cow for us. It's why we split it out from the numbers in terms of where the growth investment is. We're excited about – I mean we remain optimistic and excited about the Central Basin Platform. Quite frankly, with more cash flow, there's more projects to do there. But there are things we don't have to do. And so there's a fine line of balancing. One of the things that we should be doing versus what you can be doing. But we've got slight decline there. It's much lower than the North American numbers that I gave, well under 10% on average, and it's a significant source of volume and cash flow for us. After Egypt – Egypt, Central Basin Platform and North Sea are really the three cash drivers – cash flow generators for the corporation right now. So, an important part of our portfolio and the nice thing about it is the longevity.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question is from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers.
Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good afternoon. I just want to make sure I understood the slide 25, when I look at it, the 50% compound average growth rate in Permian. Should I think of most of Alpine High's early potential as built into this forecast? Or can Alpine High represent some upside to the forecast? And if it could, could you discuss the high level variables?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean, Jeff, it is built into that forecast right now. We roped it in. Now, I'll tell you, like we always do, we're going to guide in things that we feel like we can deliver. So, it's not our Permian. That's just the Midland and Delaware. So, I think there were a few folks that got that mixed up this morning in their notes and forgot that we've got 72,000 BOEs a day on the Central Basin Platform, but that is just the Midland and Delaware Basin curves. It does have Alpine in it. I think it is a good look, conservative look for us for right now and it's liable to get stronger and liable to get more oily. But I'll leave it. For right now, that's what we put out.
Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. And the other question I wanted to ask was with regard to slide eight, the Other North America. I was just wondering, if this primarily includes the Montney. Is there something else in there? I'm really asking just because it seems like Apache's continuing to try to simplify the portfolio to the Permian Basin and international assets?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, that's going to be predominantly our Canadian assets and what we call our Houston region, which would be our conventional Anadarko and our Eagle Ford assets. So that's heavily influenced by Canada as well as the – I think we've got Guam in there as well, but just a much smaller volume.
Operator: Your next question is from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, John, and to the rest of your team there. I wondered if you could give us an update perhaps on the two wells that you talked about. In your conference last week, you talked about were flowing back the (57:31). I believe it's the 7H in the Penn and also the Redwood well. I believe it's 4H that was the horizontal in the Wolfcamp. And I'm specifically wondering on the Redwood well. Is that in that same part of the Wolfcamp that gave you the 700 barrels a day from the vertical drills in test back last year?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, I mean, at this point, we have not provided updates, Charles, on either of those wells. We are in the area where we were seeing the DST. What I'll also tell you, though, is we had a lot of open hole above us and that's where we, obviously, took a big pressure kick. We let it flow, flowed for about 10 days, was making 700 oil. But we had a lot of column above us. And we showed in the Credit Suisse package that we thought that was probably in a more gassy regime. So we will see. There's a good chance that oil may be coming from some of the up hole zones that also look fantastic as well. But you know, the DST, you had open column but that is where the tool was when we took the kick. So, still to be determined as we delineate and get to that.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: No. That's helpful color, John. I think it just emphasizes how much there is still left to figure out here. And then second question, if I could switch over to the Midland Basin, Tim, you went through the, some of the big pads you have coming online early in 2017. Once we get to the back half of 2017 and into 2018, are we going to be at or are you going to be more at a steady-state of bringing pads online? Will you have built-up enough momentum at that point? Or should we expect ongoing lumpiness in the Midland Basin program?
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Yeah, the difference is, as we mentioned, in 2016, we only ran one rig for the majority of the year. And we just added additional rigs toward the back-half of the year, and now we're just now getting some pads online. Now we've got the pad we talked about, we've got one that's flowing back today. Now, we've got a nine-well pad at Azalea that will be coming back on in April, and then we've got another six-well pad back at Powell that will come on mid-May. And then you get into the back-half, again, we will be drilling with pads, but we're going to have continual operations. It will be a bit lumpy because it is pad drilling, but I think you're going to see a much more steady stream of wells coming across in the back-half.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: The other thing I would say there is if we've got more cash flow, that's going to be one of the first areas that you can see us pick up some more rigs and activity. I mean, Midland, Delaware are going to be the areas that you'll see, you know, if prices were to move up, we have more cash flow, that's where you'd see us accelerating.
Operator: And your last question is from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi, guys. Appreciate the color. Could you just go back to a high-level question? In terms of your infrastructure spend in the Alpine High, what are really your long-term assumptions here? Where do you think this is going in terms of the ultimate volumes over time? How are you going to sell the gas? And what your assumptions are for spending as much money as you are right now? Thanks.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Well, Paul, I mean, I think if you lay out, we spent $200 million last year, we've laid out $500 million the next two years. We're very excited. I mean, the first two phases of this are going to take us several years in. We won't have a decision point to make on staying with re-fridge, which is kind of the base case we have in the field right now, or do we go to cryo? But as I said on the earnings call last August, we're not talking hundreds of millions of cubic feet of gas here a day, we're talking multiple Bcfs, a very rich gas, wet gas, NGLs, and we think there's going to be also a lot of oil to go with it. So, we're very excited about what we have in front of us. I think once we are able to get the processing equipment in the field and things running, you'll start to see some things in terms of lateral lengths, optimized fracs, and we'll start to show you really what this resource is capable of doing. So, we're very excited about it, and I think it's going to be a big underpinning item for Apache and our Permian for a long, long time.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: But you don't – can you share – I mean, you must have assumptions on where you're going to here, given the upfront spend. And we're just trying to get to a long-term sort of present value idea of what you guys are basically assuming?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yeah. And what I'll say, Paul, is just look at what we've given you. We've given you now a look into the end of 2018. I've said, it's likely conservative on what Alpine and what our Permian can do. We gave you some location counts at Barclays. We've come back now and said we've got a minimum of 3,000 confirmed locations in the wet gas window. We will unfold more as it continues to progress, but we remain very optimistic, very excited. But one thing I'll say about this field is it gets bigger. I know there was a little bit of a negative reaction to some of the rates, because everybody's expecting us to be optimizing and scaling-up our fracs and things, but we're very pleased with where we are, and the scope and scale of this field has done nothing but get bigger since our initial disclosure in September of last year.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Got you. Could I ask just one very specific one? Your Midland results have looked good. What percentage of the acreage there do you think will go to longer laterals? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yeah, most of that, we're now got 1.5 mile to two miles dialed in. We did a lot of work over the last two years buttoning down some trades. So most of the wells we're going to be drilling are 1.5 mile to two mile laterals now. So, we're excited about that as well.
Operator: This concludes our Q&A portion. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Gary Clark for closing remarks.
Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Well, thank you all for joining us. We have gone past the top of the hour, so we need to cut it off there. If you're still in the queue – and there are some left, please give us a call; feel free to give my team a call and we'll be happy to get your questions answered. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Doris, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation third quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I will turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.
Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's third quarter 2016 financial and operational results conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be: Apache CEO and President John Christmann; Executive Vice President of Operations Support Tim Sullivan; and Executive Vice President and CFO Steve Riney. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our third quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. Also, please note that Apache's third quarter 10-Q will be filed at the close of business today. I would now like to turn the call over to John.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Apache continues to make great progress on the goals we set at the beginning of the year, and our recent announcements and third quarter results underscore this positive performance. On today's call, I will discuss four primary topics. First, I will review the strategy we laid out at the beginning of 2015 to guide Apache through the downturn. I will outline how the execution of that strategy has positioned Apache for success in 2017 and beyond. Then, I will discuss our capital spending priorities as we look ahead to 2017. Following that, I will review our Permian, Egypt, and North Sea regions, and then conclude with a discussion of the Alpine High. At the start of the downturn, we established some guiding principles that have brought us to where we are today. These were: dramatically reduce development spending until price and costs come into better equilibrium; establish a strong financial position and protect it by living within cash flow; and prepare the portfolio for long-term returns, growth, and shareholder value. At the start of 2016, we put forth a very conservative capital budget of $1.6 billion. This spend level was based on a plan to live within cash flow at $35 per barrel of oil. Our capital allocation process reflected the decision to constrain capital investment in North American onshore development activities. Despite this, our North American onshore production has performed well in 2016, which is a testament to Apache's greatly improved capital efficiency and the relatively low decline rate of our Permian-anchored production base. At the beginning of 2016, our planned capital allocation for the Alpine High play was less than $100 million. As the year progressed and cash flow came in above budgeted levels, we elected to invest incremental cash flow in Alpine High rather than chase near-term production growth elsewhere. As a result, we now expect to spend approximately $500 million in Alpine High this year, which effectively accounts for the incremental cash flow above our original budget. Our financial and operational discipline has served us well. We plan to end the year with relatively unchanged net debt, and we brought forth a transformational discovery at Alpine High that will drive incremental growth and returns for years to come. With regard to next year's outlook, in February on our fourth quarter conference call, we will provide a detailed view of our 2017 capital budget and other guidance items. In the meantime, I thought it would be helpful to provide the following high-level summary of our 2017 investment priorities. Our top priority next year is funding the Alpine High. The budget will likely consist of a four- to six-rig program and a first wave of midstream build-out. The near-term pace of spending on Alpine High will be governed by the timing of infrastructure availability, as well as a prudent appraisal and delineation program. Our goal in 2017 is to ensure that investment levels do not outpace our comprehensive understanding of the opportunity or our capacity to get product to market. Our next priority is to increase development activity in our other Permian Basin focus areas. Specifically, we will add three rigs in the Midland Basin before year-end 2016, bringing our total rig count to five. This additional activity, coupled with first gas production from Alpine High, will return the Permian Basin to a strong growth trajectory in the second half of 2017. We will also continue to invest in Egypt and the North Sea at levels designed to sustain production and generate significant free cash flow. And, lastly, our other exploration projects and North American development opportunities will compete for the remaining available capital. Now turning to the third quarter. As noted in this morning's press release, Apache's adjusted production in the third quarter, which excludes tax barrels and our non-controlling interest in Egypt, was approximately 438,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is comprised of 270,000 BOEs per day in North America onshore and 168,000 BOEs per day from the international and offshore. Production in North America onshore continues to perform well despite minimal development capital. For the full-year 2016, we expect North American onshore production will be in the upper half of our most recent guidance range of 268,000 to 278,000 BOEs per day. In the Permian, while we are clearly excited about our Alpine High acreage, we are also positioned for very attractive growth and returns elsewhere in the basin. Our focus on strategic testing during the downturn has yielded excellent results in our core Midland and Delaware Basin acreage, where we have expanded and prioritized our inventory of high-return projects. Improved landing zone targeting and new completion designs are delivering strong well performance in both areas. With these improvements and the significant progress we have made on costs, we are confident in bringing growth-oriented capital investment back to the Permian Basin. As such, we have initiated a more aggressive development drilling program the Midland Basin, and will look to expand our rig count further in 2017 if warranted by commodity prices and available cash flow. Turning briefly to our international and offshore regions, production for the quarter excluding tax barrels and our non-controlling interest in Egypt, was 168,000 BOEs per day, comprising 98,000 BOEs per day from Egypt, 62,000 BOEs from the North Sea, and 8,000 BOEs from the Gulf of Mexico. During the quarter, our North Sea operations were impacted by planned and unplanned maintenance downtime, as well as third-party facilities downtime. Thus far, we have seen volumes in the fourth quarter rebound to more normalized levels. For the full-year 2016, international and offshore production is on track for the midpoint of our 170,000 to 180,000 BOE per day guidance for the year. I am very pleased with the drilling results in our international operations this year. Our exploration and development drilling success rate in Egypt and the North Sea year to date is approximately 90%. Apache made another key discovery in the North Sea this quarter in our Storr prospect. We highlighted this prospect in our North Sea investor webcast late last year, and it marks our third consecutive exploration success since acquiring 3-D seismic data in the Beryl area. This validates the quality of our 3-D seismic data and geologic modeling and gives us higher confidence in the dozens of future exploration prospects we have identified to date. Now I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our Alpine High play. The Alpine High is an immense resource and a transformational discovery for Apache. We have invested a significant amount of human and financial capital through two years of extensive geologic and geophysical work and reservoir and fluid analysis. This was accompanied by concept testing an initial round of verification wells, the results of which we disclosed in early September. We are now engaged in a methodical appraisal and delineation program to confirm the geographic and stratigraphic extent of the play and to formulate our long-term infrastructure plan. This work will continue for the next several quarters before transitioning to an active development program once gas processing and transportation infrastructure is in place. The Alpine High can be broadly characterized as five distinct target formations, all of which we believe will be highly economic. This includes the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp, which are prevalent and productive throughout the Delaware Basin. These hybrid unconventional plays are the current focus of the industry to the north and east of the Alpine High. Two early tests have demonstrated that these formations are oil productive and offer significant potential at Alpine High. More appraisal drilling in these zones is necessary before we will provide prospective location counts and resource-in-place estimates. Underlying the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp and unique to the Alpine High is a true resource play in the Pennsylvanian [Penn], Barnett, and Woodford formations. This is a world-class source rock sequence, up to 1,500 feet thick across our acreage position. Based on our appraisal program to date, we anticipate this will become a very large resource play with attractive rates of return and breakeven economics. Together, the Penn-Barnett-Woodford source rock in the two hybrid unconventional zones in the Bone Springs and the Wolfcamp are up to 5,000 feet thick across Apache's Alpine High acreage position. Given this extensive vertical column, we anticipate drilling multiple landing zones in each of these formations and ultimately defining several pipe wells and associated location counts. As a reminder, in previous disclosure, we assigned only one landing zone to each of the Barnett and the Woodford formations on only a portion of our acreage to arrive at our current 2,000 to 3,000-plus location count. When we announced Alpine High in September, we provided production results from eight horizontal wells, six in the Woodford and one each in the Barnett and Bone Springs. The objective of this initial group of wells was only to test the boundaries of specific geologic settings and evaluate certain potential hazards. We made no effort to optimize completions, well orientation, or landing zone placement. Despite this, the test wells have continued to perform very well. Since Barclays, we have flow-tested two additional wells. The Black Hawk 1H, a normally pressured Woodford well, flowed at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 5.3 million cubic feet of gas, 224 barrels of oil, and 245 barrels of NGLs. The Redwood 1H, an over-pressured Woodford well, flowed at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 18 million cubic feet of gas. This well was drilled to a vertical depth of nearly 14,000 feet, further confirming our thermal maturity model of the play and the depth limit of the wet gas window. Tim Sullivan will provide more details on our Alpine High wells in his remarks. Finally, we have closed several additional acreage transactions over the past two months, and our Alpine High position now comprises 320,000 net contiguous acres. Apache identified and captured this position for an average price of $1,300 per acre over a period of approximately two years. This very low entry cost gives us an advantage that we believe will translate into very attractive returns on capital employed compared to the alternative of acquiring prospective Delaware acreage at current transaction prices. To summarize, our near-term drilling objectives at Alpine High include: geographic testing to define geologic settings across our acreage position; stratigraphic testing to collect data from all five formations; defining the number of landing zones and the optimal well placement and orientation within each formation; and enhancing completions and testing longer laterals and well spacing to optimize full field development. At this point, we can say with confidence that the Alpine High contains thousands of predictable high-return horizontal drilling locations that will drive returns and production growth for many years to come. Importantly, Apache controls the vast majority of the play, and we have the ability to establish the pace and scope of development. Our ultimate goal is to optimize value of this extensive resource base for the maximum long-term benefit of our shareholders as well as other stakeholders. I would now like to turn the call over to Tim Sullivan and Steve Riney, who will discuss the company's drilling results, financial performance, and midstream plans before coming back for some final remarks ahead of the Q&A session.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Thank you, John, and good afternoon. My remarks today will be focused on providing more detail around results from our core areas, highlights from specific wells, and near-term development plans. Our Permian region produced 159,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, or nearly 60% of Apache's total North American onshore production. Production in the Permian Basin decreased by roughly 6,200 BOE per day from the second quarter, as their declines were buffered primarily by 13 well tie-ins and our Northwest Shelf Yeso play. In our new Delaware Basin discovery, the Alpine High, we're showing results from 10 wells, comprising eight Woodford, one Barnett, and one Third Bone Springs wells. On page 15 of the operations supplement, we have updated our production curves from the wells we showed at Barclays and have included the two most recent wells. As you can see, our Alpine High wells compare favorably with the P-50 type curves for the Marcellus, Utica, and SCOOP resource plays, with half the wells producing at or above the P-50 type curves. Keep in mind, the Alpine High wells are short laterals and have not been normalized for lateral length. Also, the completions and landing zones have not been optimized. These initial wells were drilled as appraisal wells and test-of-concept and were oftentimes drilled near hazards so that we can better understand the boundaries of the play. Given this, we are excited about the early time performance. We are shutting wells in as we complete testing and we'll collect pressure buildup data. These wells will be brought back online when we begin selling gas in 2017. The two new Alpine High wells John previously mentioned are both producing from the Woodford formation. The Black Hawk State 1H, which was drilled in a normally pressured setting, has the highest oil cut in the Woodford among the wells we have drilled to date. The Redwood 1H is the deepest well we have drilled and is our highest gas producer. We have also updated production from the Bone Springs producer Mont Blanc 2H, which can be seen on page 17 of the operations supplement. The well, which was a non-optimized completion with a short lateral, has a cumulative production of greater than 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent over 100 days and is currently producing 220 barrels of oil and 580 MCF per day with a stable GOR. Also, you can see that the water production has decreased to approximately 275 barrels per day. The wells drilled to date have confirmed the unprecedented picture of the vertical dimensions of the play of the Bone Springs to the Woodford across our acreage position, with the hydrocarbon column ranging from oil to wet gas to dry gas confirming our geologic model. We have seen a range of initial oil cuts in the Woodford from zero to 20%. The shallower Barnett well has an oil cut of 21%. These yields are in line with our thermal maturity model and can be correlated to depth. The gas is extremely rich, with an average BTU of approximately 1,300. This should provide for an average NGL yield in excess of 100 barrels per million cubic feet of natural gas when permanent facilities are in place. As expected in a resource play, Alpine High is becoming more predictable. Every well we've drilled has confirmed our model. In the Pecos Bend area in the Delaware Basin, we placed seven gross operated wells on production, all of which targeted the Third Bone Springs formation. We continue to see excellent production performance across this play. Our Blue Jay Unit 103H well continues its strong performance. Using 3-D seismic, we targeted a highly fractured area. The well has produced 427,000 barrels of oil equivalent in just under seven months, achieving an average rate of roughly 2,260 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This well is currently producing approximately 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 60% is oil. In a less fractured area of the play, we are also able to drill economic wells by utilizing pad drilling operations. On our Falcon State lease, a 6-well pad came online in mid-September, with an average 30-day rate of 625 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This pad also demonstrated our best-in-class operational efficiencies in this basin, with an average total well cost of $3.5 million per well. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform, and Northwest Shelf, we placed a combined 16 gross operated wells on production in the quarter. We ran two rigs in the third quarter, primarily in the Midland Basin, and intend to ramp up to five rigs by the end of the year. Activity is focused on stratigraphic landing zone targeting and development pad drilling in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry shale formations and our Wildfire, Azalea, and Powell focus areas. We also expect to bring 20 horizontal wells online over the next two quarters across these three areas. As we stated on our last quarter call, in the third quarter we brought online the CC 4144 East 2HM, producing from the Wolfcamp B formation at Powell. This well continues to show strong performance and has produced 136,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the first 90 days online, at an average of more than 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This well along with our Connell 38B 2HM and 38C 2HM wells were drilled with our improved targeting and completion design, which we highlighted last quarter. Please refer to page 18 in our operations supplement for a production update of our Midland Basin focus area. Subsequent to quarter end, we brought online the Lynch A 6HM, a Wolfcamp B producer in our Wildfire area in Midland County. This 8,500-foot lateral was completed with 146 frac stages at approximately 60-foot frac spacing, pumping 1,700 pounds per foot of sand. The well is still cleaning up and has not reached peak production but is flowing at a rate of 1,120 barrels of oil and 1.1 million cubic feet of gas per day. In addition to this well, we will be testing one Middle Spraberry and three Lower Spraberry wells in our Wildfire focus area later this month. Much of our previous strategic testing in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry involved completions and landing zone optimization. The improvements we are making, as demonstrated by these wells, will significantly enhance our Midland Basin program going forward. In the Northwest Shelf, we placed nine horizontal Yeso wells in production during the quarter and continue to generate very good production rates and economics from this play. The 30-day rate for these nine wells averaged almost 450 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With our best-in-class drilling and completion cost for these wells, we averaged less than $2.5 million per well. This program generates extremely favorable economics on a fully burdened basin. In addition to the nine horizontal Yeso wells, we also placed four vertical Yeso wells on production during the quarter. Outside of the Permian, Apache had no active drilling rigs operating in North America during the quarter. We did, however, test seven operated wells, all in Canada, in our Annie Creek, Montney, and Wapiti Montney focus areas. Most notably is our 9-of-23 well, completed in the Lower Montney in our Wapiti area. This well tested at an impressive initial rate of 10.6 million cubic feet of gas per day and approximately 2,000 barrels of condensate per day, with a total estimated completed well cost of $6.2 million. We are making great progress in North America, even at our low level of reinvestment. We remain focused on returns and are positioning the Permian Basin for a growth trajectory in the second half of 2017. Moving to international and offshore operations, in Egypt, gross production of 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was up slightly compared to the second quarter. On a net basis, adjusted volumes declined sequentially by 3,000 BOE per day, primarily due to the impact of improving Brent oil prices on cost recovery mechanisms and our production sharing contracts. We continue to benefit from a robust, optimized drilling program, drilling 45 producers and only five dry holes, achieving a 90% success rate through the first three quarters of 2016. Apache placed nine wells on production in Egypt during the third quarter. Most notably is the Ptah #12, producing from the Shiffah formation, with a current peak oil production of over 2,800 barrels of oil per day. Since field discovery in November 2014, the Ptah and Berenice fields have produced a combined 17 million barrels of oil equivalent from only 14 wells and are still producing at a rate of more than 38,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Well costs for this play averaged only $3.2 million per well. In the North Sea, third quarter production decreased approximately 8,300 BOE per day due to downtime resulting from planned maintenance turnarounds and third-party operated facility restrictions that impacted production. This was associated with seasonal turnarounds that occur in this region during the late summer. This deferred some 3Q production into the current period, so we expect 4Q volumes to bounce back to levels we've seen in the first half the year. As John mentioned, we also made a nice discovery at our Storr prospect in the Beryl area, which encountered hydrocarbons in two separate fault blocks. The results were in line with pre-drill estimates, and we expect to test more fault blocks at Storr in the future. Apache has a 55% working interest, with Shell holding the remaining 45%. In late October, we commenced drilling our next Beryl area prospect, Kinord, which we expect to reach TD by year-end. Please refer to our November 2015 North Sea investor update for more details on Storr, Kinord, and other opportunities in the Beryl area. I would note a new high-rate development well at the Beryl field, the Nevis North NNA, which came online mid-September. The 30-day average rate for this well was 20 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day. At our Aviat project in the Forties field, we have now completed and tied in the first well. As you may recall, Aviat enables a switch from diesel to natural gas as our primary source of power for the Forties field. This is an environmentally friendly project that will extend the economic life of Forties due to lower operating costs and reduce certain safety and reliability risk associated with bunkering diesel to our platforms. We estimate our annual diesel savings due to this project at $15 million per year. Importantly, using natural gas to fuel the Forties field should enable us to maintain higher and more stable water injection rates, which should in turn result in higher sustained hydrocarbon production from the field. In Suriname, we completed our 3-D seismic shoot on Block 58 in September, and we will have preliminary processing results by year-end and a fully processed data set in the third quarter of 2017. On the adjacent Block 53, we will commence drilling operations on a commitment well in the first quarter of next year, the Kolibri #1. While this is an attractive and sizable exploration prospect, very few wells have been drilled to this depth offshore Suriname, and as such, carries a significant amount of risk. The dry hole cost to Apache for this well is estimated at less than $40 million. To sum up international and offshore, while activity was limited, we had very good exploration and development results in both Egypt and the North Sea during the third quarter. We're excited about the future exploration potential in our international and offshore portfolio and look forward to providing more details in the future. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I will discuss the following. First, I will review our financial results for the third quarter and provide updated 2016 guidance on selected items. Next, I will provide a few details on our near-term Alpine High infrastructure development activities, which have the primary purpose of achieving first gas sales around mid-2017. Then I will conclude by outlining the framework that we intend to follow as we put together our 2017 capital budget. Before I dive into our (28:44), I want to remind everyone that all of our numbers I will review on today's call are now reported under the Successful Efforts accounting method. For those who would like to compare these results to those under the Full Cost accounting method we used in the past, please reference the 10-Q that will be filed later today. As noted in our press release, Apache reported a loss of $607 million or $1.60 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates. This includes a $355 million impairment of certain proved properties in Canada as a result of downward reserve revisions related to well performance and lower expected net gas realizations. In addition, with the reduction of the UK petroleum revenue tax, or PRT, to 0% in September, we recognized a charge of $481 million to eliminate the PRT benefit associated with certain future abandonment costs. Despite the apparent negative impacts of the change, in the long term the reduction in the PRT tax rate will improve our North Sea returns. When excluding these and other smaller items, our adjusted loss for the quarter was $12 million or $0.03 per share. In the third quarter, Apache generated $651 million in cash flow from operations. We operated near cash flow neutrality after paying dividends and after increasing capital expenditures in the Alpine High and in our core Midland Basin. As a result, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash. Our 2016 CapEx guidance, which we updated in early September, remains unchanged at $2 billion. And we still intend to end the year with unchanged or lower net debt. A combination of asset disposal proceeds and a significant U.S. tax refund, both anticipated in the fourth quarter, should enable us to achieve our targeted cash balance of $1.5 billion at year end. Turning to costs, lease operating costs in the third quarter were $7.94 per barrel of oil equivalent, approximately 10% lower than the same period last year. As previously guided, LOE per barrel of oil equivalent increased from the second quarter due to higher seasonal maintenance activity and increased workover expenses. While we expect LOE per BOE to trend a little higher in the fourth quarter, we are again revising our full-year 2016 guidance down to less than $8 per barrel of oil equivalent. This just reinforces the tremendous progress we have made on costs this year. On the G&A side, our gross overhead spend, which we've defined on previous calls, continues to track toward the lower end of our 2016 guidance of $650 million to $700 million. As such, you can now expect our 2016 gross overhead spend to be about $650 million. Lastly, exploration expense in the third quarter was $161 million. $114 million of this was attributable to unproved leasehold impairments in Canada, the Eagle Ford, and the Canyon Lime. Last quarter we guided to $250 million to $300 million of exploration expense for the full year. With the incremental impairment from the third quarter, we now expect full-year 2016 exploration expense in the range of $350 million to $400 million. I would now like to provide a few details on our Alpine High infrastructure development plans. There's currently very limited infrastructure in the immediate vicinity of our acreage. During the course of delineation drilling, Apache has installed skid-mounted refrigeration units to process gas and recover natural gas liquids. NGL recovery volumes are currently constrained by the capability of these temporary units. We have also installed separation facilities to recover oil. Both the oil and the NGLs are being trucked to local sales points. These temporary arrangements will over time be replaced by more permanent solutions. The initial objective of our infrastructure investment is to establish permanent gas processing capacity and transportation of residue gas to market sales points. First gas sales are expected in the middle of 2017. Field processing of the gas stream will be accomplished using refrigeration units at key locations across the acreage. These units are modular and can be expanded commensurate with increasing production. This will help optimize the pace of capital deployment and maximize efficiency. A high priority during the initial phases of field development is to ensure that production is not limited by processing or transportation capacity. The gas takeaway infrastructure will include 60 miles of 30-inch diameter trunk line that will traverse our entire Alpine High acreage position. Major third-party transport lines are currently situated or are under construction in locations approximately 10 miles to the north and south of the Apache leasehold. The Waha hub is located less than 50 miles to the east of Apache's acreage and provides access to most major U.S. markets. Apache is currently evaluating numerous options to utilize these points of access to both U.S. and Mexico gas market opportunities. We will install the trunk line across the Alpine High and establish most market connections through 2017 and 2018. As indicated previously, NGLs are currently being transported by truck to local sales points. As production volumes increase, NGLs will eventually exceed trucking capacity and will require pipeline transport. Apache is evaluating options for the type of gas processing and the means of access to major NGL markets. There will be additional disclosure regarding these plans in the future. Apache's Alpine High infrastructure strategy will address both the near-term requirement for market access during the appraisal and delineation phase as well as the long-term requirements for optimizing value through the transition to full field development. As the ultimate production potential of the Alpine High is better understood, the long-term infrastructure requirements will be formulated accordingly. As with all capital decisions at Apache, infrastructure investment and full field development decisions at Alpine High will be made with full-cycle, fully burdened long-term returns as a key priority. To reiterate some of John's early comments, as we think about our 2017 capital allocation process, we will do so based on a continuation of our core principles. We will focus on living within our means, maintaining our strong financial position, and investing to improve long-term returns. We will provide the details of our 2017 capital plan and guidance in February. However, I would like to share three of the key themes in this year's planning process. First, the Alpine High and the rest of the Permian Basin will be high priorities for our capital program. We fully expect to return the Permian Basin to a strong growth trajectory in the second half of 2017. We are pleased with the improvements we made during the downturn across our portfolio, and we are now prepared to execute on our robust growth plan. Second, we will continue to fund our Egypt and North Sea assets to sustain production and free cash flow. Our returns in these regions are highly competitive, and the free cash flow is critical for funding growth opportunities without resorting to dilutive equity raises. Finally, we are fortunate to have many quality assets that will compete for capital funding throughout the portfolio. In some situations, when funding availability is scarce, we have the luxury of deferring investments without significantly impacting underlying values. With that, I will turn the call back over to John.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Thank you, Steve. Before taking questions, I wanted to make a few closing comments. Apache used the industry downturn to drive substantial change and improvement. We drastically reduced our cost structure, implemented a rigorous and integrated capital allocation and planning process, upgraded and expanded our drilling inventory, improved our capital efficiency, and positioned ourselves extremely well for the future. We invested a high percentage of our precious capital in strategic testing and captured the Alpine High play. This significant new discovery reflects not only the company's strategic focus on organic growth, but also highlights the strong technical capabilities that were necessary to discover and secure it. In 2017, we will continue to manage oil and gas price volatility by setting a reasonable expected price band and gearing our capital spending, return targets, and capital structure to the lower end of that band. Should realized prices come in higher, we will maintain the operational and financial flexibility and optionality to respond accordingly, as we have done in 2016. Our overall strategic approach will remain unchanged. Apache will live within its means, maintain its strong financial position, continue to build and develop our high-quality drilling inventory, and invest our capital with a primary focus on improving long-term returns and creating shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A.
Operator: Our first question is from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Congratulations again on Alpine High. Just on the gas line first, I mean a 30-inch line. Maybe give us some idea of how much capacity that would have because obviously that's probably going to be the governor on the size of the play in the beginning.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Ed, at this point I don't want to talk about capacity. I think a 30-inch line will tell you that it will move a tremendous amount of gas.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's what I thought.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: So I just want to leave it at that, because obviously with compression and so forth, you can do a lot there. But we're not in the position to talk about scale. That's just the main trunk line through the field and in terms of what we have to run from north to south.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then slide 17 caused some debate today. Bone Spring well, obviously great initial rate, and then a decline down to 220 barrels a day. Maybe talk a little bit about the proppant loading, the landings and optimization, because in delineation you're not doing a lot of that. So maybe talk about the hopes you have to improve that performance over time. Obviously this is a short lateral as well.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: I think the first thing is, and Tim Sullivan did a good job in the script of walking through this. What we've got is a hydrocarbon system that has 5,000 feet of stack pay. And so what the purpose of that well really to do was, was to prove that we have oil production at a depth of around 9,000 feet, which confirms our geologic model and our thermal maturity model. So quite frankly, we're very pleased with that well. It's a very short lateral. It's a small frac. It was more designed to test the geologic model and the maturity model. And quite frankly, what's impressive about it is the GOR has been stable and is relatively flat, and you've seen the water lines come down. So we're quite pleased with it. As we've said all along, we have not tried to drill big press release wells that are going to blow everybody away with their production rates. This was a well that was designed to confirm we have oil production. We have a very rich column all the way from 9,000 feet down to 14,000 feet, which the Redwood confirmed when we move from oil down to wet gas down to dry gas. And the beauty of it is, unlike other plays where you have a 200-foot zone that you're trying to track aerially across windows, we've got such a thick column here and we have the maturity all the way up the column. So all we have to do is move our pole and we will have more oil and so forth. So as we get into further test points and start to delineate and start to drill some other wells, we'll bring on some other things. But the important point here is it validates there is oil production at 9,100 feet and 43 gravity API, and I think it's something we're very excited about.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good afternoon. John, I was wondering if you could maybe just compare and maybe contrast the opportunity set for oil in the Woodford and Barnett. I think you talked about in the prepared remarks thinking about maybe a 20% oil cut in the Barnett, zero to 20% in the Woodford. And then maybe also talk about how things could play out for the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Arun, as I just mentioned, we've got a model that is confirmed and has been validated. And really, the oil cut is going to be a function of thermal maturity and the depth of burial. And so as you move up, the only Barnett well we've drilled has a 20% cut. Below that, in the deeper Woodford wells we've drilled, we've anywhere from zero up to 21%. So the point in this whole thing is that we've got multiple zones across a window, a hydrocarbon system that we know has hydrocarbons ranging from oil from 9,000 feet and probably shallower – I mean, we've got some other indications it could go shallower – down to 14,000 feet. So those cuts are going to be a function of which rock we place in those depths. And quite frankly, the transgressive sequence from the Woodford up through the Penn, it really doesn't matter what age it was laid down. It's more a function of where it is in the maturity model. And so as we move up, we will see higher oil cuts, and we're confident in that. And we've got wells that we're drilling that we'll be bringing forth in the future that will design those. You can look at the oil cut in the Mont Blanc 2H, and it's very good at 9,100 feet. So I've tried to articulate what you've got is a hydrocarbon system, okay, which is unique because we've got five stack pays, different types of rocks. And as you move up, the cuts are all going to be a function of depth and temperature. And that's the good thing about it is everything's been validated and we can predict it, and everything's coming in at or better than our model would suggest.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's helpful. And just switching gears a little bit, Steve, I was wondering if you could just comment. In Egypt, they did free float their currency, and there has been a pretty significant devaluation versus the dollar. Can you talk about the impact to Apache in terms of the devaluation?
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah, so the direct financial impact is pretty minimal, actually, Arun. By contract, all of our revenues come in U.S. dollars, both on the gas and on the oil side. Oil, we actually export, sell in the open market, and get U.S. dollars into U.S. bank accounts. On the cost side, we do have some costs that are based in Egyptian pounds, which means that we're a net Egyptian pound buyer. On a quarterly basis, we buy about $100 million worth of Egyptian pounds. And we buy them obviously at a rate at which we would consume them. So the logical conclusion would be that the devaluation would benefit us on the cost side. But actually, we would anticipate that inflation would mostly offset that over time. And then, just as a general rule, on a day-to-day basis, we generally hold a pretty minimal amount of Egyptian pounds at any one point in time. And just as an example, at September 30 we had a little over $50,000 worth of Egyptian pounds on hand. So the actual exposure to the Egyptian pound in a direct financial basis is pretty minimal. Of course, the more macro issue is that Egypt is going through a very difficult time. They're doing all of the right things, but it's going to be very difficult, and it's going to be tough on the economy, and we obviously keep a very close eye on that.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on a couple of the earlier questions. First with regards to the midstream and Alpine High, if you can't give us the specifics on the capacity on the gas front that you're trying to expand to at least initially, can you just talk to the CapEx strategy and what we should expect that midstream spending to look like for at least the shorter term, kind of next year, year and a half type piece?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Brian, when we come out in February with our year-end call and give a look on 2017, we'll give some specific color. Obviously, this year, we've ramped up to $500 million in the Alpine High play, and we said 40% of that would be towards the midstream. I'll say directionally, you'll probably see numbers go up next year in Alpine, but I'm not in a position to give you a whole lot more color than that. I mean, the good news is we can fund it, and we're on a pace to bring on really this first big phase that will carry us through what ultimately would be a bigger build-out in subsequent years. So it'll be done incrementally and in a way that we can handle it.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: Yeah, I would also say – so let's start with the 30-inch trunk line. That is a trunk line through the field, but we have three directions in which we can connect to markets. And eventually I would hope and assume that we would be connected in all three directions, and therefore the trunk line can flow in different directions. And obviously therefore, it's not – the amount of gas that the field can produce is not limited by a unilateral flow of gas through the trunk line. It can flow in different directions. And then there will be a third connection most likely to the east from the middle of the field over to Waha. So the capacity of the field to produce and transport gas out is not actually limited by one-direction flow of a 30-inch line with compression. I think you could probably get a pretty good estimate of what the capital costs are going to be over the next few years. We're going to put in all the pipes and the connects over the next two years, 2017-2018. We're actually going to begin construction on the trunk line before the end of this year. So we'll have trunk line connections, hopefully north-south into Waha, and an NGL line, most likely into the Waha direction as well, by the end of 2018. And I think industry estimates probably work to figure out the cost of that. A 60-mile trunk line less than 10 miles to the north and south, and then just less than 50 miles over to Waha. On the processing side, we're going to be – you can put in refrigeration units in the 50 million to 100 million cubic feet per day increments. That works economically. And for both processing and compression, an industry cost estimate of somewhere in the $0.40 to $0.60 per cubic feet per day in terms of capital spending is probably a reasonable estimate. So whatever you're assuming in terms of our development profile and production profile, you can pretty much match a field processing and compression profile with that and get a decent estimate of the capital spending. We do anticipate that we will put in processing and compression capacity in advance of us needing it, so we won't be takeaway constrained – processing or takeaway constrained. We'll be well deliverability constrained.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you. And the follow-up is I had a couple small questions on the international front. One, in your prepared comments, you referenced I think a reserve reservoir performance issue in Canada. I just wondered if there's a little bit more color there. And then on the back of Arun's question on Egypt devaluation, do you have confidence that for domestic consumers of oil and gas that the prices will be – the currency devaluation will be passed along?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: A couple things, Brian. I didn't see anything on a reserve impact in Canada. I'm looking at Steve...
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: It was the impairment.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: It was the impairment.
Stephen J. Riney - Apache Corp.: So we had an impairment in Canada, and it was due to reserves related to both well performance but also to net-back realizations and the impact on PUDs that were booked at that point in time. So we took a reserve write-down in Canada, and the $355 million pre-tax impairment was related to the reserves.
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: In regards to Egypt, Brian, having just gotten back from there the week before last, and my third trip over there, I've actually seen President Al-Sisi twice this year. I've got to give them a lot of credit. They're on the right path. They're doing the right things. They're in the process of securing a loan from the IMF. This is all part of a process to go through and start to take some of the subsidies out and do the things to put the country onto the right track. So I actually feel very good about where things are. Our relationship is good. I think they understand how important Apache is. So we feel very good about that aspect of it. They've just got to go through a reset. And the good news is they're taking this head on and they're working on doing that. So we feel good about our overall situation though.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of John Herrlin with Société Générale.
John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale: Close enough, guys. Anyway, you're not willing to quite say what you think everything can do with the Alpine High when it's installed and you don't want to front 2017 expenditures. But looking out and saying longer term, what do you think a normalized volume growth model would be for Apache once you're further along versus an also fiscally conservative approach where you're not diluting people, where you're living within your means?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Obviously, John, you can look at the math, and things change significantly for us starting in the back half of 2017. What I'll say is when we look at the volumes coming out of Alpine High, we're not talking hundreds of millions of cubic feet of gas a day, you're probably talking billions a day with a lot of oil and liquids associated with it. So our profiles are going to change dramatically. I think when we come out in 2017, we'll talk a little bit about 2017, and most of that is going to occur in the back half of 2017. So we'll start to give some color, but it's going to be a different profile then we've probably had in our history.
John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale: Okay, that's fair. Regarding the Midland, a lot of companies now are going out 10,000 feet and beyond. Is that something in your wheelhouse too that you're considering doing?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Yes. The big controlling factor there, obviously, is the land ownership. We showed a well in the ops report today that's about 8,500 feet. So clearly where we have the land to do that, your limitation isn't the rock in terms of how far you can drill. So we'll be drilling as long laterals as we can and optimizing those on pads.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Apache Corp.: Brian, one comment I might make as well on that is we spent a good portion – or a good amount of work this year on blocking up our acreage at three of our fields at Powell, Wildfire, and Azalea. And as a result, we feel like about 2/3 of our locations now will be extended laterals between the mile and a half to two mile.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.
Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I had a question on – I hear you saying that you want to live within cash flow to grow this program. Would you consider asset sales as another source of funds to maybe accelerate this program, and are there parts of the portfolio that would be ripe for that?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: Bob, the thing I would say is the good news is our pace for the development of Alpine is going to be governed at the start based on the build-out of the infrastructure and just the amount of time it takes to collect the data and do this properly in a way that's going to maximize the NPV and the returns. So it's not a matter of needing more capital to try to accelerate Alpine, the Alpine High play. It's going to get its capital at that pace. And then amazingly, it becomes cash flow positive pretty fast and self-funding. I think the bigger question will be as we look at the portfolio, Steve mentioned in his comments, we've got a lot of things we can defer as we have really the last two years. As we shut down, we're doing strategic testing and stuff. Most of our acreage is HBP. We've got a lot of really other attractive plays, and a lot of that will depend on what capital budget we want to run and what price deck we're comfortable spending at in terms of how we feather those in and that sort of thing. If there clearly are things at higher prices that we don't envision ourselves getting to, then obviously we would be looking at some of those options over the next couple years. So those are all things that would be on the table.
Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks, and a quick follow-up. Can you talk about the process by which you got board sanction for this big 30-inch pipe big infrastructure investment? Did you present them with a 20-year project asset level, and what was that process like?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: What I would say is they had the scope and scale of the Alpine High. We're in a process where they have seen numbers going into 2017 and have sanctioned those. And the cost of this for what we've got identified looks fantastic, but it is a board-level approval and has been approved by our Board of Directors under our normal course of business.
Operator: And our last question is from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks for squeezing me in. John, if I think about – I know you said you won't comment on 2017, but I'm going to try to ask anyway. If I just think about your regional CapEx mix that was in your slide deck this morning on page 26, you have 50% – Permian and Alpine High get 50%, and then 50% other are outside of U.S. onshore. Is that the right way to think about it as far as a 2017 number, just based on obviously whatever the cash flow and prices end up being? But is that the right allocation?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: What I would say is Alpine is going to get its capital. We're going to invest to sustain North Sea and Egypt. Permian is going to get a big chunk of its capital. And then how that pie changes is going to be a function of what price deck we're comfortable running with and how much capital we pour. So we've seen a lot of volatility. We've gone from the low $50s to the mid-$40s. And so obviously every $5 of oil price and the movement of gas price means a lot to us in terms of that. So as we start out 2017, a lot of that's just going to hinge on what price we've got we feel comfortable using. The good news is we made a lot of progress over the last 18 months, not just on our Alpine and just on our Permian. We've got a lot of really strong projects that are very competitive. We've got a nice SCOOP position in the Woodford with 52,000 net and 200,000 gross acres out there, a nice little position in the STACK. You've seen some of the results from some of the Montney and the Duvernay today. So we've got a lot of other quality projects that we're fortunate that we can defer a few of those. But it's all going to hinge on ultimately where we shake down on the capital plan going into 2017 is going to be where will we'll start. And of course, the main thing is we're going to maintain the flexibility like we did this year by budgeting a little bit conservatively to then react and ramp up because we've got a lot of optionality and a lot of opportunity in our portfolio both within the Permian and the other parts of the portfolio.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, let me jump real quick to Suriname. Can you just give me your latest and greatest thoughts as far as – I know Hess made some noise about Liza a few weeks back. But can you just give me some color around that?
John J. Christmann - Apache Corp.: What I'll say is, number one, we completed our 3D shoot on Block 58, so we'll be looking at that. We'll get that seismic in full evaluation sometime next year. So we're excited about Block 58. It's right in the kitchen. We own it 100%. Block 53 we're partners in. we've got 45% of that. We have a commitment well that we're going to spud first quarter, the Kolibri #1. We're very excited about it. It's a very, very strong prospect. There are some follow-on prospects. And quite frankly, it's an exploration well, but it needs to be drilled, and we're very excited about it. But it's exploration, and it will be first quarter of 2017.
Operator: That's all the time for questions we have for today. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Clark for any closing remarks.
Gary T. Clark - Apache Corp.: Thank you all for joining us today. There were a number of you left in the queue, so if we didn't get to your question, please feel free to reach out to the IR team as always. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Brandi, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Gary T. Clark - Vice President-Investor Relations: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's second quarter of 2016 financial and operational results conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache CEO and President John Christmann and Executive Vice President CFO Steve Riney. Also joining us in the room is Tim Sullivan, Executive Vice President of Operations. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our second quarter financial and operational supplement. As discussed in our press release yesterday, Apache announced that during the second quarter of 2016, the company voluntarily changed its method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities from the full cost to the successful efforts method. All numbers discussed today will be stated under successful efforts unless otherwise noted. Please note the following documents will be available after the close of business today: our second quarter 10-Q filing; Form 8-K filings that include certain financial information from Apache's 2015 Form 10-K and first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q recast to reflect the retrospective application of the successful efforts method; and a successful efforts conversion PDF presentation which contains additional detailed information regarding the impact of this accounting change. Please reference our Investor Relations website at investor.apachecorp.com to access these documents. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. I will now turn the call over to John.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Apache continues to make great progress in all aspects of our business, as demonstrated by the strength of our second quarter results. Before we get into the details, I would like to start off by highlighting a few important takeaways from today's call. First, we delivered another solid quarter of adjusted earnings and operating cash flow. This underscores the significant progress we have made on costs and the resilience of our portfolio in a low price and low reinvestment environment. Second, we have been working all aspects of our cost structure for more than 18 months. Last year, the majority of our cost savings came from G&A reductions and capital efficiencies. While these costs continue to improve, we are now seeing most of our significant savings coming from LOE [Lease Operating Expenses]. Third, production volumes continue to hold up well and track in line with the increased guidance range we provided last quarter. Our production expectations for the full year remain unchanged. Finally, with our cost structure better synchronized with the lower oil price environment and with the potential for prices to exceed our $35 budget for the year, we can see a path to more normalized investment levels. Our conservative budgeting approach coupled with incremental cash flow in the second quarter now gives us the optionality to increase investment activity. Any incremental investment will continue to be made within the construct of our rigorous capital allocation process and within operating cash flow. Now I will turn to our second quarter results, focusing first on the positive results we are realizing from our cost-cutting initiatives. Apache continues to drive significant reductions to its cost structure. After an impressive first quarter, our lease operating expenses were down even further in the second quarter. Our operational teams have done an exceptional job attacking every aspect of LOE. For example, we have renegotiated power, chemical, and water handling contracts, in some cases locking in very attractive pricing for the long term. We have also significantly lowered our third-party contractor costs in the field as we further leverage the capabilities of our field personnel. On the G&A front, while most of the heavy lifting was done last year, we continue to identify additional opportunities to align overhead costs with projected activity levels. Importantly, we have retained the capacity to support much higher investment, so we do not anticipate these costs to revert. On the capital side, last quarter I noted an impressive decrease in our average well costs, which were down cumulatively about 45% compared to 2014. While we are seeing the rate of service price reductions begin to flatten out, we continue to find opportunities for overall well cost improvements. As we transition from strategic testing to development drilling operations, we will realize additional efficiencies and cost savings. For example, we will increase pad drilling operations, thereby enabling more efficient batch drilling and completions. We will drill longer laterals and reduce the number of future wellbores and associated costs. We will increase our utilization of rotary steerables, enabling better landing zone targeting and faster penetration rates. In addition, most of our rigs currently working in North America and the North Sea were contracted prior to 2015 at very high day rates. Consequently, we anticipate our average rig rates will decline in the future. Moving on to production for the quarter, as noted in this morning's press release, Apache's global pro forma production was 461,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, consisting of 282,000 BOEs per day in North America onshore and 179,000 BOE per day in international and offshore. North American onshore production declined roughly 16,000 BOEs per day from the first quarter. We only placed 20 new gross operated wells on production in North America during the second quarter, so these declines were expected. Notably, less than 5,600 BOEs per day of this decline was in the Permian, where Apache currently generates its highest North American margins. As set forth in our quarterly supplement, Apache's cash margins in the Permian averaged approximately $17 per BOE in the second quarter, which is more than double those in the rest of North America. Consequently, most of the volume reduction in North America had relatively little impact on our earnings and cash flow. Our Permian region produced 165,000 BOEs per day in the second quarter or nearly 60% of Apache's total North American onshore production. In the Delaware Basin, we placed only two gross operated wells on production, both of which targeted the Third Bone Spring formation in the Pecos Bend area. One very notable well which we mentioned in last quarter's call was the Blue Jay Unit 103H. This well was placed on production in April and achieved an exceptional 30-day average rate of nearly 3,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a lateral length of approximately 5,100 feet. In fact, in its first 90 days on production, the oil component alone of this well was 147,000 barrels, making it Apache's best well to date in the Delaware Basin. In our Waha area of the Delaware Basin, through drilling longer laterals and taking advantage of natural fracture systems, we continued to enhance production rates. This has significantly improved the economics at Waha and reduced our breakeven oil price. An example of our recent successes is the 905H well, which we placed on production just after the end of the second quarter. This well achieved a peak 24-hour IP rate of approximately 1,750 barrels of oil equivalent. As a result of our technical progress, we now have an expanding inventory of attractive locations at Waha in both the Wolfcamp A and Third Bone Spring formations. To sum up our opportunity in the Delaware Basin, in the Pecos Bend and Waha areas alone, we can support a multi-rig drilling program for several years. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform, and Northwest Shelf, we placed a combined 16 gross operated wells on production, which is down from 25 wells in the first quarter. During the second quarter, we brought online two Wolfcamp B wells, the Connell 38B 2HM and Connell 38C 2HM, each of which achieved a 30-day average rate of more than 1,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day from one-mile laterals. Subsequent to quarter end, we placed another strong Wolfcamp B well, the CC 4144 East 2HM, on production at a peak 24-hour IP rate of approximately 2,200 BOEs per day. Much of our testing in the Wolfcamp involves completions and landing zone optimization. The improvements we are making, as demonstrated by these wells, will significantly enhance our Wolfcamp program going forward. Also in the Midland Basin, we look toward bringing on three Lower Spraberry shale wells in the second half of this year, where we have significant running room and anticipate very compelling economics. Finally, on the Northwest Shelf, we placed nine horizontal Yeso wells on production during the quarter and continued to generate very good production rates and economics from this play. One noteworthy well, the Hummingbird #7, produced a 30-day average rate of 734 BOEs per day. As a reminder, our well costs in the Yeso play are very low, typically around $2.5 million. To sum up the Permian, Apache has made great strides during the downturn to improve every aspect of our business. Reduced drilling days, better landing zone targeting, optimized fracs, and many other efficiencies have all contributed to expanding our economic drilling opportunities. We look forward to continued improvements which will fully leverage the upside potential of our vast acreage position. Outside of the Permian, Apache had no active drilling rigs in North America and placed on production only two other operated wells, both of which were in the Woodford-SCOOP. We have limited activity planned in the SCOOP for the remainder of the year. However, Apache's 50,000-plus net acres in the play will underpin a profitable two or three rig drilling program for many years to come. Despite our low level of reinvestment, we are making great progress in North America. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, our North American onshore production guidance is tracking in line with our previous 2016 guidance range of 268,000 to 278,000 BOEs per day. On the international and offshore side, pro forma production for the quarter was 179,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, consisting of approximately 101,000 BOEs from Egypt, 71,000 BOEs from the North Sea, and 7,000 BOEs from the Gulf of Mexico. In Egypt, gross production of 350,000 BOEs per day was down modestly compared to the first quarter, due primarily to outages at a third-party gas plant. On a net basis, pro forma volumes declined sequentially by 2,800 BOEs per day, primarily due to the impact of improving Brent oil prices on the cost recovery mechanisms and our production sharing contracts. Apache placed 14 wells on production in Egypt during the second quarter and achieved a drilling success rate of 93%. In the North Sea, production was approximately 71,000 BOEs per day during the second quarter, up slightly from the first quarter. This was primarily the result of a few strong development wells brought into production around the end of the first quarter and improved operational uptime which more than offset the underlying base decline. Apache drilled two very notable development wells in the quarter. The BCR B81 in the Beryl field was placed on production in late June and achieved a peak 24-hour IP rate of 55 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. The LP7 well was also placed on production in June at a peak 24-hour IP rate of 46 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate North Sea production will be up modestly from the second quarter. The benefit of BCR and LP7 will be mostly offset by seasonal maintenance downtime. At our Aviat project in the Forties field, we have now completed and tied in the first well. As you will recall, Aviat enables a switch from diesel to natural gas as our primary source of power for the Forties field. This is an environmentally friendly project that will extend the economic life of Forties and reduce certain safety, cost, and reliability risks associated with bunkering diesel to our platforms. As highlighted in our November 2015 North Sea webcast, we are drilling two exploration prospects in the second half of 2016, Storr and Kinord. Both prospects offer low-cost tieback opportunities to our existing Beryl infrastructure and have material reserve potential. We expect to have results for both before year end. Since we have received many questions lately on Suriname, let me provide a brief update. On Block 53, we have completed an extensive geologic and 3-D geophysical review and prioritized a number of attractive prospects. We anticipate drilling our next exploratory well on the block in 2017. A drill ship has been contracted and preparations are underway. On Block 58, a 3D seismic shoot is in progress, and we will have an early look by the end of the year and have a fully processed data package in 2017. To sum up international and offshore, while activity was limited, we had very good development results in both Egypt and the North Sea during the second quarter. We remain on track to produce between 170,000 and 180,000 BOEs per day on a pro forma basis for the full year 2016. Both Egypt and the North Sea generated positive free cash flow in the first half of 2016, and we anticipate that we'll continue to do so for the remainder of the year. We are excited about the future exploration potential in our international and offshore portfolio and look forward to providing more details in the future. Now for a look into the second half of 2016 and our updated view on full-year capital guidance. As we mentioned in last quarter's call, our top priorities for incremental capital in 2016 are to increase investment activity in the Permian, keep two platform rigs operational in the North Sea, and to accelerate strategic testing initiatives across the portfolio. We have now initiated action of all of these priorities. In the Midland Basin, we added a second rig in late July and will focus on Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp B targets through the remainder of the year. In the North Sea, our two platform rigs will remain manned and focused on workovers and development drilling. Additionally, a considerable portion of our incremental capital will be directed toward accelerating strategic testing initiatives that will have minimal impact on 2016 production. As a result of the increased activity I just described, we now expect our 2016 North American capital spend to be at the high end of our $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion guidance. Importantly, we will not lose our capital discipline as activity increases, and we will continue to target unchanged or lower net debt at year end irrespective of changes in commodity price. Our incremental 2016 spending will have minimal impact on average 2016 production. However, this increased investment will help to stem our production decline and build momentum as we enter 2017. In closing, Apache has benefited from deliberate decisions to budget conservatively and to position the company for stability and success in a lower price environment. We have streamlined our asset base, significantly reduced our cost structure, and allocated a considerable percentage of our resources to strategic testing initiatives. Despite more than an 85% reduction in capital investment since 2014, we have high-graded our drilling inventory and substantially increased our opportunity set. I can say with confidence that despite the industry downturn, Apache has far more potential than we did just 18 months ago. We have protected our balance sheet and chosen to invest within our cash flows while maintaining our dividend and avoiding equity issuances. This approach has paid off, as we have maintained our investment-grade credit rating and reduced our net debt level by 38% since early 2015. Going forward, our budgeting approach will remain conservative and methodical. We will continue to manage oil and gas price volatility by setting a reasonable expected price band and gearing our capital spending, returns targets, and capital structure to the lower end of that band. Should realized prices come in higher, we will maintain the planning capability and operational flexibility to respond accordingly. This will help to ensure we generate the best possible returns on our drilling programs and maintain our strong financial position through the cycle. In the second half of 2016, our primary goals remain unchanged. We will live within our means, maintain our strong financial position, continue to build high-quality development inventory for the future, and invest to improve long-term returns and create shareholder value. I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney.
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I will cover several key topics. I will begin with Apache's switch from the full cost accounting method to successful efforts. I will lay out the rationale for the change and outline the primary differences between the two methodologies. Next, I will review our second quarter 2016 financial results as reported under successful efforts. I will contrast these with results that would have been reported under full cost. Please note that our quarterly financial and operational supplement contains a slide that compares key second quarter line items under successful efforts to the same items under full cost. I encourage you to review these comparisons to better understand the impact of the accounting change on our second quarter results. The full cost results outlined in the supplement are probably more comparable with analyst estimates for the quarter and should compare favorably to most expectations. Following that, I will review Apache's primary financial objectives for the remainder of 2016. And finally, I will update and expand our 2016 guidance. Our guidance will now be based on 2016 anticipated results under successful efforts. So let's begin with a discussion of our switch to the successful efforts accounting methodology. As many of you are aware, Apache has been evaluating a switch to successful efforts for several quarters. We have now effected that transition with our second quarter 2016 results. We decided to proceed with the change for two primary reasons. First, successful efforts provides for a better matching of costs incurred with the period in which they impact financial results. This is primarily accomplished through the recognition of exploration expense. Under full cost accounting, more costs tend to be capitalized onto the balance sheet and then depreciated over time. During periods of sustained low oil and gas prices, this typically results in significant ceiling test write-downs, as Apache experienced over the last 18 months. Successful efforts generally results in lower reported earnings and operating cash flows in the near term. But in the long run, the balance sheet and earnings are less impacted by commodity price volatility. Second, successful efforts is generally preferred by the investment community and is more commonly used by the vast majority of E&P companies. Nine out of the 11 companies in what we often refer to as our peer group currently utilize successful efforts. So this transition allows for more easily understood and more comparable financial results for Apache. Now let me touch briefly on the changes you will see under successful efforts. As I just indicated, one of the primary differences is that under successful efforts, we will report exploration expense. Exploration expense includes four significant categories of costs. First, it includes exploration-related seismic costs, which are differentiated from capitalized development-related seismic costs. Note, both exploration and development seismic activity are common at Apache. Second, it includes exploration-related G&A costs. Third, exploration expense includes lease rentals and the cost of any expired or surrendered leases associated with unproved acreage; and finally, dry hole costs, which will be expensed in the quarter in which an exploratory well is deemed to be uneconomic. Note, successful exploratory wells will be capitalized. Changes resulting from the recognition of exploration expense will have the following impacts on our reported financial results. On the income statement, results in the near term will appear lower under successful efforts due to the immediate recognition of exploration expense. For the second quarter of 2016, we recognized $91 million in exploration expense under successful efforts. These costs would have been capitalized under full cost. On the cash flow statement, net cash from operating activities results will be lower under successful efforts due to the exploration expense impact on net income. While the non-cash portion of exploration expense is added back to arrive at operating cash flow, the cash portion will remain as a reduction. There will be an equal and offsetting reduction in cash used in investing activities since these costs will no longer be capitalized. For the second quarter of 2016, the result was a $37 million reduction in reported operating cash flow and in cash used in investment activities. Net cash flow, of course, was the same under both methodologies. On the balance sheet, exploration expense results in less capitalized costs and therefore a lower carrying value for unproved property. The impact of the second quarter exploration expense resulted in a lower carrying value for unproved properties of $22 million. In the long run, exploration successes will transition to proved property with a lower carrying value, resulting in lower DD&A. At the end of my discussion, I will offer guidance on expected exploration expense for 2016. There are other differences between successful efforts and full cost accounting, such as capitalization of interest costs, impairment calculations, reporting of gain or loss on sales, and the treatment of assets held for sale. We don't have enough time to review all of those on this call. Accordingly, we will post a slide deck on our website at the end of the day that contains a more extensive comparison of full cost and successful efforts accounting methodologies as they relate to our financial reporting. Please feel free to reach out to Gary and his team with any questions as you work through the impacts of this change. You will see that we have included in the supplement a summary of the impacts of the switch to successful efforts on our second quarter reported results. It details what I have outlined today as well as a few other items, the most significant of which is the cumulative historical impact on Apache's balance sheet. The balance sheet now reflects the aggregate effect of successful efforts accounting from an historical perspective. You will note in particular that retained earnings has increased by $5.3 billion as of the end of the first quarter. This is the cumulative effect of many items, the most significant of which are: the recognition of past exploration expense, which reduces retained earnings by $8 billion; changes in past DD&A, ceiling test write-downs, and asset impairment charges, which increases retained earnings by $14.9 billion; changes to past reported gains or losses on asset sales that decreased retained earnings by $1 billion; and various other items, including adjustments to capitalized interest and changes in tax valuation allowances, which decreased retained earnings by $640 million. So let's now switch our successful efforts based financial results for the second quarter as announced in this morning's press release. Apache reported a second quarter GAAP loss of $244 million or $0.65 per common share. These results include a number of items outside of core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in their published earnings estimates. In the second quarter, items generally not considered part of core earnings totaled $145 million after tax. Apache's loss for the quarter when adjusted for these items was $99 million or $0.26 per share. Under full cost accounting, our adjusted earnings would have been a profit of $0.05 per share. Since market expectations for the quarter assumed full cost accounting, we believe this is a more comparable basis for assessing our results. During the second quarter, we generated cash from operating activities of $744 million, a substantial increase from our first quarter result. Improved commodity prices, disciplined cost control, and a release of cash from working capital drove this improvement. Under full cost accounting, cash from operating activities would have been $781 million. Apache ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash on hand. This is an increase of approximately $200 million from the end of the first quarter. After consuming cash in the first quarter, we are now rebuilding our cash position back toward the $1.5 billion we had to start the year. This is consistent with our goal to end 2016 with the same or lower net debt than we began the year with. Turning to costs, lease operating expenses in the second quarter were $7.38 per barrel of oil equivalent, down 4% from the first quarter, following a significant quarter-on-quarter reduction from the fourth quarter of 2015. We continue to focus aggressively on all forms of cost reduction, and LOE has shown a tremendous response to that focus so far in 2016. That said, our expectation is that LOE per barrel of oil equivalent will increase in the second half of 2016 due to the timing of workover activity and seasonal maintenance. On the G&A side, costs continued to decline as we align our overhead cost structure with anticipated future capital spending levels. As you will recall, for the purposes of monitoring progress made on our G&A costs, we define G&A as our gross overhead cash costs. This excludes incentive compensation as well as G&A cost recoveries from our partners. These two items tend to offset one another but will vary from year to year. Our goal for 2016 was to reduce these costs to a range of $650 million to $700 million. We are currently tracking at the low end of this range. G&A costs have historically been incurred such that 45% was capitalized, 20% went to LOE, and 35% was expensed. With significant changes to our G&A cost structure and elements of G&A now being reported as exploration expense, you should expect going forward that G&A costs will track more closely to 25% being capitalized, 15% to LOE, 10% to exploration expense, and 50% recorded as G&A on the income statement. Actual results will of course differ and will reflect quarterly fluctuations and the timing of costs. But this is a good general allocation to use on an annual basis. Apache's DD&A in the second quarter under successful efforts was $13.75 per barrel of oil equivalent. This is a modest increase relative to the first quarter as reported under full cost. This increase in DD&A is primarily attributable to an increase in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties resulting from the switch to successful efforts. Next, I would like to turn to our key financial objectives for the remainder of 2016. Apache has worked hard to build a strong financial position, and we like where we stand. We have a strong liquidity position with $1.2 billion of cash and $3.5 billion of available credit facility. We have a very reasonable level of debt, and we have maintained our investment-grade rating through the downturn. Equally important, we are running the business to be cash flow neutral at $35 oil. That being the case, we now have the possibility of higher cash flow in 2016 to the extent oil price averages above $35. We are in a unique position where we could fund an increase in capital investment with cash from operations. As always, incremental capital spending will be subject to a rigorous focus on long-term full-cycle rates of return. With this context, our key financial objectives for the second half of 2016 are to: continue to focus on cost management in all aspects of the business. We have accomplished a lot, but there is always more to do; allocate capital resources to the very best projects to enhance the quality of our drillable inventory and to deliver attractive fully burdened returns; balance capital spending with available cash flows to end the year with the same or lower net debt; and maintain our current investment-grade rating. I would like to conclude by updating our guidance for the remainder of 2016 and offering a few additional items that may be helpful in light of our switch to successful efforts. As John already noted, after raising production guidance with our first quarter results, our full-year production guidance ranges for both North America onshore and international and offshore remain unchanged. He also reviewed our increased activity levels and noted that we now expect full-year capital spending to be at the high end of our $1.4 billion to $1.8 million range. With regard to LOE, following our first quarter results, we reduced our 2016 LOE guidance from $9.50 to $9.25 per BOE. Given the continued excellent progress we have made during the second quarter but taking into account an expected increase in workover and seasonal maintenance expense, we now expect full-year LOE at $8.50 per BOE or lower. On G&A costs, we will continue to speak about this in terms of gross spend, regardless of where it shows up in our financial statements. As indicated previously, we are approaching the lower end of our guidance range of $650 million to $700 million. While we continue to focus on our overhead cost structure, our guidance will remain unchanged. With the change to successful efforts and recent write-downs of unproved properties, we anticipate expensing a higher percentage of our interest costs going forward. Accordingly, we forecast that approximately 90% of our total interest cost will be expensed in 2016. As noted previously, successful efforts requires the recognition of exploration expense each quarter. Exploration expense includes some items that are planned and predictable and other items that tend to be volatile from quarter to quarter. Specifically, dry hole costs and unproved property impairments by their nature do not lend themselves to guidance. Consequently, for the full year 2016, we anticipate exploration expense in aggregate will be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. This includes actual dry hole costs and unproved property impairments through the second quarter but excludes them for the second half of the year. Finally, with regard to taxes, as I noted on our call back in February, we anticipate minimal cash taxes will be paid in 2016. In conclusion, we are proud of our financial accomplishments over the past 18 months. Our liquidity is strong. Our debt levels are under control, and we are living within our means. We have completed the transition to successful efforts, which will enhance comparability with our peers and better inform our already rigorous planning and capital allocation processes. We look to the future with great optimism and have set our long-term sights on significantly improving returns on capital employed and generating competitive per share growth, which will be an outcome of disciplined returns-based investment decisions. I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons Piper Jaffray.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray: Thank you for taking my questions. John, on hedging, what are your latest thoughts there?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Pierce, we came into this downturn unhedged. And our best hedge was being able to reduce our activity levels, which we've done. We feel like we're living within cash flow. We're going to approach forward-looking prices in terms of budgeting around a band and then giving ourselves flexibility when prices range above that. So the plan at this point is we don't have a lot of plans for hedging. We want the exposure. And I think the big key has been we're making long-term decisions and long-term investments, and we need to be gearing our cost structure and overhead structure and investment criteria to where those prices are. We'll budget conservatively and then reap the benefits when things are above it.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray: Great. And then my follow-up is what are you doing differently with the Blue Jay well, the very strong well results there? Is there anything specific that you're doing differently now versus, say, a few months ago?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think it's just the culmination of the technical work that we've been doing in the area with specific targeting. We now have three zones in the Third Bone in that area. We've really gone in and I'll say specialized our completions. We're learning which zones, where we want to complete with all of the changes there. But it's just really the evolution of the process and the continuous improvement that we seek in every well we drill.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning – or I guess it's afternoon. John, when you start thinking about 2017 and assume a higher price deck, I'll just call it whatever, call it $50 – $55, how should we think about the Permian as far as allocation? I know that number bumped up a little bit this quarter, thinking about 2016. So how do you think about Permian allocations, and where would those rigs be focused within the Permian?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: At this point, we geared 2016 at $35. And at that level, we were not making very many development drilling choices in North America. You see with the little shift in capital, North America is getting the lion's share of that. The lion's share of that is going into our Permian operations. Clearly, at those types of price levels, Dave, we'd be looking at significant higher levels of investment. We're running a bunch of scenarios as we start to think about 2017. We'll come out with more color and more guidance like we typically do when we look at the fourth quarter call of this year as we start to think about 2017.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, and then let me follow up with the North Sea. You're talking about keeping two operated rigs – or platform rigs out there. Can you talk about what that looks like over the next six months?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It shows you that first and foremost, we're able to add a couple of platform rigs back into our plan in the North Sea. And truthfully, if you look at our international CapEx, it's going to be down from where we started initially the year, which is due to the efficiencies. So it shows you the progress we've been making on the international front as well. We felt like maintaining those two rigs is critical. We've got a lot of workovers and a lot of high-return projects that we can pursue, and it's not a lot of capital added back in for the back half of the year. So they compete very, very well, and a lot of low-hanging fruit that we'll go after.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Société Générale.
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC: Yes, hi. Thank you. John, in your prepared comments, you mentioned that your employees can support a much higher level of activity. Could you give us a sense of how high is high?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: John, the one thing we didn't want to do, we reduced our staff about 30% in 2015. And quite frankly, I think when we look at us today, we've got the ability to ramp up internally significantly from where we sit today. I think we could probably handle a $60 – $65 deck pretty easily. So we tried really hard. We've got a lot of employees we've made significant investments in, and we were very methodical and forward-thinking in terms of our staffing levels. So I feel really good about our internal head count. That's the one area we didn't want to get too aggressive and try to gear it to this lower side of the – the lower end of the price environment.
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks. My next one for me is on Suriname. I couldn't quite hear you. You shot seismic on Block 53 or Block 58?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We've got two blocks there. Block 53 we own 45% of. That seismic was shot prior. We have gone and we drilled a well last year and have gone in and fully evaluated that. We have a handful of prospects we're looking at. We have contracted a rig and anticipate drilling a well on Block 53 in very early 2017. Block 58, we are currently shooting seismic there now, and we own that block 100%.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, good afternoon. As you begin to ramp up CapEx a bit, you talked about the incremental going a little bit more for strategic testing versus development. Can you talk about how long the period would be where you'd be more focused on strategic testing versus development based on the inventory or opportunity to do those strategic tests? Or what oil price would you need to see where you would allocate meaningfully more capital towards the development side of the equation?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think the important thing, Brian, is we've got a lot of opportunity in our acreage position that we're excited about, and we have a lot of key wells that we want to drill. We want to get some of those wells drilled because knowing those results and those things will impact how you grade out your capital in the future, which projects you pursue, and also it comes into how you address the portfolio. So there's a lot of things out there. And quite frankly, we took a very balanced approach this year. We took a conservative approach. We budgeted $35. We scaled back significantly. That just slows down the rate at which we're moving through some things that are pretty important to us. Clearly, with prices averaging in the second quarter above $35, it's given us some cash flow. You see we put a rig out last month in the Midland Basin, which will be drilling some Midland Basin, Wolfcamp, and Lower Spraberry shale wells. So we're excited about that, and clearly we've got some areas where we're doing some additional testing. And I think we'll keep testing until we feel like we're in a position that we're ready to stop testing.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it, thanks. I guess it goes to the question of is $45 a good price for Apache or just a better price than $35 to accomplish both your delineation, development, and potentially in places like Suriname, exploration objectives? Or do you feel like you need the $50, $55, $60 to accomplish those objectives based on today's cost structure and how you see the balance sheet?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think the point there is, with the progress we've made on cost structure, we feel pretty good about even a $45 deck. If you go back to this year, and keep in mind our North American capital has not gone to development type projects to try to bring on volumes, at $45, if we budgeted $45 and added an additional $900 million of CapEx to North America this year, we would have kept North America flat, lived within our means, and we're already keeping our international flat. So I think the thing as we think into 2017, that number is going to be lower. Number one, our capital efficiencies are much, much better. They continue to get better. You see the progress we're making on the cost structure, the overhead structure, the LOE, the well costs. So our capital efficiency is actually – we continue to surprise ourselves with the progress we're making on the capital efficiency side. And then the other piece is, our base has come down a little bit as we've been less focused on growth and more focused on adjusting cost structure to where we can generate returns. So quite frankly, $45 would have been a pretty comfortable price for us this year, and I think that number would be lower in 2017.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.
John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good afternoon. When I'm thinking about the CapEx budget and through the new conversation on the higher end, can I still think about that when I'm looking at the implied oil price? Is it still okay to just say roughly, on an annualized basis, $400 million of incremental cash flow for every $5 improvement in the oil price?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think that's a pretty good number annualized.
John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, and then just one quick one. On the North Sea, last quarter you all had a good bit of the third-party plant and some pipeline outages, and I'm just curious. Did all of that get resolved, or did any of that spill into this quarter?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think we had a little bit. It was better this quarter. But I think we planned for a little bit more than in years past, but it's much better today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. My first question is a follow-up to Brian's macro question. John, you've been constructive on the oil outlook since February, and now you've begun a modest acceleration. So as it relates to Apache, what are your early thoughts on 2017 volumes on a low $50 oil price? And are you ready to join the emerging, growing low $50s club that seems to be emerging from earnings? And I guess secondly, given the tremendous costs and sequential improvements, any thoughts on what that means for your commodity outlook that have been pretty constructive since they've been pretty accurate as well?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The first thing I would say is we're going to be a member of the returns club, is the club we want to be focused in and focused on full cycle, full cost, fully burdened returns. And that's the club we're focused in. I think above $45 this year, you would have seen our volumes grow and been able to do that. So as I think about joining a $50 club, we probably already were in the $50 club. So we just haven't planned accordingly. We budgeted $35 this year, and you've seen us let a little bit of capital out. So I think the market today is more constructive than it's been, both on oil and natural gas. I think it got a little bit ahead of itself here in the last few months, and we've seen it come back as we went back and touched $40. I think we'll see what kind of price band we look at as we get into 2017. I don't see us departing from a conservative budgeting approach, gearing things to the low end of the band. And then we can always let a little bit out where we don't get ourselves in trouble in terms of spending out way beyond our means.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. My second question, your Bone Springs results have been very good. It's a smaller position there, Midland very attractive. We get the question on the depth of Apache's Tier 1 unconventional inventory. So any update or comments on the number of locations, percentage, or how you think about the amount that's economically attractive at a four-year or how you would classify as a Tier 1?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We haven't come out and really updated anything since the fall of 2014. And the approach has been we've been doing primarily strategic testing. We're not running a ton of rigs in North America. We were running 93 rigs in the fall of 2014, and we had four rigs for most of last quarter. I think at some point in the future as we start to turn more capital loose, we'll come out and talk more about some of those things. We feel good about our acreage. We feel good about our inventory. We've been building inventory. And the big deal is working the cost structure. And you see with the few number of rigs we're running, you see results getting significantly better. And that's a credit to all of our teams, the science they're applying, and the progress we're making. So we feel quite good about our inventory, our running room in a number of plays.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse.
Edward G. Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good afternoon. I guess you've allocated more capital to the Permian, and obviously that brings into question I guess non-core assets. You've got $7 billion of net debt, which could still be viewed as a bit high in a volatile oil price environment. So maybe talk through about disposals or the plans for Canada, the Mid-Continent, and the Gulf, an area which has not gotten as much capital together.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think right now we've been working on North American cost structure. And I'm thankful that we're not in the position that we're wholesale selling assets and that over the last 12 months in this low price environment. We moved some conventional assets in late 2014 when prices were high. We moved some South Louisiana assets in late 2014 when prices were high. We moved our LNG on a high price deck. So I feel real good about what we were able to sell. I think as we look at the portfolio, and it will continue to evolve. And as we continue to assess our inventory and look at that, we'll address some of those decisions over the next 24 months in the future. But I don't see right now is a time that you want to be trying to just sell assets and bring forward cash when we're not in a period where we're outspending or wanting to spend more and drive a lot of development in this low price environment either. But clearly, over the next 24 months, we'll continue to assess what the portfolio looks like and where we will be making those types of investments.
Edward G. Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And a lot of your debt has got great duration. There is some in the 2018 to 2024 timeframe. Any plans on aiming free cash flow to reduce that debt or asset disposals?
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks for throwing the finance guy a bone. So no, we are looking at possibly using some of the cash on hand to pay down some of the debt. I don't think we'll be going to any extreme amount. But if we could maybe pay down a little bit of debt as we end this year, maybe into next year, that wouldn't be a bad thing. I think you indicated we had a relatively high level of debt. I think our debt level is actually pretty comfortable right now. It could certainly be a little bit lower, yes. But with $1.2 billion of cash today and $3.5 billion of credit facility, I feel pretty comfortable with our debt level now. I might use some of the cash to pay down debt, especially in the short term. And in the meantime, I don't find that our debt level is what I would call burdensome, especially given the capital spending program that we have going on right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, good afternoon. Stephen, I wonder if I could throw you another bone. The LOE guidance, clearly tremendous cost progress you guys have made. How much of that would you say is going to be kept by Apache, assuming oil prices do go back up? I guess we're hearing the service companies are starting to chat a little bit about them needing some relief to some extent.
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Doug. We feel like the vast majority of our cost reductions, not just in LOE, but on the capital side and on the expense side, we feel like the vast majority of those are going to be cost reductions that we can retain. Sure, if oil prices go back up, when they go back up, there will be some pressures in some places. I'm sure John will want to weigh in on this question as well. But we feel like a lot of the actions that we've taken are really what we would call self-help type of things, changing the way we work, changing the way we do things, and both on the capital side and on the expense side. These are things that are not dependent upon the pricing from third parties. They're things that we do and the way that we work, and we feel like the vast majority of those are permanent. And a significant amount of these cost reductions have come in the onshore North America and in particular in the Permian Basin.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And the only thing I would add, Doug, is just a lot to our field folks. What we've got is workforce out there that's taken on the burden of doing things themselves, things that they might have contracted in the past, and it's that old Apache hard-core, low-cost mentality, where everybody realizes they can pitch in and save a few dollars here, and it adds up. And it's that mindset that I think that you've seen really come through in 2016.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: John, my follow up, if I may, is it seems from your prepared remarks that you're making some pretty good progress in your strategic review in terms of the initiatives and so on. Can you give us some idea where you stand then in terms of what you think is the identified inventory? Because clearly, you have a very large footprint, and I'm guessing that there's room for another portfolio high-grading exercise in North America somewhere down the line. If you could just give us some color on that, that would be great.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think the color we'll give you is we've been busy, and we're going to continue to be busy. We've had to go through a total reset in the business over the last 18 months. And the good news is we've made progress in all aspects of our portfolio. From Canada to our Mid-Continent to our Eagle Ford to our Permian, we've made progress in all of our projects, and we have a deep inventory. We also have a lot of key things that we're testing, which obviously could change the pecking order things. So we're working through all those things, Doug. I think as we start to make some decisions and conclude some of the testing and things that we're doing and start to talk about some of that, I think then that leads to what some of the follow-ons might be after that. But I'm excited about the progress that we're making across the entire portfolio and that all of our areas are doing a fantastic job. And we've got a lot of things that look very attractive with where prices are today and where cost structure has moved today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice & Company.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, John, and to the rest of your team there. I'd like to drill in a little bit more on your Midland Basin program, where you're putting that rig back to work, or where you've recently put that rig back to work. Could you talk a little bit about, in your prepared comments, you mentioned the CC 4144 East 2HM well that came on at 2,200 BOE a day. Could you talk about, is that also in the Powell-Miller area, and was it also a 5,000-foot lateral, or was it a longer lateral?
Timothy J. Sullivan - Executive Vice President – Operations Support: Charles, this is Tim Sullivan. That well was in the Powell field. It is a little bit longer. It's about a mile and a half lateral, and it's currently flowing at a rate of about 2,000 barrels a day and about 1,800 MCF per day as well. And in regard to the activity for that additional rig, second half activity in Midland will consist probably of about 17 wells, primarily focusing in the Wolfcamp and the Lower Spraberry shale. And where we will be drilling, again strategic testing in our three main fields at Wildfire, Azalea, and at Powell. And that should keep that rig busy for the remainder of 2016.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The thing I'd add to that, Charles, is we've been busy doing some swaps and some things too that have really cored up that acreage neutral, but have cored up our position where we really can drill more longer laterals now and less the shorter laterals. That's another thing that some of the progress that we've made while we haven't had rigs in the field.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it. And, John, that actually gets to where I was going to go with my follow-up. Should we expect more longer laterals? It sounds like yes. And are you also still testing your individual landing zones within those formations, or do you think that you've pretty much figured out where you want to go there and you're more testing completion concepts at this point? Can you give us a sense?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The answer to the first question is yes. You can anticipate longer laterals. That's one of the things we've been working on in our Midland basin portfolio. And then secondly, we're making progress, but there will still be some testing with this rig and some of these concepts. We've got a pretty good idea we'll be working some spacing tests as well as the zones and how you stack those zones across a section. And so we'll never stop testing.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our allotted time for today. Presenters, did you have any closing remarks?
Gary T. Clark - Vice President-Investor Relations: Yes, this is Gary Clark. For those of you that did not have an opportunity to ask a question, please feel free to follow up with myself or my team, and we'll be happy to get back and answer any remaining questions you have. Thank you all for joining us today and we'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Gary T. Clark - Vice President-Investor Relations: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corp.'s First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; and CFO, Steve Riney. Also joining us in the room is Tim Sullivan, Executive Vice President of Operations. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our quarterly earnings supplement, which summarizes key financial and operational data for the first quarter, along with details regarding our updated 2016 production outlook. Our earnings release and quarterly earnings supplement can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financials-reporting.aspx. I would like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. I will now turn the call over to John.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Gary. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. In the first quarter, Apache delivered solid operational results, strong financial performance, and notable drilling outcomes, all of which were supported by our relentless focus on continuous improvement and cost reductions. Today I would like to start with a brief recap of first quarter results, and an update to Apaches 2016 production guidance. I will then provide an operational overview with particular emphasis on some of the exceptional well-cost reductions we are achieving at our key North American onshore plays. I will conclude with thoughts on our current activity level and the potential for increasing capital investment in the near future. As noted in this morning's press release, companywide, pro forma production of 479,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was at the high end of our quarterly guidance range of 470,000 BOEs to 480,000 BOEs per day. Outperformance came primarily from North America onshore, which produced 298,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and exceeded our 290,000 to 295,000 BOE per day guidance range. Each of Apache's North American operating areas performed well, despite a significant reduction in capital. The Permian in particular delivered robust results with strong performance from the underlying base, coupled with solid contributions from both newly drilled wells and base maintenance projects. In light of first quarter production strength, we are raising our full-year 2016 North American onshore guidance range by 5,000 BOEs per day, to 268,000 BOEs to 278,000 BOEs per day. On the international and offshore side, pro forma production was 180,000 BOEs per day, which was at the low end of our guidance range of 180,000 BOEs to 185,000 BOEs per day. This is primarily attributable to unplanned third party plant and pipeline outages in the North Sea. We remain on track to achieve our full-year 2016 international and offshore guidance of 170,000 BOEs to 180,000 BOEs per day. As we have stated previously, our 2016 North American onshore drilling program is primarily focused on strategic testing and acreage delineation to build and high-grade inventory. Nevertheless, we are continuing to see some remarkable progress on drilling efficiencies. For example, in key areas of North America, where Apache was actively drilling during the first quarter, the average drilled and completed well costs were down approximately 45%, as compared to average well costs in 2014. On the expense side, continuing with our efforts from last year, we saw further reductions in both lease operating expenses and gross G&A. Looking ahead, we anticipate further benefits from aligning our cost with the scale of our business and the commodity price environment. As you will recall, Apache is targeting cash flow neutrality in 2016 under our current budget, which assumes flat $35 oil and $2.35 gas. As expected, we were not cash flow neutral in the first quarter; however, we do anticipate generating a net cash flow surplus through the remainder of the year. As such, we remain on track for unchanged or lower net debt levels at year end. Steve Riney will elaborate further on this in his prepared remarks. With the recent improvements in strip oil prices, we are prepared to increase capital spending but will refrain until we are confident cash flows have sustainably improved relative to our 2016 plan. Although we have the financial capacity to increase capital spending today, we believe that preserving our strong financial position and our credit quality through cash flow neutrality is the best approach for our shareholders in this price environment. I will provide more color on our thinking around this in a few minutes. Turning to our operations, in the Permian Basin, first quarter production held up well despite a significant decrease in the number of wells placed on production. We produced 171,000 BOE per day, which represents a 2% sequential decrease from the fourth quarter. In the Delaware, we placed five gross operated wells on production, primarily targeting Bone Spring formations in the Pecos Bend area. One very notable well, the Seagull 103-HR, produced an exceptional 30-day average peak rate of nearly 2,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a lateral length of approximately 4,600 feet. In its first 60 days of production, the Seagull 103-HR accumulated 78,000 barrels of oil, which makes it Apache's best well to date in the Delaware Basin. The success of the Seagull 103-HR is a function of our thorough understanding of the hydrocarbon system and continuous efforts to improve our results of these complex reservoirs. Thus far, our efforts in the Pecos Bend area of the Delaware have been focused on two primary landing zones in the Third Bone Spring formation. During the first quarter, we tested a promising new landing zone within the Third Bone Spring that could significantly enhance our running room in the area. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform, and Northwest Shelf, we placed 25 gross operated wells on production, which is approximately 40% fewer wells than in the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, Apache generated good results from six Wolfcamp wells in the Powell area, two Wolfcamp completions at Wildfire, and four horizontal Yeso wells on the Northwest Shelf, all of which are summarized in our quarterly earnings supplement. Before moving on to Egypt and the North Sea, I would like to highlight our North American well cost reduction efforts, which continue to exceed our expectations. Last quarter, I noted that we have dedicated a considerable amount of time, energy and resources toward reinvigorating Apache's strong culture of cost and returns discipline. This quarter, we are seeing some very tangible results from these initiatives which I would like to share with you. As I mentioned earlier, in key areas of North America where Apache was actively drilling, our average drilled and completed well costs were down approximately 45% in the first quarter compared to average 2014 levels. Notably in the Delaware Basin, our most recent well costs are now down approximately 60%. Although we have made great strides throughout 2015, I am truly amazed by the ongoing positive cost trends in our North American onshore drilling program. Six quarters into the downturn, we are still achieving significant quarter-on-quarter cost improvements. For example, in the Delaware Basin, we recently drilled and completed a Third Bone Spring well for $3.5 million. In the Midland Basin, one mile horizontal Wolfcamp and one-and-a-half mile Lower Spraberry drilling and completion costs are now projected to be less than $4 million and $4.5 million, respectively. In the horizontal Yeso play on the Northwest Shelf in the Permian, recent well costs are trending below $2.3 million. And in the Woodford SCOOP, our latest pacesetter well was drilled and completed for only $6.6 million. Achieving these lower well costs both expands our drillable inventory and significantly enhances our returns for future development programs. Recently, we received questions about the sustainability of our well cost improvements once demand for oilfield services begins to rebound. The high level answer is that more than 50% of our average well cost decrease since the 2014 peak has come from design and efficiency improvements and should therefore be viewed as permanent cost savings. In our earnings supplement this quarter, we have provided exhibits for our key North American onshore plays that highlight the breakdown between service price and efficiency improvements. Apache's cost achievements to date are more than just belt tightening efforts in response to the downturn. We seek to continuously implement structural changes and improvements which accrue to the bottom line and enhance our long term returns regardless of where oil prices and services costs go in the future. Now turning to our International operations, in the North Sea, first quarter production was slightly above 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which represents a 2% decline sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2015. Unplanned downtime associated with outages on the third-party operated Forties Pipeline system negatively impacted our sales volumes by approximately 1,700 BOEs per day during the quarter. These outages reduced our production uptime from what would have been 94% down to 90%. As a reminder, U.K. North Sea industry average production uptime has been between 60% and 70% over the last several years. Therefore, Apache maintains a significant competitive advantage in this regard. Despite the higher-than-expected downtime during the quarter, Apache still achieved exceptional LOE costs of approximately $11 per BOE. Our first quarter development drilling program in the North Sea delivered four successful new wells, all of which were placed online in the second half of the quarter. This set up a strong production rebound during the month of April. The nature of North Sea operations and production is such that there will always be monthly and quarterly lumpiness, but we are confident in our full year 2016 production guidance which we stated would decline slightly year-over-year from 2015 levels. Our subsea tieback of the Kaliter (11:46) discovery is proceeding on time and on budget, and we continue to expect this project will begin production in mid-2017. We are also looking forward to drilling our Storr and Kinord exploration prospects, which we highlighted in our North Sea webcast last November. In Egypt, our gross production of approximately 353,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was essentially flat with the fourth quarter. Steve will provide more color on Egypt production reporting in a few minutes, but excluding tax barrels and minority interests, pro forma production in Egypt was up slightly versus the fourth quarter. Apache's drilling program in Egypt continues to deliver successful and reliable results. We placed 23 wells on production during the first quarter and achieved a drilling success rate of 88%, which is in line with our historical success rates in Egypt. At our prolific Ptah and Berenice fields, we placed two more wells on production, bringing the total number of producing wells in the complex to 13. We have a few additional locations remaining to fully develop Ptah and Berenice, but facilities are currently constrained. Before I move on, I would like to leave you with a few high-level observations on Egypt. Apache's operation in Egypt remains stable. Our drilling, workover and water flood programs continue to deliver quarter after quarter. When compared to North America, our well costs are relatively low and our netbacks and margins are relatively high. And lastly, cash flow generation in Egypt demonstrates much less price-related volatility than North America, despite reported net production volatility from quarter-to-quarter. As we all contemplate the timing and magnitude of an oil price recovery, I want to leave you with a few key points around our thinking with regard to 2016 capital spending and the potential for incremental activity above our current plan. Cash flow is the governor on Apache's capital spending and activity levels in 2016. We still plan to manage to cash flow neutrality and exit the year with unchanged or lower net debt levels. We entered 2016 with an industry cost structure that was still out of sync with the low oil price environment. The recent rally in oil prices coupled with our cost reductions means that development drilling in North America is now generating acceptable returns in many areas. We believe these returns will continue to improve as costs come into better alignment with price. Recent improvements in oil prices are encouraging. We are now looking for a sustainably improved pricing structure that would generate the cash flow visibility for us to confidently increase our capital program. The potential timing and magnitude of this increase is the topic of significant planning and discussion right now at Apache and with our board. In the meantime, the vast majority of Apache's North America and onshore spending is focused on target testing, acreage evaluation and expanding our low-cost inventory locations to be exploited in an environment that offers higher returns. When the time is appropriate, our first priorities for increased investment will be to add development rigs in the Permian. We will also accelerate North American acreage testing, and we'll keep our two platform rigs running in the North Sea. Beyond that, the Woodford SCOOP play and Egypt are next in line for incremental capital. Importantly, Apache has maintained the organizational capacity and personnel to operate a significantly higher number of rigs and we are well prepared to ramp-up activity when appropriate. Lastly, we are very mindful of the fact that we are in a highly cyclical and highly capital-intensive business. As such, any ramp in investment activity will pass rigorous hurdles on returns and net present value. In closing, Apache's portfolio and capital allocation approach is designed to withstand volatility over the long term, which is evident in our results. We look forward to demonstrating the capability of our North American assets and efficiency of our capital allocation process in the next upturn. I want to reiterate what I stated on last quarter's earnings call; our plan is to emerge from this commodity price downturn with top-tier financial strength, a robust inventory of high rate of return drilling opportunities and a sustained capacity to generate free cash flow from our international assets in Egypt and the North Sea. We have made great progress in these efforts. Over the long term, our goal is to offer competitive debt adjusted per-share production, reserve and cash flow growth rates and to achieve a top quartile cost position in terms of average well cost, G&A, and LOE per BOE. We will accomplish this with an intense focus on long term, full-cycle returns for our investment programs. Through the cycle, we believe this will translate into significantly improved returns and an appreciation in our share price. I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney.
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, John, and good afternoon. In addition to reviewing our financial results for the first quarter of 2016, I would like to highlight our progress on several key financial objectives. These include continuing to aggressively drive down well costs, lease operating expense and G&A, achieving cash flow neutrality, inclusive of dividends under a flat $35 oil price, protecting our strong liquidity and financial position, and ending the year with unchanged or reduced net debt. Additionally, I will speak to our 2016 outlook for capital spending, LOE and G&A. And finally, I would like to review Egypt production volume reporting to address some potential confusion about the difference between reported volumes and the pro forma volumes we typically reference. So let's begin with the first quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported a loss of $489 million, or $1.29 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates, the most significant of which are ceiling test write downs. These items total $337 million after tax, in the first quarter and as in prior periods, resulted primarily from the continued low commodity price environment. Our loss for the quarter adjusted for these items, was $152 million, or $0.40 per share. As John mentioned, better than expected onshore North American production and solid operating cost performance worldwide, were key contributors to our first quarter, 2016 financial results. Apache's continuing focus on driving cost efficiencies resulted in capital spending of $466 million during the first quarter, which excludes non-controlling interest. This is well below our guidance range of $500 million to $550 million. Capital costs in all of our North American regions were lower than we budgeted, with Permian leading the way. Our capital spending guidance of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion for the full year of 2016 remains unchanged. We are clearly achieving better than expected capital efficiencies, thus absent an increase in planned activity, I would expect us to end the year somewhere in the bottom half of this range. That said, if the current oil price environment prevails, it's more likely that we will maintain or even increase drilling and completion activity from current levels, which would result in increased capital spending. Lease operating expenses in the first quarter were $7.81 per barrel of oil equivalent, 22% lower than the fourth quarter of 2015. Underlying improvement in this metric is primarily attributable to greater efficiency in North American onshore production and the timing of workovers and other expenditures in the Permian and North Sea. While we are very pleased with this cost performance, certain one-time items and timing issues benefited us in a way that will not continue through the year. Last quarter, we provided guidance that full year 2016 LOE per BOE would be roughly flat compared to full year 2015. This implied a target of approximately $9.50 per BOE. With the progress we have already seen this year, we now believe 2016 LOE will be closer to $9.25 per BOE. On the G&A side, total cost continue to decline as we remain diligently focused on aligning overhead with capital spending levels. Our goal for the year was to further reduce gross cash overhead costs to a range of $650 million to $700 million. We are currently tracking towards the low end of this range, and we continue finding opportunities to further reduce these costs. In the first quarter of 2016, recurring DD&A was $11.42 per BOE, 34% lower than the fourth quarter of 2015. Our DD&A costs over the last several quarters have been on a clear downward trend as the result of price-related asset write-downs. Lastly on costs, we incurred $90 million of net interest expense in the first quarter. You will note a trend of increasing expense interest and decreasing capitalized interest over the last several quarters. This is a result of unproved property impairments and reduce capital investment activity. Next I would like to make a few comments regarding our financial strength and liquidity position. In 2015, we worked very hard to strengthen our financial position and maintain our investment-grade credit rating with the three primary rating agencies. Having accomplished this, one of our key financial objectives is to protect this position by maintaining unchanged or even reduced net debt by year-end 2016. During the first quarter, cash uses exceeded sources by approximately $463 million. This was primarily the result of commodity realizations coming in below our plan, a front-end loaded capital program, and a build in working capital due to the timing of some nonrecurring working capital items. We anticipate these negative impacts early in the year will be more than offset later in the year. Even with this shortfall in first-quarter cash flows, we ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion in cash. In summary, our financial condition and liquidity remain very strong. We have created this position through disciplined capital spending and aggressive cost management rather than issuing equity, reducing the dividend or selling poor assets. Importantly, we still have good visibility to cash flow neutrality at our $35 plan level. Finally, I would like to take a moment to discuss Egypt production volume reporting. As you are aware, we most often refer you to pro forma production volumes which for Egypt, excludes two items, the one-third minority share of volumes attributable to our partner and tax barrels. Throughout 2014, and the first three quarters of 2015, our reported tax barrel production averaged approximately 26,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Asset impairments in the fourth quarter of 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016, combined with low oil prices, created a significant amount of noise in these tax barrel volumes. In the fourth quarter of 2015, these items resulted in negative tax barrel reported production of 47,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the first quarter of 2016, they resulted in Apache recording only 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production. As a reminder, tax barrels have no economic effect on our net cash flow from the business. Combined with the fact that they can lead to this type of reporting volatility, we believe investors should focus primarily on pro forma production in Egypt. A more thorough description of this will be on our website along with a brief history of the difference between Egypt reported and pro forma volumes. We have also included this information for your reference in this quarter's earnings supplement. In closing, we took great efforts over the past 18 months to position Apache prudently for a prolonged downturn. After successfully navigating the challenges that confronted the industry in 2015, Apache is well-prepared to capitalize on the opportunities that we believe will ultimately emerge. We have delivered a strong start to 2016 and look forward to continued progress throughout the year. Our primary goals for 2016 remain unchanged. We will live within our means, maintain our strong financial position, continue to build high-quality development inventory for the future, and invest to improve long-term returns and add shareholder value. While we remain conservative in our budgeting and planned activity, we are prepared to respond when the environment is right to increase investment. I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Congratulations on the cost reduction, really quite impressive. Quick question on cash. You've got $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet, so just wondering what's the optimal level? I mean, obviously, peers have done some of the things you said, like issue equity and sell assets to get to their cash balances high, and people expect oil prices may still be volatile.
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. Thanks, Ed. This is Steve. I think at this point in time, I don't know what the optimal amount of cash on the balance sheet is, but I kind of like at this point in time having $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. It's good for liquidity; I think it's a good time to have liquidity. It's a good time to have the cash ready for deployment, either in terms of paying down debt if we decide we need to do that, or for deployment into the capital program if we see the price scenario in the future improving. Or, for that matter, I am happy just to hold cash. We do believe that the cash balance will go back up to $1.5 billion by the end of this year, based on our plan for the year.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I guess a different way of asking it is there are obviously across the broad North American portfolio a lot of assets which potentially may be of interest to others, and as commodity prices lift their head a little bit, are you looking to be more aggressive on perhaps disposals of Tier 2?
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: The answer to that is we are always looking at the portfolio. We have done some small one-offs that are not really material to production. But at this point, we are always looking at our internal assets. We grade those against other things, we look at what could be added and what would add incremental value, but right now it's a pretty hard litmus test because of the types of projects we've deferred. So we sit on a pretty good set of assets, a really good deep inventory that we're very excited about, and we'll look how do we improve it going forward. But nothing major planned on either side.
Operator: Your next question will from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yes. Good morning. Nice quarter. A couple of questions, first I guess just on the horizontal Yeso. John, can you talk about what your plans are there, after seeing the results in the first quarter? What should we look for from that asset over the next few months or next few quarters, I guess?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, thanks, David. That is one of the areas that we've got inventory that we could put back to work. I mean, right now we do not have a rig that's over there. We've drilled some fantastic wells with, where the cost structure is moving now and when price has gone. That would be one of the areas that we could do, add some future activity to. But right now we don't have anything immediately planned to do, but we've got a lot of nice inventory.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then as a follow up, bigger picture, if I think about, last conference call you made the comment that you could have kept 2016 production flat at $45, obviously I think your service cost and efficiencies have improved since then. Can you talk about looking forward, either give us an apples-to-apples numbers for 2016 or kind of projecting the forward for 2017, what that range would look like?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I will take you back to what I said on the last call was, in 2016 another $900 million, which would have put our capital budget midpoint around 2.5, would have kept his flat in 2016. As we look at 2017, clearly we continue to make progress on the efficiency side, which would lower that. Our decline on our base is flattening, it's a function of, we're now 18 months into a slowdown in terms of the numbers of wells we've been bringing on, so that helps. Plus the base rate is a little lower that you have got to keep flat. So we see clearly less capital in 2017 to keep it flat, but it's kind of a moving target at this point. And then obviously the other factor is we've got some projects that we are advancing, Kaliter (29:28) in the North Sea is on track, which would give us a big kick in the middle of 2017. So it's going to be less, but it's pretty dynamic and we're in the middle of working through a planning process at this point. So at this point I'll just say it's going to be less than it would have been this year and you're right, $900 million or $45 base plan versus our $35 would have kept us neutral in 2016. But it will be a lower number for 2017.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons/Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. My first question, John, what is driving the steep decline in LOE, and then how sustainable are those cost declines?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, and I'll let Steve chime in, in a minute, a lot of its timing of how things came up first quarter. We had a big drop in a couple of areas. It is not something that will be there for the rest of the year, which is kind of why we moved our number down from $9.50 guidance to about $9.25, but we're making progress, and I've got confidence the guys can keep working on those numbers.
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, I'll just...
Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Yeah, go ahead. Sorry.
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes, just in echoing John's comments, we had good cost results in Egypt, in the Permian and the North Sea. All three have been very strong. I think there is a good mix of that that's just timing related, and you'll note that that kind of a reduction doesn't show up in the guidance reduction to $9.25 per BOE.
Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is given the improvement in commodity price, any updated thoughts on hedging?
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: At this point, the environment's getting much better. I mean, we like the direction on the cost, we like the direction on the oil price, so I think we're at a point where things are starting to look pretty darn attractive. But right now, our best hedge is we haven't committed to a lot of rigs or a big program at this point. So it's one of those things we will be discussing as we start to look at plans, but at this point, we're not quite where I would feel good about locking in a scenario.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Good afternoon to you, sorry. I appreciate all the color. I just wanted to make sure I understand the activity re-acceleration, which sounds closer. You accelerated around current levels, or are you looking for market fundamentals to clean up and then that acceleration will be governed, or the pace of that acceleration will be governed to remain cash flow neutral? Is that right?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean, I think the key is, Evan, we budgeted to be cash flow neutral this year at $35 and a $2.35 gas price. We're a little bit behind that in the first quarter on oil, we're behind it on gas. Clearly, in April we've seen a little bit of a rebound. So if the strip were to hold up, clearly we're going to be in a position to have some cash to deploy in the back half of the year, and those are the types of things we would look at. But there's lots of things out there. I mean, we've got debt we could address or the program. But the plan would be to – cash flow is going to be the governor, we plan to stay cash neutral, and we'll have some options to choose from if the current conditions hold.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. You also discussed your North American capital allocation in the recovery, but you didn't mention the Eagle Ford, which I had thought was a higher hurdle from your previous comments. Yet in Q1, you completed four Eagle Ford wells with competitive results. Can you discuss what the driver there was? Is that some science or lease-related activity?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we mentioned we'd been doing a lot of strategic testing. I mean, most of our North American capital is designed to that. We had some wells that were down that we wanted to complete and, you know, to be able to evaluate those. The Eagle Ford will require a little higher hurdle than some of the other plays. So as we start to think about in the future potentially putting capital back to work, right now it would not be the first place it would go. But we're seeing great progress in the Eagle Ford as well and have made a lot of progress over the last 18 months. So it's something I think can be an option in the future.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale. Please go ahead.
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC: Yeah, I had a question for you on the shales. Obviously, you've had a lot of improvement. How much capital have you really dedicated from the science side of things to better optimize, like density studies, things like that?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: John, I'd say if you look at our strategic testing, it really falls into several buckets, and I don't have an exact split on how much of it is in that portion of it, but we're doing three things, really. We're testing new acreage, we're testing new zones and then we're optimizing within zones. And if you look at our completions in the – a lot of the Permian as well as the Woodford or even the Eagle Ford, I mean, we're taking and integrating seismic data, core data, petrophysics, landing zones, everything. And so we're doing a lot of time on that, and I think that's where you're seeing some of the productivity things that are showing up from that time that we're taking to do things properly, and we've learned an awful lot.
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC: Okay. Next one for me, with the services companies, do you find that your conversations about future activity levels and costs are different? Is it more collegial, less adversarial, or...?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, I would say that really, since the fall of last year, it's become a lot more collaborative. I mean, we've had some really good sit-down discussions with some of the small service companies as well as some of the very big ones and have had some really, really constructive conversations on how do we lower the cost structure in North America, and a lot of progress on that front. And I think a willingness to recognize that that's what is going to take going forward. And you're seeing some of the fruits show up, not just in terms of cost reductions from the service side, but in terms of execution, efficiencies, structural things, a lot of these things that are going to be permanent. And that's what's important.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes, good afternoon. John, I was wondering if you could perhaps comment on some of the steps you're taking kind of to manage your base decline in the Permian? You had a pretty skinny sequential decline, right? So in addition to new drilling activity, what are you doing to manage that base?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean, I think one of the big things is we've stepped back. We've gone from trying to bring on a lot of wells and completing a lot of wells to really getting back to managing your base, and looking at fluid levels, looking at optimizing how we're producing these wells, changing some of the lift, it's amazing what you can do when you take the time. Compression, optimizing water shut offs, little things. And there's not a lot of money, but boy, it sure makes a big, big difference. I mean, we've got back in, cleaned out some injectors in some of our water floods, some of the old bread and butter, classic Apache things that we've done for decades.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC: John, I remember you commenting, maybe in a previous call, that you thought that your overall base decline rate was in the low 20% range? Any thoughts on that number, is it a coming down?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean, clearly, as we started the year, we said it was in the 25%, 26% range. As we bring on fewer wells, which is what we've done, it has flattened and is flattening. That's a good topic of discussion with me and our reservoir engineers, because we are always working on that. But clearly it is coming off and clearly in terms of flattening, and then also all these projects help too. So I think you'll see us continue to focus on that. It gets back to the quality of having some conventional, and a big chunk of our Permian is water floods and CO2 floods and things that just don't decline as rapidly. There's a lot of things you can do, scale cleanouts, all kinds of things, moving more water, there's just a lot – you have a lot more options to pull on your conventional asset base and you're seeing us pull those. So I think you will see it flatten.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just specifically on some North Sea activity, did the Storr and Kinord wells, did those move into this year? And if you could comment if changes in the PRT tax over there have changed your view on how active you get?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, I would say that the changes in the PRT are very helpful. It does not change where we are in terms of the game plan. I mean, we've got such a low cost structure there relative to the rest of the industry, and we're going to generate cash flow out of the North Sea, much like Egypt, on our international portfolio. So it does not change big picture the steps we're taking, but it does make things more attractive, and provides us incremental cash flow, it lets us do a few more things. We do plan to bring Storr and Kinord into the back half of this year at this point. So that would be – the plan would be to at least get the wells drilled at this back half of the year or could spill into next year.
Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thanks. And as my follow-up, turning to the Permian and really good results on that Seagull well. Could you give a little color on what you all might have done differently there and maybe a little bit of color, too, on that new zone within the Third Bone Spring that you're looking at?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean, the Seagull is a pretty – it's only a 4,600 foot lateral. It's really target testing and modification. As we continue to understand the hydrocarbon system, we're figuring out exactly where to land those wells and how to modify our fracs. And, Tim, do you have any color you want to add?
Timothy J. Sullivan - Executive Vice President – Operations Support: Yes, really, the results of the Seagull well incorporate the integration of the team, and that really takes into consideration the 3-D and targeting fracture intensity there. And it's had tremendous results and I think it's repeatable as we've just recently put a well online, or Bluejay 103, that's flowing over 2000 barrels of oil per day, very similar geologic environment.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Guys, I don't know if you could give this or not, but Egypt and the North Sea are your big cash cows in the portfolio. I wonder if you could give us an idea of what the operating cash and free cash flows out of those assets this quarter?
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, Doug. We typically don't give that type of information down to the asset level. You obviously can figure that out at the end of each year. We are thinking about some – potentially expanding our – both our guidance and our detailed reporting around things like that for the future. But we're not ready to start doing that at this point in time. I can tell you that both of those asset areas this year will be cash flow generators for us.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Were they free cash flow positive in Q1?
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Not going to say whether they were or not. I can say that they will be for the year, that's for sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good afternoon. On the Bluejay 103H that you just mentioned came on at over 2,000-barrels a day and also set a record and completed at $3.5 million, what were the specs on that well, like the lateral length?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's just a single mile lateral.
John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And then where specifically is it located in your position?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's our target one in the Third Bone Springs interval.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Yes, apologies, I'm going to keep going on the Bluejay and the Seagull, if I could. But if we put it in the wider context, you talked about design and efficiency gaining you in costs considerably since 2014. Has there been a step change there or is that a linear progression? And further to that, you mentioned the results at Bluejay were very strong. I was going to ask you if they were less than the Seagull, where you had such strong volume performance. Can we go – I guess what I'm driving at with the linear and the step is can we actually go a whole lot lower than that $3.5 million? Does it have a similar split between drilling and completion that we typically see? How much more do you think we can get out for less money? Is it a question of more volume, or can you actually even go less money? Thanks.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. I mean, when you look at – we put in the supplement a good bar chart that shows the steps in terms of how the costs have come down really over the last five or six quarters. So I continue to be amazed at what we can do. Obviously, there are certain things that, as you get lower and lower, it gets harder to keep having those sorts of reductions. I mean, I think $3.5 million for a mile-long lateral in the Delaware is pretty strong, especially with the type of productivity the well's come on. It tells you we're not cutting corners on the completion or anything like that. So, yeah, we'll clearly keep driving. The guys will tell you they can keep taking off small chunks, but how far – how much further can we go, I think that will be a function – we'll just have to wait and see what we can do. In terms of performance, it's going to end up being pretty similar to the Seagull. The 2,800 BOEs a day included gas, the 2,000. As Tim referenced, it's very early on the Bluejay, and that's just on the oil side. So I think it's going to be a pretty similar well before it's all said and done. But we'll have to wait and see.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, John, and to the rest of your team there. I'd like to go back to the question of the possible acceleration in the back half of 2016. I know you spent a lot of your prepared comments on this and you've already had a couple questions in Q&A here, but number of other companies have spoken about this decision, this kind of a – maybe being in two pieces. The first question is do you have the capacity to accelerate? And then the second would be do you have the appetite to or do you have the returns to? And I wonder if you could speak more to that second piece. I understand that you want to keep staying cash flow neutral on the year, but in this current environment, is $45 enough for – you would have the cash flow – but is it enough on the returns front on these plays to really entice you to up your rig count?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Charles, a couple of things. Number one, we've seen tremendous progress and now we've got a lot of wells with returns actually full cycle, fully burdened, look pretty darn good. So I think we've got plenty of inventory. If you go back a year ago, everybody started ramping up and adding rigs quickly and expecting prices to hold. And unfortunately, those that outspent significantly in anticipation of what I'll call visibility into more flat, longer sustainable price environment, ended up having to go back to the debt markets or the equity markets, that sort of thing. So I mean we're going to be cautious. We're going to be very thoughtful and disciplined. And like I said, we're going to want to see some cash flow accrue before we start putting things back to work. But we'll have a lot of conversations over the next couple of months and weeks, actually starting next week with the Board. A lot to talk about, and the nice thing is we have a lot of attractive options right now. We've also got a lot of things we want to test. And quite frankly as I look at the results and I look at the well cost, I'm glad I didn't outspend in some of the other quarters, because we've got wells that we didn't drill. I mean, we continue to make progress and we'll do things differently. So there's a fine line of feeling when we're ready to move forward. We clearly had the financial capacity to do so. The returns are starting to look pretty darn good, and it's a function of managing and balancing your financial structure.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful detail, John. And am I understanding you correctly that it's not just the level of the oil price, but you want to see it settle in there with less volatility? Is that am I hearing that correctly?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, no. We're going to have to be prepared to live in volatile bands. But I just want to see more visibility into more belief we're going to have the cash flow that's going to come with the price, and it's going to stay there a little bit, so.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Yes. Thanks. If I could, just a couple accounting-related questions for me. First, on Egypt, am I understanding it right, you basically had, on a recurring net income basis, about a $17 million loss, if I just back off the $54 million write down from the $71 million non-controlling interest? I'm just talking about the non-controlling interest side, that $17 million. And if that's right, I'm just trying to think through, what price level is that business net income breakeven?
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. Sorry, Michael. You're looking at what number for Egypt?
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: So, on the non-controlling interest side, the $71 million loss that was backed out, if you just adjust that for the $54 million write down in the adjustment, you get $17 million loss on that third of the business. Is that the right way to think about it? And if so, what price level brings net income to breakeven?
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. If you corrected that for the Egypt's non-controlling portion of the impairment in Egypt, you said.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Right. Exactly, yes. Is that the right way to think about it?
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes, so – and the question is what would it take to do what?
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: My question is, number one, is that right way to think about if that's the net income on that third of the business? And then number two, what price level would be required to drive a net income breakeven for that business?
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, okay. So I think that for the quarter, yes, that's a reasonable way to think about that. I think when you reduce operating results down to a single quarter, you're going to get lots of noise in that quarter. But for example I think we had a significant piece of noise on the revenue side in Egypt for the quarter to the tune of about $8 million on gas revenue side that we're in some dispute on, and we're looking at. I think that obviously the issue with the price that would breakeven, so how much lower can the price go to breakeven from an accounting perspective. I think that's obviously very difficult to do because of the cost sharing arrangement in the PSC. So I'm not really prepared to say how far down prices would have to go in order for that number to become zero. But suffice it to say, it would have to go down a bit more from where it is in the first quarter in order for that to happen.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Yes, that's what I was getting at, that's helpful. Maybe I'll follow up more offline. And then the other piece was just on the North Sea, again accounting-related, but the $27 million PRT refund, was that adjusted out of net income in that $55 million tax adjustment, or is that still in the net income line? Is that expected to recur, or any more of those coming this year?
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, it's not adjusted out of net income. It is a PRT refund because of, there are some costs related to prior year items. That's not an unusual type of thing to happen in the North Sea. We have that happen on a regular basis, we never adjust that out, whether it's a benefit to us or a detriment to us. We don't adjust it out for calculating adjusted earnings or adjusted EBITDA. It is – it's a large item this quarter relative to typical PRT simply because PRT is now approaching zero with the price environment that we have. But it's not – if you go back two or three years, you'll find PRT expense of nearly $300 million in some years.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Michael Rowe with Tudor Pickering Holt. Please go ahead.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. First question I have is on cash flow. You highlighted in your prepared remarks there was a big swing in working capital during the first quarter, as well as an excess of cash CapEx over accrual CapEx. So just to confirm, we should expect those items to reverse throughout the year so that you don't have any net debt additions, all else equal, according to the budget?
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That's right. So if we assume we don't pay down any debt this year, we expect to end closer to the $1.5 billion of cash where we started. We had about, a little over $450 million of cash consumption in the first quarter. Roughly two thirds of that, if you just take, if you look at first quarter actual versus the plan that it would take for the year to get to cash flow neutrality, of that $450 million, and about two thirds of that is because we built working capital in the first quarter and we had practically zero sale proceeds in the first quarter. We expect both of those items to be cash flow generators for us by the time we get to the end of the year. So, about two thirds of the $450 million is simply because of that. We had a pretty significant build in working capital during the quarter. The other one-third of the $450 million would be split roughly 50-50 between the overspend on capital in the year, versus kind of an average quarterly run rate for the year and the shortfall on revenues, less OpEx, because of the fact that prices were below our $35, $2.35 Henry Hub plan for the year. On the working capital side, I mean, so why did we build working capital in the first quarter? The primary reason for that is because of the pay down of payables and accrued costs between the end of the fourth quarter last year and the end of first quarter this year. And that's primarily because activity is slowing down so much, so our payables are coming down. Activity won't continue to slow down quite at the pace that it did through that timeframe, and we expect inventory and accounts receivables, which tend to lag a bit, the pay down of payables, those to also come down through the year. And then we've got some pretty significant unique items, if you will, on the working capital side that we expect late this year, probably in the fourth quarter. Those are primarily in the form of tax refunds on loss carrybacks that – one has been filed, one is about to be filed. And then also, we do anticipate some asset sales, which will also take place later this year, the proceeds of which will come in late in 2016. So all of those things combine to offset the $460 million cash deficit that we incurred in the first quarter.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Great. That's helpful.
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: A very longwinded way of saying, yes, we anticipate getting back to $1.5 billion cash with the same debt level by the end of this year.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the clarity there. And my second question, or follow-up, is you talked about adding capital potentially back to the Permian first if you got some stability on the oil price and felt good about the cost structure. But I was wondering if you all are comfortable allocating that towards strategic testing first, kind of like you're already doing this year, rather than full development or development drilling? Just curious on how you compare the capital efficiency between strategic testing and development drilling. Thanks.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Michael, in my prepared comments, we said obviously there would be some that went into the development side of Permian as well as some acceleration of some of the testing. And then also you've got a couple platform rigs in the North Sea that we'd like to keep active. And then you've got Egypt – projects in Egypt as well as the Woodford. So we look at what sets us up best for the future, and we look at the timing under which we want to go drill some development wells as well. So it'd be a balance, but you'd see some of it going to development potentially and then some of it would accelerate some testing.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks, John, and thanks for taking a call at this late hour. I'll be quick. Obviously, you've had some nice well results over the past several quarters in that Pecos Bend area. Roughly how much surface acres do you have there and how many estimated drilling locations, given the various targets, at this point?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The Pecos Bend area is a very small area that we've got, and we've been pretty active there. I think it shows you, it's a block of acreage that's less than 10,000 acres. And quite frankly, the other nice thing there is we have a high mineral interest. So we don't have many royalty owners we have to share anything with. But it just shows you the depth and the number of wells and so forth that we can continue to drill. We've got a good, I would say, probably 40 to 50 wells there easily that even the one zone would add.
Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.: Okay. And just staying that same theme, looking at some of your best areas in the Permian, I guess that would be Pecos Bend, Barnhart, Deadwood, Wild Flower, how much acreage in total is made up from all of those different areas?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean, the best thing I can do is point you back to our November 2014 Analyst Day where we broke the areas down. I mean, we've got 3.3 million gross acres in the Permian. We've got about 1.6 million to 1.7 million net. The four-county area we showed in the southern Midland Basin, we've got over 200,000 acres. That did not really include even the Audrian County stuff. So the best place to go look at those acreage counts would be going back to our analysts update from late 2014.
Operator: At this time I will turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Gary T. Clark - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Regina. Well, that's going to conclude the call the day. We've reached the top of the hour. We look forward to speaking with everybody on next quarter's call. If you have any follow ups, please call Christopher Cortez or myself. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Kim and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Gary Clark, Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference, sir.
Gary T. Clark - Vice President-Investor Relations: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann, and CFO, Steve Riney. Also joining us in the room is Tim Sullivan, Executive Vice President of Operations. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you've had the opportunity to review our quarterly earnings supplement, which summarizes key financial and operational data for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, along with details regarding our 2016 production and capital spending outlook. We have revised and streamlined the structure and content of our earnings supplement and believe you will find it more useful. Also, please note that we've changed our capital expenditure guidance convention to reflect a more comprehensive picture of our spending. Specifically, the 2016 capital spending range we provided in this morning's press release includes all exploration, development, gathering, transportation and processing expenditures. It also includes budgeted leasehold acquisition costs and capitalized interest and capitalized G&A. The only element of our 2016 program that our guidance will continue to exclude is capital attributable to our minority interest partner in Egypt. As a result of this guidance change, references made on today's call to 2015 and 2016 capital spending may not be directly comparable. Our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables, and non-GAAP reconciliations, along with our quarterly earnings supplement can all be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financial data. We also plan to post on our website a section which contains responses to any questions that arise on today's call for which we do not have readily available information to answer. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable explanations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to materially differ from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. And I would now like to turn the call over to John.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Think you, Gary. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to begin with a recap of the significant progress Apache made in 2015. I will then provide some highlights from our fourth quarter and full year results and conclude with some specific thoughts on what to expect for 2016. Apache underwent a significant transition in 2015. While the external environment remains challenging, we entered 2016 better positioned to operate and thrive in a lower-for-longer commodity price environment. In addition to completing an extensive refocusing of the portfolio, we have taken other decisive actions to position Apache for an extended low price environment, which included aligning our capital spending with cash flows, attacking the cost structure, continuing to high-grade and build an inventory of attractive opportunities that will deliver strong returns under a low oil price environment, and strengthening our financial position and liquidity. While we have made tremendous progress, we are not yet finished with these efforts. We streamlined our portfolio, exiting Argentina, Australia, much of the Gulf of Mexico and two world scale LNG projects. We are now focused on three principal areas, a substantial onshore North American acreage position with an abundant inventory of high-value growth opportunities, anchored by our extensive Permian footprint, and sustainable free cash flow generators in our higher cash margin North Sea and Egypt businesses, each with many years of low risk drilling opportunities and significant exploration potential still ahead. In the current low oil price environment, our more conventional international assets continue to generate strong cash flows and better rates of return than many of our operations in North America. In the North Sea, we are uniquely positioned. We have two large-scale hydrocarbon accumulations in Forties and Beryl, available high-quality platform and pipeline infrastructure and per unit cash operating costs that are one-half the industry average. These advantages make tiebacks to existing infrastructure very economic even at current oil prices. In Egypt, we benefit from the cost recovery aspect of our production-sharing contracts such that they help to mitigate the impact of declining oil prices on our cash flows. Our international positions clearly differentiate our portfolio, play to Apache's long-standing strengths and remain economically attractive in this low oil price environment. A year ago, Apache took more decisive action than many of our peers and reduced activity levels in pursuit of cash flow neutrality. We anticipated the lower-for-longer oil price scenario and recognized the importance of protecting value through more disciplined investment. Accordingly, we reduced capital by more than 60% in 2015 from 2014 levels and focused on bringing cost into alignment with the current oil price environment. Specifically, this time last year on our fourth quarter 2014 conference call, I stated that "We would consider using our balance sheet only to capitalize on lower acreage cost and other potential opportunities that may occur, rather than to drill wells and chase production in a depressed and volatile oil price environment". We stuck to that view throughout 2015 and continue to do so today one year later. At the same time, we instituted an even more rigorous capital allocation process through which we continually monitor the delivery of the capital programs and reallocate capital as value maximization demands. Motivated by the deteriorating oil price environment and a goal to achieve cash flow neutrality, we attacked our cost structure in 2015 with a thorough review of G&A, LOE and capital costs. Specifically, we rationalized our entire organizational structure, eliminating layers of management and consolidating office locations. And we reduced staffing levels to more closely align with forward-looking activity levels. As a result, today, our run rate gross G&A costs are more than 30% below where they were in the fourth quarter of 2014, and we're a much more streamlined and efficient organization. Our lease operating costs, on a per boe basis, were down approximately 10% year-over-year when excluding the tax barrel impact of our Egyptian impairment charges. Our lease operating costs, on a per boe basis, were down approximately 10% year over year when excluding the tax barrel impact of our Egyptian impairment charges. Our average drilled and completed well costs in North America were down 35% from fourth quarter of 2014 to fourth quarter of 2015. Furthermore, we strengthened our financial position and liquidity in 2015. A portion of our asset divestment proceeds were used to reduce debt by $2.5 billion and to build our cash balance. Apache began 2016 with approximately $5 billion of liquidity, including nearly $1.5 billion in cash. We value this position highly and we'll be very thoughtful in this price environment as to when and how we utilize it. One of our primary operational objectives both last year and in 2016 is to assess, refine, optimize and add to our extensive inventory of captured drilling locations in North America in the context of lower-for-longer oil prices. This is a comprehensive process that involves acreage delineation, wellbore redesign, completion optimization, spacing and landing zone tests, acreage swaps, purchases and sales and the creation of full field development plans. In addition to these activities, extensive science and testing continues on our new play concepts which could lead to significant growth opportunities down the road. The goal of this work is to fully define and prioritize the highest rate of return, highest growth and most efficient North American opportunities to leverage in a better investment environment. Apache is now very well positioned for whatever lies ahead. We are living within our means and anticipate being cash flow neutral in 2016 and beyond, until such time that the price environment warrants higher investment levels. We have a very competitive cost structure and continue to drive overhead, LOE and capital costs lower. We are building high-quality drilling and exploratory inventory for the future. We have the financial strength and liquidity to sustain us through a prolonged period of potentially lower oil prices and to propel us into a better investment environment. Our sound decisions and decisive actions in 2015 leave us much better positioned today. We have improved our financial position without raising equity and without reducing or eliminating the dividend. At this time, we plan to be cash flow neutral in 2016 and to invest primarily to enhance our long-term prospects for future growth. Maintaining strong credit quality through disciplined capital allocation is a prudent approach in this environment, thus we re targeting either unchanged or lower net debt levels by the end of this year. Now I'd like to turn to the fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. We are very pleased with our delivery around items that were within our control. We exceeded our production goals across all of our regions in both the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015. We accomplished this on a capital program of $3.6 billion, which was at the low-end of the original guidance range we established on our earnings call a year ago. During the fourth quarter, North America Onshore production averaged 308,000 boes per day, which, as expected, was a sequential increase from the third quarter production of 306,000 boes per day. The increase was primarily due to the timing of completions and solid well performance. In the Permian Basin, despite some fairly significant weather downtime in December, our fourth quarter production achieved an all-time quarterly high of 174,000 boes per day, up 2% sequentially from the third quarter. Growth was driven by the Delaware Basin, where we completed 13 new wells, primarily targeting the Bone Springs formation at Pecos Bend. In the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we completed 61 new wells and delivered very good results in the Wildfire area, with our first three lower Spraberry tests as well as three strong wells in the Wolfcamp on our June Tippett pad. We also drilled some excellent wells on the Northwest Shelf at our prolific Cedar Lake Yeso play. Please refer to our quarterly earnings supplement for details on some of these key wells. As we look ahead to 2016, our Permian rig count will fall from 10 at the beginning of January to four by mid-year. Permian well completions are expected to be down 75% year-over-year. These actions clearly demonstrate that we are willing to let our Permian production decline until we are in a better investment environment. Turning to the North Sea, volumes were approximately 72,000 boes per day in the fourth quarter, a 2% decline sequentially from third quarter production levels. We brought three new development wells online during the fourth quarter at very good rates, but these were offset by a maintenance turnaround at the Beryl Bravo platform. 2015 was an excellent year for Apache with the drill bit in the North Sea. We brought online 19 new development wells with an average drilling success rate of 83%. We also confirmed three significant new exploratory successes with the previously disclosed Callater or K, Corona and Seagull discoveries, which we expect will contribute very material reserve and production adds in the coming years. In 2016, we are significantly curtailing our North Sea development drilling program and plan to employ no platform rigs during the second half of the year. As a result, North Sea production will decline slightly in 2016 compared to 2015 production of just over 71,000 boes per day. In Egypt, gross production declined roughly 3% sequentially from the third quarter. Total liquids volumes declined 2%, while downtime and bottlenecks at certain gas processing facilities reduced our natural gas volumes by 5%. On a net basis, excluding Sinopec's minority interest and the effect of tax barrels, production actually increased 5% sequentially to 102,000 boes per day. This a function of the significant oil price decline from third quarter to fourth quarter, which resulted in Apache receiving more cost-recovery barrels under our production-sharing contract agreements. The key driver in Egypt during 2015 was the tremendous success of our drilling program and production ramp-up at Ptah and Berenice. As of year-end, we had 12 wells producing in these prolific low GOR oilfields. Since November 2014, Ptah and Berenice have produced more than 8 million barrels of oil. In 2016, we plan to stabilize gross production from these fields near 30,000 boes per day. Overall, our gross production volumes are expected to decline in Egypt this year. However, net volumes should increase as falling oil prices drive an increase in cost recovery barrels per our PSCs. On the cost side, I noted earlier that our average North American Onshore well costs were down approximately 35% from a year ago. We are continuously improving on this front and continue to see significant well cost decreases since the beginning of the year. Some of the key plays where we are seeing exceptionally low drilling and completion costs include: the Delaware Basin, where we have visibility to Bone Springs and Wolfcamp wells of approximately $4.5 million; the Midland Basin, where horizontal Wolfcamp and lower Spraberry wells are projected to be drilled and completed for less than $4 million; the horizontal Yeso play on the Northwest Shelf in the Permian, where our well costs are trending below $2.3 million; and the Woodford/SCOOP, where our latest pacesetter was drilled and completed for only $7.5 million. In 2015, we reinvigorated Apache's culture of cost and returns discipline. While we have made great progress on costs, they are not yet fully aligned with the current price environment. Further reductions are planned for 2016 and it is imperative that we remain relentless in our efforts to drive costs down further. To achieve this, we will foster innovation and utilize technology that redefines the cost structure of both Apache and the industry. The key takeaway is that these are not just belt-tightening efforts in response to price weakness. Apache is implementing structural changes that will continue to accrue to our bottom line, regardless of where oil prices and service costs go in the future. To that end, we believe that approximately one-half of the well cost reductions achieved over the past year are permanent, while the other half will fluctuate with future service cost changes. Regardless, Apache will always focus intently on controlling what we can control and remaining highly disciplined through the cycle. As we turn our focus to 2016, strip oil prices are now roughly 30% to 35% below where they were a year ago. This underscores the importance of continuing to foster a new mindset and approach to capital allocation and managing our cost structure. Similar to our approach in 2015, we are using a conservative price deck for 2016 budgeting that reduces the risk of inadvertently putting ourselves in the position of a material outspend and helps to sustain our credit quality. Our capital allocation process for 2016 is built around four key themes: living within our means and achieving cash flow neutrality for the year at $35 oil, focusing capital spending on protecting the asset base and optimizing and building inventory, maintaining a relentless focus on both capital costs and operational expenses and remaining flexible, opportunistic and ready to react as conditions change. With this in mind, we announced in this morning's press release a 2016 capital budget of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion, the midpoint of which represents over a 60% decrease from 2015 and over an 80% decrease from 2014 levels. In our North American Onshore portfolio, Apache is fortunate to have the vast majority of our high-value leasehold already held by production and only four rigs under longer-term higher day rate contracts. As a result, our obligation spending is relatively limited this year. At $35 oil, we do not believe spending on development wells and attempting to maintain production levels is a prudent or economic use of our precious capital dollars. We would rather leave those barrels in the ground and come back to them in a higher price environment or as drilling and completion costs become more aligned with oil prices. The majority of our capital spending in these onshore regions will focus on strategic testing and delineating our vast acreage position, such that we optimize our growth potential and efficiencies when it is appropriate to put more rigs back into the field. In light of these considerations, our capital allocation to North American Onshore plays is approximately $700 million or 45% of our total capital budget. At this level of investment, we anticipate a pro forma production decline of 12% to 15% in North America Onshore compared to 2015. Our decision to reduce North American Onshore investment by more than 70% and to allow production to decline in 2016 is simply due to our desire to preserve our financial position in the current investment environment. It is not indicative of our asset depth or quality. We are confident that our North American asset base can withstand this reduction in investment without any deterioration of the future opportunity set or impact our ability to arrest the decline and begin to grow again at the appropriate time in the future. To provide some context around the sustainability of our onshore North American asset base, we estimate that, in the current price environment, it would require a spending level of approximately $1.6 billion or an incremental $900 million of capital above our planned 2016 program in order to hold North America Onshore flat with the 2015 average of 309,000 boes per day. This $900 million dollars of incremental capital is roughly equivalent to the amount of incremental cash flow Apache generates annually with a $10 per barrel increase in oil prices. This implies, with an average oil price of $45 per barrel, Apache's North American production base could be held flat with 2015 levels. At current drilling and completion costs, this maintenance spend would equate to an incremental annual average program of approximately 20 rigs in North America. I mentioned earlier that Apache is looking for a better investment environment before we materially increase our capital program, let alone, consider outspending cash flow on an annual basis. We have the luxury of waiting for an environment in which oil prices and service costs are fully synchronized such that fully burdened and full-cycle economics in our North American drilling programs achieve double-digit rates of return. It is not enough to deliver the 15% to 30% unburdened wellhead returns at $35 per barrel oil that are routinely quoted in industry presentations. At Apache, we have elevated our standard for investment of shareholders' capital. Our drilling programs must deliver full-cycle fully burdened rates of return in the mid-to-high double-digits in order to deliver an acceptable return on capital employed for the shareholder. That said, we are thoroughly assessing our entire North American footprint and will be prepared to put rig lines back into each of the Pecos Bend, Evergreen and Waha areas of the Delaware Basin and our high rate of return horizontal Yeso play in the Northwest Shelf. We could add several incremental rigs in our Midland Basin, Wolfcamp and lower Spraberry plays, where we have 200,000-plus net acres in four core counties. Our Woodford/SCOOP position will support an incremental drilling program for several years to come, and we have numerous high-volume multi-well development pad locations ready to go in the Duvernay and Montney in Canada. When oil prices rally further, our Eagle Ford and Canyon Lime will come back into play and contribute to North American growth. On the international side, Egypt and the North Sea continue to deliver projects with solid rates of return and strong net present values. Because both are economically advantaged under our assumed $35 oil price, we are allocating approximately $800 million or 50% of our 2016 capital budget to these regions. We project pro forma production from our international and offshore regions this year will be relatively flat compared to 2015. The budget I just described is based on specific oil price and service cost assumptions. If oil prices recover or if average well costs decline such that our cash flow is higher than we have budgeted, we anticipate directing the majority of the incremental dollars to onshore North America. This could in turn mitigate a portion of the decline implied by our guidance. Before I conclude, I would like to outline some of Apache's potential future growth drivers as we look beyond 2016. With higher oil prices and access to more internally generated cash flow, our North American Onshore production will stabilize and return to growth. This growth will come from lower cost wells that generate better returns than Apache's historical North American programs. High-graded plays with years of running room across our 3.3 million gross legacy acres in the Permian will drive growth from the Bone Springs, Wolfcamp, lower Spraberry, Yeso and other formations. This would be supplemented by the Woodford/SCOOP, Montney and Duvernay post 2016. Additionally, we have acquired a substantial amount of relatively low cost acreage since early 2015 that could be incremental to the growth potential that resides in our legacy Permian and Anadarko positions. In the North Sea, we also see excellent growth potential. In mid-2017, we plan to bring our Callater Discovery online at a 30-day IP rate of approximately 15,000 boes per day, net to Apache. Following that, in mid-2018, we anticipate bringing online our first tertiary injectite discovery, Corona, at a rate of 5,000 to 10,000 boes per day net. Looking out a bit longer term, Corona has de-risked a string of exploration prospects that will be drilled in the future. Over this same timeframe, we will conduct exploration activities on our 2.3 gross million acres offshore Suriname. While it is still early, we're excited about the potential for this area, which lies in the newly confirmed oil province. We have included a map of our Suriname position in our quarterly earnings supplement for your information. In closing, Apache is well-prepared for a lower-for-even longer oil price environment. As experts debate when or if oil prices will increase and to what levels, Apache will continue to focus on the things we can control. Our primary strategic objectives in 2016 are: manage to cash flow neutrality after dividends and end the year with unchanged or lower net debt levels; preserve our strong financial position; protect our asset base; and optimize and expand our high-quality inventory of growth opportunities through strategic testing and exploration. Our goal is to emerge from this commodity price downturn with top-tier financial strength, a robust inventory of high rate of return drilling opportunities in North America and a sustained capacity to generate free cash flow from our international assets in Egypt and the North Sea. While we don't know when prices will recover, we do know that the prudent choices we're making today will enhance our long-term success. Quite often, it is during downturns like these that the choices companies make can either set them up for long-term success or set them back. I believe we have significantly strengthened Apache Corporation despite the challenging price environment and we are positioning ourselves to succeed through the recovery. I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney.
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, John, and good afternoon. As John indicated, Apache had a very good year in 2015. We made outstanding progress high-grading the portfolio, driving down costs, aligning capital programs with cash flows and proactively strengthening our financial position. We entered 2016 well-positioned for the challenges our industry will face. Today, I will highlight Apache's financial progress, which includes our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, progress with our ongoing cost reduction efforts, a review of our financial strength and liquidity, and our outlook for 2016 production and capital spending. So, let's begin with the fourth quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, under generally accepted accounting principles Apache reported a loss of $7.2 billion or $19.07 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published earnings estimates, the most significant of which are ceiling test write-downs, impairments and tax adjustments associated with these items. As in prior periods, these write-downs resulted from the continued low commodity price environment. Our loss for the quarter adjusted for these items was $24 million or $0.06 per share. Before I turn to other items, I'd like to comment on our reported production volumes, which include a significant downward adjustment related to the Egyptian tax barrels. The terms of our Egyptian PSCs provide that the payment of income taxes attributable to our entitlement will be made by EGPC from their share of production. We then gross up our results for these taxes which are paid on our behalf. Egyptian income taxes are calculated based on book income and are recorded as tax expense with an equal and offsetting amount in oil and gas revenues. Thus, there is no impact on net income as the revenues and tax expense we record each quarter offset one another. The revenue effect of this gross up is also recorded as production volume in our operating results. These are referred to as Egypt tax barrels. In the first three quarters of 2015, we recognized book income, tax expense and, thus, tax barrel production volumes. In the fourth quarter, we incurred a $1.3 billion charge related to impairments and write-downs in Egypt, driven by the continued fall in oil prices, which resulted in a significant loss for the quarter. This loss has the effect of offsetting nearly all of the previously reported tax expense and tax barrels in the first three quarters, thereby, resulting in a large negative income tax expense and negative tax barrel production in the fourth quarter. The total impact of the impairment is a loss of 38,280 barrels of oil equivalent per day of volumes in the fourth quarter or 9,649 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2015. Because the Egypt tax barrel volumes have no economic impact to Apache and, as we see in the fourth quarter, can fluctuate materially from quarter-to-quarter, our pro forma production guidance always excludes tax barrels. We believe this non-GAAP view of production is more reflective of underlying economic production volumes. Now, let me turn to capital expenditures and costs. In 2015, Apache's intense focus on driving internal efficiencies along with the significant downward pressure on third-party service costs resulted in substantial efficiency gains in both capital and operating costs. Capital spending came in at $678 million for the fourth quarter and $3.6 billion for the full year. This was at the low-end of our original guidance range. As a reminder, our 2015 capital spending guidance excluded capital attributable to our one-third partner in Egypt, capitalized interest, opportunistic leasehold purchases and capital associated with divested LNG and associated operations. As Gary noted at the outset of this call, we are changing our CapEx guidance convention in 2016. Our guidance now includes all anticipated capital spending categories, except capital attributable to our minority partner in Egypt. This should make it easier to track our capital spending plans for the year. On the lease operating expense side, our fourth quarter LOE was $10.04 per boe, which is 3% higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year, LOE average $9.49 per boe, which is 9% lower than 2014. Underlying improvement in these metrics is masked by the negative Egypt tax barrel volumes in the fourth quarter. On a like-for-like basis, excluding this impact, our lease operating expenses were down 4% and 10% per boe, respectively, in the fourth quarter and full year 2015. We have also spoken to you about progress on our G&A costs. As a reminder we consider G&A to be our gross cash expenditures for all costs above field operations. The stated goal was to exit 2015 with a G&A run rate of $700 million, a decrease of over 30% from our run rate in the fourth quarter of 2014. I'm happy to say we achieved this goal. As we look ahead to 2016 we continue to find overhead efficiencies and we are reducing our G&A cost estimate for this year to a range of $650 million to $700 million. Next, I would like to make a few comments regarding our financial strength and liquidity position. In 2015, we reduced our debt levels from year-end 2014 by $2.5 billion, ending the year with $8.8 billion of total debt. We retained $1.5 billion of cash, which we may utilize to further pay down debt. We ended the year with net debt of $7.3 billion. Our latest 12-month net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio as of December 31, 2015 was just under two times. Apache's nearest long-term debt maturity is in 2018 and only $700 million or 8% of our total debt portfolio matures prior to 2021. We restructured and refreshed our $3.5 billion credit facility, which now matures in June 2020, and combined with our cash position, we now have total liquidity of approximately $5 billion. At this time, our financial condition and liquidity are very strong, and we have accomplished this without issuing equity, without reducing the dividend and without selling core strategic assets. And to ensure that we sustain this strong position, we have chosen to reduce our capital spending this year to a level where we can attain cash flow neutrality at $35 oil. Both John and I have mentioned the term cash flow neutrality a few times in reference to our overarching goals, so let me be clear what we mean by this. Cash flow neutrality means the capital program, debt service and the dividend are all funded through cash from operations, with little or no underpinning from financing or portfolio actions. Cash from operations includes all operating costs, including corporate overhead, and includes movements in working capital. At this time, we anticipate only small, non-core, non-producing asset sales will be necessary to achieve cash flow neutrality in 2016 assuming $35 oil prices. We could choose to spend more capital. But as John outlined, we believe that preserving our strong financial position and our credit quality through cash flow neutrality is the best approach for our shareholders in this price environment. In the event prices improve during the year, we stand prepared to ramp-up our investment activity within the constraint of cash flow neutrality. Now I'd like to provide some more detail on our 2016 capital program. As John discussed, our budget of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion is the product of a $35 oil price assumption for the year. Since we are in a very volatile price environment and our overarching goal is for cash flow neutrality, the capital budget will flex up or down with price movements. Capital in 2016 will be allocated on a prioritized basis to protect the asset base, further optimize and build high-quality inventory for the future, conduct certain longer-cycle high-impact exploration activities and to pursue higher-return development activities which remain economically very attractive at these low prices. There are two types of spend required to protect the asset base. First, we have to maintain the assets and keep them running efficiently. This includes workovers, recompletions and maintenance, and will represent approximately 30% of our capital program. Second, in some places, we have to engage in activity to maintain ownership of the mineral rights or to preserve leases. This includes continuous drilling activity or lease-holding production maintenance and will represent approximately 5% of our capital program. We will allocate roughly 30% of our capital to key exploration activities and new play tests to continue building and high-grading our drilling inventory for the future. This will include continuing our highly successful North Sea exploration program, key play tests on some of our existing acreage in the Permian and Anadarko Basins and seismic commitments in offshore Suriname. The remaining 35% of our capital program will go to development activity. Most of this will be allocated to the North Sea and Egypt, where we continue to see development opportunities that work very well at low oil prices. This is primarily due to contract structures and tax regimes that provide favorable capital recovery mechanisms and higher average cash margins. We suggest our investors review our earnings supplement for additional detail regarding region-by-region netbacks. We also have a number of onshore North America drilling locations in the Permian Basin and Woodford/SCOOP that remain economically attractive. However, these areas will receive less allocated capital due to the capital budget being constrained by cash flow. While we have reduced development activity on these assets, the leases are preserved and development will ramp back up in these assets and several other areas when oil prices and costs are better aligned to deliver more attractive returns. Our reduced 2016 capital spending level is appropriate and prudent for a $35 oil environment. The end result is that we expect our total pro forma production to be in a range of 433,000 to 453,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This will represent a decline of 7% to 11% from a comparative pro forma volume of 486,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. These volumes exclude Egypt minority interest, Egypt tax barrels and the effect of divested volumes from the 2015 base. If prices rise allowing more capital to be deployed, we anticipate most incremental investment would be directed to onshore North America and this would offset some of this anticipated decline. In 2016 we will continue to optimize LOE, but given our expected production decline and a mix shift to slightly higher-cost international production, we do not anticipate materially lower operating costs on a per barrel of oil equivalent basis. In terms of 2016 income taxes, we expect our adjusted earnings global effective tax rate to currently be in a range of 15% to 20%. Obviously, lower than what we would typically expect, our effective tax rate is being driven primarily by an expectation of very low book income. Going forward, we will be able to provide updates to this rate as the year progresses. Also, we can provide some guidance around expected cash tax payments. We will pay the remainder of the income tax accrued for repatriating 2015 foreign sales proceeds of $85 million in the first quarter. Given the low commodity price environment, we currently believe that our cash tax payments in 2016, including cash taxes associated with the Petroleum Revenue Tax in the UK, will be minimal. For the first quarter, we are providing pro forma production guidance for North American onshore of 290,000 to 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our international and offshore production is guided to 180,000 to 185,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which excludes Egypt tax barrels and the Egypt minority interest. Our projected capital spend in the first quarter is $500 million to $550 million, or approximately one-third of our full-year 2016 budget. In closing, our prudent approach in 2015 has put us on firm ground and helps ensure resiliency in this difficult and unpredictable environment. As a result, we are prepared to endure a potentially lower for even longer commodity cycle while retaining our ability to dynamically manage our activity levels up or down as commodity prices and service costs dictate. Through all of this, our primary goals will remain unchanged. We will live within our means, maintain our strong financial position, build quality development inventory for the future and invest to improve returns and grow value for our shareholders. We look forward to a successful 2016. And I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: And your first question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company. Your line is open.
Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International: Good afternoon. John, does the Egyptian government help drive your thinking regarding capital allocation among your different regions? I assume the Egyptian government wants you to produce as much oil and gas as possible to bolster both domestic energy security as well as the Egyptian treasury. And so just curious if it limits your capital allocation flexibility in any ways.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Pearce, clearly they would like us to invest more money, but like everything else, we decide where we put the investments in place, so it has not had an impact. We are going to generate cash flow in both Egypt and the North Sea, and they understand that. And it obviously will flow with our budget as we're flexible.
Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International: Great. And then my follow-up around the offshore Suriname blocks, if this is a legacy position from when Apache had a more defined exploration program like in New Zealand, Cook Inlet and places like that, is this a bit more of a one-off or is this a type of business that you want to build over the next few years?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think it is something – it fits with our international portfolio. Actually, we've got a lot of questions about that position, Pearce. We felt like it was important to go ahead and get a map out there. We drilled the well this year, our Popokai well, and we actually had picked up the other block prior to either Exxon drilling there Liza well or our well going down. So, we've got those two blocks there, not a huge capital commitment. We're going to be shooting seismic over block 58 this year, and we'll go from there.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good afternoon.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hello, Brian.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: With regards to the CapEx and activity reductions, when we think about your cost base and your lowered cost, including on the SG&A side, when it's time to ramp back up, what is your operational and scale flexibility to do this? And what flexibility, if any, may be reduced, at least, temporarily? I mean, in other words, if you wanted to take the Permian and bring it back to a 10 or 15 or 20 rig count again, would this require re-staffing and the passage of time to make that happen?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Brian, with the way we've done our staffing, we strategically designed this organization for a $50 plus world. So, we do not envision needing to add a lot of staff to be able to flex back up. Clearly, I think if you get into a significantly lower time period where you've got lower prices, 24 months, 36 months out at that point you'd probably reduce further. But, we've maintained the flexibility so we can ramp up our capital programs when appropriate.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks so much. My follow-up is actually a follow-up to Pearce's question on exploration. You made a couple of references to adding exploration opportunities. Was that specifically the Suriname reference that you've already kind of spoken to here or are there other opportunities including the onshore that you're pursuing from a more exploratory perspective? And can you give us more color beyond Suriname if the answer is yes to that?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean, it obviously includes Suriname. We did a good job of highlighting our North Sea exploration program last November, so we've got some exploration wells to drill in the North Sea. We brought on two discoveries late-2014 in Egypt in Ptah and Berenice, so we have active exploration programs both North Sea, both Egypt, Suriname and then obviously in North America. We have acknowledged that we acquired some acreage last year at some low prices that we think can be prospective. And while we've shut down for the most part our development drilling in North America, we will be doing some strategic testing in and around our existing asset base, and on some acreage that we've picked up.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. I appreciate the color and added disclosure. My first question, you guys cut CapEx, I think, deeper than expectations to get within cash flow post-dividend and avoided, at least, so far, some moves made by peers. And maybe you alluded to this in your opening comments. Yet to be clear, on the strip, do think that these moves mitigate the risk of needing to issue equity or losing your IG rating at Moody's?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Clearly, at this point, we took actions and we're very aggressive last year. So you look back to 2015 and 2016, we've had a track record of reducing activity and really trying to gear our business and mirror our activities to the price environment we're in. We've done that, we worked hard last year to improve our financial position, which we demonstrated we did. If you look back over second quarter, third quarter of last year we had an outspend of approximately 14% which was significantly lower than most of our peer group. So it put us in a position where we have been working to gear our spending levels to a lower price environment. So, clearly, we worked on that, and we do have cash on hand this year. Obviously, we're making a conscious decision again in 2016 to live within the current price environment and within cash flow here such that we end the year with flat net debt. So it puts us in a position where we would anticipate not having to do some of those things at this point. And obviously protecting our investment grade rating is important to us, and it's something that we take seriously.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And I guess – go ahead. Sorry. Oh, that's me echoing. Sorry. I, in my second question, follow-up, I mean, while not the case currently on your credit rating, but how should we or how do you think about potential impact to operations inside, outside the U.S. working capital levels if you either did see one or more non-IG credit rating?
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Thanks, Evan. So, this is Steve. We're not going to really deal with the types of hypotheticals of what would happen if this happen, what would you do if the credit rating went down multiple notches. We're doing everything that we can to prudently run the company financially as John outlined. We've taken a number of steps to protect the financial position of the company. And we think we're actually in pretty good shape. We've done a lot of stuff in 2015 in the last year to strengthen the financial position, build liquidity, make sure that we don't have a lot of refinance risk. And so, S&P has already come out with their rating, BBB, a downgrade to BBB and stable. Fitch continues to have us at BBB+, and we're waiting on Moody's. And I think we've done the things that we need to do and we'll continue to do the things that we need to do to remain investment grade. And we've got $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. And if we need to use some of that, as I said in my script, to pay down a little bit of debt in order to protect that, then we would certainly be willing to do that. So, we obviously think about what we would do and what we would be required to do because we need to be prepared and prudent about that. We don't spend a lot of time worried about that. We worry about protecting the investment grade rating.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Société Générale. Your line is open.
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC: Two quick ones. For Suriname, when will you get the bird stack in on the seismic?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: John, we will be shooting that later this year. So, it will be a summer program.
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, John. With respect to your unconventional activity that you have planned, is this all going to be internal science done by Apache or are you going to be interfacing with the industry or what?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Clearly, it'd be internal programs that we'd be doing on our own. So, I mean, we participate in some wells in some areas and we learn from what we can and we've got partners in some places, but clearly, the work we are doing is all internally generated, and for the most part, it's done on our behalf for 100%.
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC: Okay. Last one for me. Historically, you've made a lot of acquisitions; not of late, but a lot of people are experiencing some pain. Will you be more opportunistic in terms of property front in terms of buying things beyond what you have done?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I mean, John, we always are aware of what's out there and look at things carefully. The thing I would say, we find ourselves today in a very enviable position and we're opportunity-rich. With where we've scaled our capital back, there are a lot of excellent opportunities that we are choosing not to fund and that we think we would pursue at a higher price environment. So, as we think about things, they would have to be something that would be incrementally additive to our current inventory and portfolio. And so, I mean, it'd be a pretty high bar to be able to – something that we would want to bring into the door.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy. Your line is open.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Thanks. Was just curious going back to Egypt a little bit, is there anything – any feature within the PSC that kind of limits your downside flexibility around spending? I'm just trying to think through if there's any sort of reduced cost-recovery barrels or anything along those lines if you cut too much.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, Michael, there really isn't. The nice thing about what you're seeing on the international portfolio is a lot of these PSCs and so forth were designed for lower price environments. And quite frankly, the way they work, the government takes a greater percentage in higher prices. And so, as we look at the international portfolio and we look at North America, there's greater leverage in North America to higher prices, and there's less leverage on the international side. So it makes sense to allocate more capital into those projects right now because the returns are superior. And there's no requirements or commitments on the spend level that would cause us to have to spend more or anything along those lines.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate the color. And North America, if I just think about the 2015 fourth quarter rate and then take a linear decline through 2016, I'm showing about 20% plus decline year-on-year 4Q 2016 versus 4Q 2015, is that directionally reasonable or is that anything I ought to revise in that thinking?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I would say you'd probably end up a little bit steeper on the backside, but it's all going to hinge on how flexible we are with the capital and prices.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning or I guess afternoon. John, I'm just trying to think about 2017. If you think about it, if you get a modest uptick, obviously, cash flow, you guys have a lot of leverage to that. Your cash flow goes up. How are you thinking about the next two years? Is it spend within cash flow? Is it – it obviously would take a little bit of time to ramp to get there, but how would you thinking about that in, say, a $45 world?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think the important thing is if you look at 2016, we're guiding to relatively flat international. We said earlier on the call in the prepared notes that an additional $900 million incremental capital in North America would keep North America flat to slightly growing, which translates to about a $45 world. So 2016, we could live within cash flow and be flat to relatively slight growth. So, as we look ahead into 2017, there's a couple of things going on first and foremost. We're in the second year now of a significantly reduced CapEx budget. We reduced aggressively last year, again this year. So we've got fewer wells that were brought on than historical. So our rates will be flattening slightly as we go into 2017. Secondly, it will not take as much capital in 2017 to keep it flat, especially with North America. We're already investing at levels right now on the international side. Additionally, we've got some catalysts that will be coming on in 2017. If you look at the North Sea, our Callater well, potentially more than one well there that could be coming on. So, we've got some catalysts. And quite frankly, with the capital efficiency we're seeing, the other thing I'll say is, as we look at the 2016 budget, we've already seen well costs coming in significantly under what we planned this year. So the capital efficiency is the other big thing. So, I think as we get out into 2017, it's going to take a lower oil price for us to be able to stay flat and potentially grow.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then one follow-up, just to clarify. So you said that you're going to have four rigs in the Permian or that's where you get to. Where – maybe one or two of those doing some R&D, can you talk about where the activity is going to be?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We've got four long-term contracts, so we will ramp down to those four rigs. There'll be a couple of them working in the Delaware, two to three. And there will be at least one up in the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform as we continue to test all of our plays.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good afternoon and thank you very much for talking about returns and fully-loaded returns at that. So as we go out on the other side of this trough, however long it lasts, what is the hurdle rate for investment fully-loaded that you're looking to develop? I appreciate oil price is going to move, the cost structure is going to change, but I'm trying to think about what hurdle rate gets you to invest.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think the key is we want to get to fully burdened corporate returns that are in the low-double digits. And I think that's where we need to be striving and that's where we plan to get to.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yes. Good that you have a returns target because historically the returns have not been as good for the industry even at $100 oil. Just a question then on the Permian and Delaware. You've got acreage, but it's not all contiguous. I'm just wondering if there's any update on people being willing to block up to get some efficiency gains?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The nice thing is we've got 3.3 million gross acres, so we've got lots of acreage. We have done a lot of small trades and we are doing a lot of things. We are trying to block some things up and have had some success. So they're not things that hit the press in terms of radar screen, but we're continually looking to block and swap. We're interbedded with a lot of the operators and there's lots of things we're doing to try to core up those positions and put together drilling units where you've got more control.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Bob Morris with Citi. Your line is open.
Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. John, on the four rigs at mid-year in the Permian, will you have a rig running in the Woodford/SCOOP or anywhere else, or will it be just those four?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: At this point we've got flexibility there, Bob, but I would anticipate those being in the Permian.
Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then on the drilled but uncompleted inventory, how will that trend through the year? Do you have an inventory starting out the year, will that be drawn down or how will that contribute to the production during the year?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: If you look at last year, we consumed about 70 horizontal drilled but uncompleted wells and about 50 vertical. As I was pretty vocal early last year the wells we drill we intended to complete, and we drew down a lot of our DUCs. I would envision us doing the same thing this year. You could see that number come down a little bit, but it's at a level now where we don't have a lot that we haven't already completed. And the thing I'll add, too, is we have the luxury of not having a lot of rig contracts and a lot of leases that require drilling of wells right now. So we're not in a position where we're having to build DUCs because we don't think that's a prudent use of capital.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. John, I wondered if I could try two, please. I don't know if I missed this, but could you give us some idea of exit rate to exit rate in North America Q4 to Q4 2016 just to give us an idea where you're going be running at going into next year?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Doug, we did not give any guidance around that specific. I would say probably the best thing to do is take – we gave first quarter guidance, we gave the average ranges for the year and I would just probably extrapolate from that. I will say going into 2017, we expect to see capital efficiencies and things come into play where we have a much better picture for 2017 than we do currently for 2016 at these capital levels.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. I can join the dots. If I may, I want to go back to Suriname from the earlier question. And I'm just trying to understand a little bit about what's going on there with your longer-term thinking. Are you getting carried, John, on the activities there? And I'm just wondering are you retaining this really more as an option in case (1:01:04) spills over into your block? Or is that a little bit more strategic that this is really something that would be a core part of your portfolio going forward? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, what I'll say is when we originally took the block several years ago, the first block, 53, we viewed it as being in a very potential prospective area. I think what you now see is you've got a proven oil hydrocarbon province. We've got two blocks that are centrally located. There is a system there. We did drill one well last year. Prior to drilling that well, we did bring in partners and were promoted on the one well in Block 53. We picked up Block 58 on our own just as protection. It was not a huge commitment. And I think we now have the luxury to see what we do with it. It is a bid option. We own it 100%. And clearly it's an area that's very prospective and is getting a lot of attention.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: The strategic allocation of capital, could you contrast what you call a development CapEx versus a base maintenance CapEx, say, in the Permian? And what does strategic capital mean in that exploration bucket?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think first and foremost in terms of maintenance, there are just certain things you have to do on your existing fields. So basically, Bob, we're not drilling development wells in the Permian which would be to generate further growth. So that's going to be the difference. The other thing is going to be just your bread-and-butter maintenance things that you do with your base. And that's repairing subs, doing those types of things. In terms of strategic capital, we would put that as things that potentially sets up new drilling programs, test new zones, test new concepts, helps us better define what are going to be the inventory of growth opportunities in the future.
Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So testing stacked pay on an existing development you'd throw-in on the strategic side?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: If it had running room and could open up something significant, then yes. If it's something small on the Central Basin Platform or some areas where we've got just a few locations identified, then it wouldn't be in that category.
Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. I think that's clear.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It'd have to have potential scope to it for it to be strategic.
Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Mike Kelly with Seaport Global. Your line is open.
Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Hey, guys. My question was asked. I'll hand it back. Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is open.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, John, and to the rest of your team there. I appreciate you guys sticking around to answer all these questions. If I could ask what one about your dividend and your thinking there. You guys made a lot of moves and you've reviewed a lot of them on this call to adapt to a reduced commodity price early, but leaving the dividend intact stands out as an anomaly there. So I'm wondering if you can tell us a little bit about your thinking. And I know the board's thinking is really what comes to bear on this, but if you could give us some thoughts on your posture there.
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, this is Steve again. So you make very good points. We cut early, we took a lot of actions in 2015 that a lot of our peers didn't. And I think for that reason, we feel like we're very well positioned not to have to cut the dividend now. We've done all the things to strengthen the financial position, the liquidity position, our refinance risk on the debt portfolio. We've chosen to live 2015 and 2016 as close to cash flow neutral as possible. We've done that because we believe that, especially in North America, the opportunities for investment are going to be better in the future than they are now. There are some good ones now, but we believe they're going to be even better. So we've chosen to be cash flow neutral. So we've added $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, chosen to be cash flow neutral, we don't really need to reduce the dividend at this point in time. And we do discuss that with the board. We discuss it with them every quarter and I imagine we'll continue to discuss that with them every quarter. But we just don't think we need to be doing that now. We'll probably reconsider it at some point in time in the future when prices and costs are better aligned and we all kind of figure out whatever the new normal, if we ever get to normal, in our industry will be in the future, then we can look at what our dividend yield is and whether that's appropriate for the situation that we're in at that point in time. But, at this point in time, we just don't have any compelling reason to have to cut it. We do realize that the dividend yield is pretty high for the situation that we're in right now, but we're okay with that for now. And that's why we went ahead and declared the regular dividend with this last quarter.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: That's helpful, Steve. Thank you. And then if I could dig down into the details on one of your Permian well results. I think, John, earlier in your prepared comments, you talked about the June Tippett well, and looking at that, even though it was kind of a short lateral, on a lateral-adjusted basis, that looks like it's – at least one of the wells there, it looks like a real standout in the Midland Basin. And I'm wondering if you could tell me if you share that point of view and if you do, where the Midland kind of ranks? Because it seems like you're ranking the Delaware Basin, generally, in front of your opportunities in the Midland Basin.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support: Yes. This is Tim Sullivan. We did drill – this was at a Wildfire lease. We did drill five well pads in the June Tippett lease. Three of them actually came online in the fourth quarter and two of them online in early 2016. And what we have done here, these are mile laterals. We had acquired some additional core data out here and tweaked our landing zone, targeting a higher TOC and lower clay content area. And the 30-day IPs for the average of those five wells was 980 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and 75% of that is oil. And if you compare that to a well or a pad that we had drilled early in the air which was a mile-and-a-half pad, this mile pad is outperforming those. So we are pretty excited about that and we do have quite a bit of running room.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe with TPH. Your line is open
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Just a question on the North Sea. I appreciate that there are a number of discoveries coming online in 2017 and 2018 to arrest decline. That said, can you talk about the base decline of this asset and what these productions or what these discoveries, excuse me, will do to aggregate production growth in those years?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: At this point, we see the North Sea being able to hang in there pretty strongly with the capital levels we're at. We have not looked at what price decks we'd use, and a lot of that will hinge on how many platform rigs we have, do we add those back in, in 2017 and 2018. We mentioned they would not be there the back half of this year, so a lot of that's going to hinge on capital as we lay out those future years. But we've got good running room now and a lot of nice things coming on.
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Michael, this is Steve. I'd also just point you to the presentation we made, the webcast that we made back in November. It's got some information that I think you'd find helpful.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Understood. Thanks. I was just trying to see if there's been any change in thought process there. But maybe just my last question would be just a question on the goal of spending within cash flow and the comment you made on cash flow movements with each change – dollar per barrel change in the oil price. Of your 2016 operating cash flow, do you have a sense for how much of that is attributable to North American Onshore versus your International business at $35 oil? Thanks.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't have that number off the top my head. You're going to have more cash flow coming out of the International in terms of on a per barrel basis just because our cash margins are higher. But I'll let – we can follow-up with exactly that split. I'll have Gary follow up with a better idea on the ratio.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.
Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Thank you for taking my questions. Steve mentioned that cash flow neutrality remains the approach whether oil prices rise up or down. I was wondering if hedging might also be part of the method, particularly if oil prices rise somewhat, to protect the timing of any increased spending exposure.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jeff, at some point, obviously, if we were going to commit a lot of capital, we would start to look at using hedging. I think you're in a period today where we don't have a cost structure that's not synchronized with price environment. But it is something in the future. If we were to put a lot of capital back to work that we would consider as a tool to offset or mitigate some of the risk to ensure that we can deliver the return objectives that we're focused on.
Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Thanks, John. My follow-up is, can you review the very low Permian well cost guidance that you gave, again, with average lateral links that correlate to those costs? And also do those estimates include more intensive completions?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In terms of our Permian well cost, we see things coming down and even further this year. As a rule, we're looking at mile-and-a-half laterals. We have seen the intensity of the frac concentrations going up. So those are the types of parameters we're going to use or using in those estimates.
Operator: And I would now like to turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.
Gary T. Clark - Vice President-Investor Relations: That's going to wrap up the call, Kim. There's no more questions. We look forward to speaking to you all next quarter, and please give myself or Chris Cortez a call if you have any follow-up questions. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call, and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon, my name is Jennifer and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. And Mr. Gary Clark, you may begin your conference.
Gary T. Clark - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you and good afternoon. Welcome to Apache Corporation's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; and CFO, Steve Riney. Also joining us in the room is Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President of International and Offshore; and Tim Sullivan, Senior Vice President of Operations. In conjunction with this morning's press, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our quarterly earnings supplement, which summarizes Apache's regional operating activities and well highlights. The supplement also includes our revised full-year 2015 guidance, details of our capital expenditures in the quarter, as well as a chart that illustrates cash sources and uses and reconciles Apache's change in net debt during the third quarter of 2015. Our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations and our quarterly earnings supplement can all be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. Also, please note that in this morning's press we have consolidated our production and pricing information for the Midcontinent and Gulf Coast regions, which is were reported separately. I would now like to turn the call over to John.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Gary. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Before I dive into our results for the quarter I would like to take a step back to highlight the progress we have made so far this year. We have significantly streamlined and high graded our portfolio. The result is a focused North American onshore position with significant visibility and an international portfolio, which delivers tremendous free cash flow and very good exploration upside, as evidenced by our announcement last week regarding recent discoveries in the North Sea, along with our consistent exploration success in Egypt. We have strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity. We used the proceeds from asset sales to pay down debt and to increase our cash position. During this time, we also refreshed and extended our credit facility. Apache's balance sheet is now a leader amongst our peers, which we have accomplished without issuing new equity. Over the last third quarters, we reduced our drilling and completion program to a level that is appropriately aligned with the current commodity price environment. Notably, we generated a cash flow to CapEx surplus in the second quarter and would have maintained a surplus in the third quarter if commodity prices hadn't further eroded. This need for spending discipline is something that many in the industry are just beginning to realize and pursue. We have now achieved a nearly 30% reduction in our average well cost compared to a year ago. We have relentlessly pursued cost reductions both through supply chain efficiencies, as well as self-help through such things as improving wellbore and completion design. We made significant reductions in our run rate for both LOE and G&A costs, and we are taking steps to realize additional savings through the fourth quarter and into 2016 and beyond. We have delivered production growth both domestically and internationally, despite a dramatically reduced activity level. This result has been supported by our low underlying base decline, and today, we are again increasing our 2015 production guidance. And lastly, we continue to leverage our technical expertise and experience to seek out potentially high impact, new resource plays by consolidating acreage and expanding our footprint within our existing operational basins. We remain highly disciplined in this effort. And it is important to note that we are not paying the high prices for acreage that are common in the high profile resource plays. Now let me turn to our third quarter results. The third quarter was another good one for Apache as we delivered on our operational and financial guidance, made excellent progress on our cost reduction initiatives, and had tremendous success with the drill bit, most notably in the Permian Basin, Egypt and in the North Sea. As a result, we are increasing our 2015 production guidance range for both North American onshore and our international and offshore regions. During the third quarter, WTI oil prices deteriorated to an average of $46 per barrel, which was a 20% decrease from the second quarter average. However, the impact on our capital program for the quarter was relatively small as we had the foresight to pace our spending based on a $50 WTI plan price for 2015. As we indicated on our second quarter earnings call, our North American onshore production decreased sequentially in the third quarter, but the drop was less than anticipated. The decrease was primarily driven by facility downtime in the Permian, natural decline rates and the timing of well completions. We continue to expect North American onshore production volumes to increase for the fourth quarter, and we should exit the year with solid production momentum. Currently expect to finish the year at the high end of our upwardly-revised North American onshore production guidance range of 307,000 boe to 309,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which reflects normal fourth quarter weather-related downtime. Should we experience unusually severe or extended weather disruptions, production may potentially move to the middle or low end of our new guidance range. As I mentioned earlier, both Egypt and the North Sea have been performing very well this year. Production from our international and offshore regions averaged 180,000 boes per day during the third quarter. The key factors contributing to this strong performance were excellent production efficiency or uptime, strong sustained production from existing wells and significantly better-than-expected contributions from new wells completed during the quarter. As a result, we have increased our 2015 international and offshore guidance range, which Steve Riney will discuss along with other updated guidance items shortly. Our CapEx in the third quarter, before leasehold, capitalized interest and non-controlling interest, was $762 million. This is down 16% from the second quarter and 38% from the first quarter and puts us well within our full-year guidance for 2015. Across all of our regions, we are continuing to pursue and deliver substantial capital cost improvements. For example, in the third quarter, our North American onshore well costs were down approximately 30% from a year ago, which represents an improvement from the 25% decrease we cited last quarter. Now I'd like to turn to some of our key regional highlights for the quarter. During the quarter, we operated an average of 28 rigs companywide, 12 in North America, 10 in Egypt and six in the North Sea, which represents a decrease of six rigs from the second quarter. For the last two quarters, we have essentially been running our business at an activity level where cash flow was roughly equal to CapEx under a $50 WTI oil price deck. Given the decrease in oil price during the third quarter, we elected to defer the addition of two rigs in the Permian and one of our two planned rig additions in the Eagle Ford. As a result, we are decreasing the high end of our 2015 capital spending guidance range by $100 million to $3.8 billion. The deferral of these three rigs will not materially impact our 2015 production, but will result in a lower drilled-but-uncompleted well count at the end of 2015 than we previously expected. In the Permian Basin, our production was 170,000 boes per day, down 2,100 boes per day from the second quarter. This was driven by a combination of facilities downtime and the timing of well completions. Despite these factors, our Permian production remained strong. This underscores the importance of our relatively low base decline rate of 22%. Some notable activity during the third quarter came from new completions on our Condor lease at Pecos Bend in the Delaware Basin. We completed four wells that materially exceeded our type curve on a per lateral foot basis in their first 30 days. Returns in the Delaware remain very strong, as we have achieved average well cost reductions of approximately 40% since 2014. In the Midland Basin, we brought our first well pad online at Azalea in Western Glasscock County and are seeing encouraging early results. This area has the potential for multiple landing zones, including upper and middle Wolfcamp and lower Spraberry targets. We also brought online four good wells in our Powell-Miller area, three with an average 30-day IP of more than 800 boes per day, and another with a 24-hour test rate in excess of 1,600 boes per day. In the Central Basin Platform and Northwest Shelf, we are continuing to see excellent results from our horizontal Yeso play at Cedar Lake, which is delivering very attractive returns at these low oil prices. We have also dedicated resources to our water flood effort and other low-decline EOR opportunities. We have a significant low decline base in the Central Basin Platform, which helps underpin our lower underlying decline rate that I referenced earlier. While our overall Permian activity levels are down substantially from 2014, we remain committed to testing the resource potential of several new areas across our significant acreage position and to identifying and unlocking additional resource for the long term. Turning to the Eagle Ford. We brought eight wells online during the quarter in our Ferguson Crossing area with an average 30-day IP of 1,545 boes per day. We have made great progress in optimizing the completion design and increasing the productive capacity of these wells, while at the same time, continuing to drive down costs. We have one rig working in the Eagle Ford for the remainder of 2015. In the Woodford/SCOOP, we are in the early stages of delineating our approximately 200,000 acres gross and 50,000 net acres. During the third quarter, we brought online the Truman 28-6-6 #1H, which recorded a strong average 30-day IP rate of 1,949 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We have two rigs running in the Woodford/SCOOP for the remainder of 2015 to continue delineation and to advance our understanding of this attractive acreage position. In Canada, we put our seven-well Duvernay pad online in late October. Completion and connection of the pad came in under budget and the flow results we have seen to-date are very encouraging. The team is doing an excellent job with costs in Canada and we plan to drill another Duvernay pad during the upcoming winter season. On our Montney acreage in the Wapiti area, we have received substantial interest from third parties regarding a potential joint venture with Apache and we are advancing these discussions. Our objective for the JV is to fund early-stage drilling and infrastructure. This will enable us to jump-start the investment program and begin to generate cash flow without having to divert our capital dollars from other areas of the portfolio. Turning to our international operations; during the third quarter, Apache became the largest oil and gas producer in Egypt on a gross operated basis. We are very proud of this achievement and the fact that our gross production has returned to peak levels established back in 2011 and 2012. The key here is that while production is at peak levels, our percentage of oil and our margins are now considerably higher when normalized for commodity prices. It should be noted that these production levels have been achieved despite a 35% reduction in capital spending year-to-date compared to 2014. This highlights the operational success for our teams and our ability to do more even in a reduced capital environment. Our strategy in Egypt is to target primarily oil and liquids reservoirs and to keep our production profiles as stable as possible. Our late 2014 discoveries of the Ptah and Berenice fields have helped advance this goal in 2015. During the third quarter, gross production from these two fields peaked at over 26,000 barrels of oil per day. Our objective is to sustain production from Ptah and Berenice at a high rate for as long as possible through the drilling of additional development wells. In addition to Ptah and Berenice, we have seen new discoveries across multiple concessions this year, which will continue to support our production and free cash flow generation in Egypt. In the North Sea, we had a strong third quarter as our sequential production grew more than 4,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the second quarter. We set a new production efficiency record of 92% uptime in the third quarter as we experienced minimal platform maintenance downtime. We also benefited from better-than-expected performance from new wells drilled in both the Forties and Beryl fields. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, I should point out that we are likely to experience more weather-related downtime, some of which has already occurred in late October and early November. On October 30, we issued a press release, which announced three significant discoveries at our K, Corona and Seagull prospects, along with two high-rate development wells in the North Sea. While still early in the development phase, the ultimate reserve potential of the three discoveries combined could be greater than 70 million barrels of oil equivalent net to Apache. This represents a potential 50% increase over the 145 million barrels of total booked proved reserves for the North Sea at the end of 2014. For more information on these discoveries and a review of our extensive North Sea exploration and development inventory, please join us for our North Sea Region Update webcast on November 17 at 9 a.m. Central Time. Similar to my comments on Egypt, it's important to note that the outperformance in the North Sea has been accomplished despite an approximate 25% reduction in capital spend year-to-date compared to 2014. In closing, as we look to 2016 and beyond, our organization and our balance sheet are well prepared for the possibility of lower for longer oil and gas prices. We have in place the planning, capital allocation and operational structure and focus that will enhance shareholder value, despite the challenging commodity price environment. Our singular focus is to optimize the growth of our enterprise, while improving returns. We have made great progress so far; recognize that we have more to do. We are now working from a position of strength. We have a premium acreage position in North America and we have the people and the technology to grow it. We have best-in-class businesses running in the North Sea and in Egypt. These are prolific hydrocarbon basins with many years of exploration and development ahead of them. We have invested heavily in infrastructure in these regions over the last decade, and keeping this infrastructure full by its nature leads to very high rate of return projects. We have right-sized our activity level and we have driven efficiency improvements relentlessly on both capital and expense. We have a strong balance sheet and good long-term liquidity. And most importantly, all of these improvements are starting to show up with strong results for 2015 and good momentum as we look forward to 2016. We will remain focused on driving the expansion of our North American portfolio, as it is our primary growth engine for the future. However, our international businesses have a demonstrated track record of delivering very high rates of return, along with the ability to sustain production volumes through time and provide significant free cash flow back to the corporation. These are franchises that we will continue to invest in for the long term. I will now turn the call over to Steve Riney.
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, John, and good afternoon. As John indicated, Apache had a very good third quarter. We have made excellent progress on both operational and financial fronts. We also still have much more to do. Today, I will highlight Apache's financial progress, which will include our financial results for the quarter, the results so far from our relentless focus on costs, a review of our balance sheet strength and liquidity position, our outlook for the remainder of 2015, and an update on our strategic planning process along with some very preliminary thoughts on 2016. So let's begin with the third quarter financial results. As noted in our press release, Apache reported a GAAP loss of $5.7 billion or $14.95 per common share. Our results for the quarter include a number of items outside of our core earnings that are typically excluded by the investment community in published estimates. The most significant of those items is a ceiling test write-down of our oil and gas properties totaling $3.7 billion after tax. As in prior periods, the write-down in the third quarter resulted from the continued low commodity price environment. Under full cost accounting, our upstream assets are carried at historical costs. Each quarter, we compare this cost basis to discounted after-tax future net cash flows, which are calculated using trailing 12-month average oil and gas prices with those prices and period-end costs held flat into perpetuity. To the extent the net book value of the assets exceeds this amount the result is a ceiling test write down. Based on strip prices as of September 30, we anticipate a further ceiling test write-down in the fourth quarter. This expectation is detailed in our 10-Q. In addition to the ceiling test write-down, other unusual charges during third quarter included a $1.5 billion charge for an increase in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, primarily due to a price environment which is unlikely to allow the realization of those tax assets for the next several years. And $446 million of other items, consisting primarily of $148 million for the impairment of our investment in the Australian fertilizer plant, $146 million for mostly price-induced impairments for gathering transportation and processing facilities, and $95 million of trailing tax effects associated with our previously-discontinued operations. Our earnings for the quarter adjusted for these items totaled a loss of $21 million, or $0.05 per share. Offsetting the low-price environment were positive results on the operational side, including strong delivery of production volumes across all regions, continued improvement in costs as our extensive efforts to reduce G&A and operating costs are showing through to actual results, and great progress in capital efficiency, as we are getting more from every dollar invested. Let me now turn to costs. The low oil price environment and reduced activity across the industry are continuing to result in downward pressure on costs. As oil and gas prices began to soften late last year, Apache moved decisively to ensure a leading-edge position to capitalize on cost deflation in the oil service industry. Since that time, we have made continual progress reducing both capital and operating costs. Capital spending year-to-date continues to track in line with our expectations. We have invested $3.8 billion through the first nine months of the year. As we have stated in the past, our guidance on capital spending excludes capital attributable to our one-third partner then Egypt, capitalized interest, leasehold purchases and capital associated with divested LNG and associated operations. Excluding these items, we have spent $2.9 billion through the first nine months of 2015. This level of spending is tracking in line with our prior guidance. On the lease operating expense side, our third quarter LOE was $9.03 per boe, which is 18% lower than the third quarter of 2014. On a year-to-date basis, we are averaging $9.33 per boe, which is 12% lower than the same period last year. So we continue to make significant progress on bringing down operating costs. On our second quarter conference call, we reported a 25% decline in our run rate of gross G&A costs. At that time, we stated our goal was to enter 2016 with a gross G&A run rate of approximately $700 million, representing a decrease of over 30% from our run rate of more than $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. As we further refine our 2016 budget, we continue to find additional G&A reduction opportunities and are now tracking slightly ahead of our goal. We will discuss this in more detail when we announce our formal 2016 budget in February. Next, I would like to make a few comments regarding our balance sheet and liquidity position. Over the past year, we implemented a number of measures, which has significantly improved our overall financial strength. Today our balance sheet and liquidity are amongst the strongest in the industry and we have accomplished this without issuing additional equity. We have made tremendous progress in a very short period of time and I believe this will serve us well as we continue through a difficult and unpredictable industry environment. So far in 2015, we have paid down $2.5 billion of debt. Currently our net debt is less than two times annualized 2015 adjusted EBITDA. We have extended our nearest long-term debt maturity to 2018, with only $700 million maturing prior to 2021. We have restructured and refreshed our current credit facility at $3.5 billion, which now matures in June 2020. And we have retained $1.7 billion of cash liquidity. And to ensure that we sustain this strong position, we have reduced our activity to a level where we can attain cash neutrality in the current price environment. I would like to remind everyone that as previously discussed, the repatriation of proceeds from some of our foreign asset sales has triggered a U.S. income tax payable of approximately $560 million. Actual cash payment of this liability will occur in the fourth quarter of this year, thus some might consider our net debt of $7.1 billion at the end of the third quarter as closer to $7.7 billion. However, so far in fourth quarter, we have signed agreements for the sale of non-upstream assets, which will bring in approximately $500 million in cash proceeds. $391 million of this is for our interest in the Australian fertilizer plant, which we have already closed and proceeds have been received. The remainder is associated with various non-core assets with no associated reserves or production. We expect to close those transactions in the fourth quarter or early 2016. In total, the proceeds from non-core asset sales largely offset the impact of the previously-mentioned tax payment on our net debt the end of the third quarter. Apache's strong balance sheet and liquidity position provide both security for the near-term, as well as tremendous flexibility for the long-term. We can comfortably fund the highest-quality projects across the portfolio, as well as our exploration, strategic tests and new play programs. We can do this within our continued cash flow from operations, while retaining significant flexibility for any strategic opportunities, which may arise in the future. We anticipate a successful finish to 2015, as Apache continues to deliver strong operational results. Therefore today, we are increasing our production guidance and decreasing our capital guidance for 2015. We are increasing our full-year guidance for 2015 North American onshore production to a range of 307,000 boe to 309,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. On a pro forma basis, this represents more than 2% year-over-year growth, despite significantly-reduced capital spending. John highlighted the extensive drilling and operating success we are enjoying internationally as well. Accordingly, we are raising our full-year 2015 international and offshore production guidance to 172,000 boe to 174,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 6,000 boe from our previous guidance of 164,000 boe to 168,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. On a pro forma basis, this represents year-over-year growth of 10% to 12%, despite significantly reduced capital spending and demonstrates the quality of our international portfolio. With regard to our 2015 capital spending, we are lowering the top end of our guidance range to $3.8 billion from $3.9 billion. This reflects our decision not to pick up three rigs in the onshore U.S. during the back half of the year, which John spoke about in his prepared remarks. In the planning front, Apache has taken significant steps towards achieving our objectives of enhancing returns, while living within our mean on a cash flow basis. As we refine our plan for 2016 and beyond, we will continue to make further progress. Our plan includes a rigorous process for capital allocation to our highest-quality opportunities, while achieving an appropriate balance between short, medium and long-term capital investment horizons. This is particularly important considering the price environment we are in today and the outlook for the future. As we look specifically at 2016, we are actively evaluating multiple scenarios with respect to commodity pricing and capital allocation. We are not in a position to provide guidance ranges for 2016 as our review is still underway. I will share, though, that the plan will be based on a few key things, which we have established this year. Notably, we will plan a capital program, which we believe will keep us cash flow neutral for the year. We will not attempt to balance cash flow within each quarter, but instead to level-load activity for the year. We will fund the capital program from operating cash flows; we will not use asset sales. We have not yet finalized the capital allocation plan for 2016 and are not prepared to provide a view on production volumes. However, we are prioritizing capital to projects providing the best combination of highest rates of returns, greatest value for the future, and a bias toward near-term production and earnings. We will provide more specific guidance, including our production outlook in February, when we discuss the 2016 plan in more detail. Finally, I would like to address one of our accounting methodologies, which we are examining for a possible change. In order to more closely align our financial reporting and to create more comparability with our large cap E&P peers, we are evaluating a conversion from full-cost accounting to the successful efforts accounting method. The primary reasons we are contemplating the change is because successful efforts is more commonly used by our comparable peers, creates less long-term price-related volatility on the balance sheet, and more accurately reflects the matching of expenses within the period in which they are incurred, especially as it relates to exploration expense. We'll have more to say about this in coming quarters. In closing, as we plan for the future, we are not idly waiting for commodity prices to recover. We have already taken calculated steps consistent with today's environment. As a result, we are well positioned to continue to profitably grow Apache, through an actively managed investment program in a potentially lower-for-longer commodity cycle. I look forward to a successful conclusion to 2015 and would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions and answers.
Operator: Our first question comes from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company.
Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to follow-up on the commentary just now about matching cash flow with CapEx, would that include the dividend or would the dividend be upside of that?
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. For 2016, our goal would be to match that including the dividend. So it would be cash flow neutral.
Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International: Including the dividend. Okay, great. And then I know you're working through this still, but could you provide any color on what you think maintenance CapEx might be to hold exit rate 2015 production flat through 2016?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Pearce, this is John. What I would say is the best thing to do is look at 2015 right now. I mean, we've guided to $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion of CapEx spend. As you will recall in February, we guided to relatively flat North American production and slight growth internationally. When you look at the CapEx levels, we had $1 billion outspend in the first quarter alone for this year. When you look at the capital numbers, clearly now, with the updated ranges today, at 307,000 boe to 309,000 boe on North America and 172,000 boe to 174,000 boe on international, we're showing 2% plus growth in North America and 10% to 12% growth on the international side on that type of capital program. I think the best thing we can do given this price environment; the commodity price is going be a big driver. As Steve mentioned, we're going to live within cash flow. And so as we start to pour that plan, that's a big key. And I'd say, looking into 2016 with the reductions we've had on the cost structure side, specifically on the costs we have in the house at this point at 30% down, capital's going to continue to go further. I can also tell you that a lot of that CapEx this year was spent early in the year when we had higher costs. And we see things even now that are going to point to lower costs going forward. So, the best thing to do is look at what we've done this year and kind of translate off of that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. Maybe just a follow-up on that, the 2016 budget parameters. I mean you say that living within cash flow excludes asset sales and includes the dividends. So, do asset sales then just create a buffer on your balance sheet? How do you contemplate the redeployment of those proceeds such as the $500 million announced in the quarter? I mean it's been a relatively sizable program and just curious how you think about that capital coming back into the business.
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I'll let John comment on this as well. But I think at this point in time, the right answer to that question is the fact that we're not contemplating any material asset sales in 2016. And therefore, we're not planning to spend the proceeds on any of those. And therefore, cash flow neutrality needs to be on an operating basis. Now, that's – I'd just caution all of that with the fact that we're not going to get dogmatic about being cash flow neutral. And we reserve the right to not be cash flow neutral. But it's going to be – it's a prudent assumption going into the year at this point in time. And then 2016, I have no doubt, will be just as exciting as 2015 has been. And we'll, no doubt, adjust plans as we go through the year. But I think the prudent thing to do at this point in time is to go into the year planning on being cash flow neutral.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it, I would agree. Maybe my second, if I could, following up on the comments on the JV process, the positive progress there and then the plans to run three rigs in Canada next year versus zero today. Can you discuss the cost environment in Canada and how you kind of see those returns stacking up against the rest of your portfolio? I presume that the JV details could also augment those returns for you. If you could.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In general, Evan, we want to remain cash flow neutral in Canada. I mean what I don't want to do is take cash flow from our Lower 48 properties and spend that in Canada. So that's the main reason why we are looking at and are making progress on a JV in the Montney. And the way that would be structured is we would be using other capital to get that program kicked off. In terms of how the Montney and the Duvernay compete in terms of – they compete very nicely with the portfolio. And I'm going ask Tim Sullivan to dig in a little bit on the cost structure we're seeing on the Duvernay at this point.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support: Yes. As John mentioned, we just put on the first Duvernay pad that we drilled. This was a seven well pad. It was a spacing test. Half of the section was designed to test eight wells per section; the other half to test six wells per section. We're going through a third party facility. So, we're a little bit curtailed, we only have four of the wells online. But those four wells are doing just under 13 million boe (34:50) a day and 3,350 barrels of condensate per day. Again those are curtailed with the flowing tubing pressure of over 3,300 pounds. Next week we hope to have that facility up and running and we'll be able to bring the other three wells online. And we should have everything flowing at capacity on December 1. Now to the cost structure question, last year we spent about $18.1 million drilling one-off wells out there. We went to pad operations. This year where we had two walking rigs and we batch drilled each section of the well. We were able to reduce our well cost by 36%, 8% of that savings was due to foreign exchange, but the rest of it was primarily due to cost savings and operational efficiencies. And most of those operational efficiencies were made up on the completion side. In those seven laterals we did 124 different frac stages and we pumped that in just six days. We averaged 7.9 fracs per day, with only 34 minutes between stages. And we got down to as low as 6 minutes between two of the stages. So we were pumping 82% of the time when we had the equipment on location. And really the Canadian team there, we're really leveraging the learnings that we had from the Horn River drilling that we've done in the past. And we see future costs there as we get our water facility in place even going down further and we think we can get these costs down to $8.5 million to $9 million per well.
Operator: Your next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, good afternoon, everybody. John, I appreciate the disclosure I guess on the pursuit of a joint venture. If I could just have a quick follow-up. If we look at your position up there, it seems that, if I'm not mistaken, the bulk of your locations is in the area where you have the lowest working interest. And the highest working interest I guess you've got about half the number of locations, so I'm thinking Duvernay being the one with the small working interest. So when you think about structuring a joint venture and I guess getting someone to fund you or carry you, is that the kind of structure we should think about? In which case, what kind of working interest would you anticipate getting to and how would you think about that? I've got a follow-up, please.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Doug, I got to be a little bit careful. We're talking about the Montney and it's an area we have 100%. So we do not have partners. We're not at this point looking at the Duvernay. The area you're talking about, the current wells we've got about 37.5%. We're in there with Chevron and, of course, their joint venture partner. So, we're really talking about an area in the Montney where we have 100%. And that is the area we're looking at and I don't want to get into too much color because we're in the heat of battle of negotiations. But it would be structured where we would obviously be able to keep the majority and would get significant carry upfront, and which would unease our infrastructure and costs going, over the next couple years.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I appreciate that. I don't know if I missed that earlier. That would make perfect sense given your working interest there. Thank you for that. My follow-up is really about – I realize you don't want to give production guidance, but if you look at the spend level in the third quarter – and obviously there's a lot of moving parts on production declines and so on. But if you continue to spend at the third-quarter level, based on what we saw in Q3, what would you say your underlying decline rate would look like?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean in terms of our decline rate, if I take North America, we're still running about a 25% overall decline, our Permian's about 22%. I do anticipate those numbers coming down as we start to look at the pace because we just haven't drilled as many new wells this year as we have historically. So I think those numbers will be dropping slightly, but it's early. We're still working through those planned numbers. The one thing I would say about the back half of the year, as we alluded to on the call, with the drop in prices we held off picking up three rigs, two in the Permian and one in the Eagle Ford. And it's going to have very minimal impact; we're still in a position to raise guidance on our North American position. So, we feel good about our properties, we feel good about how we're executing and we're really starting to see efficiencies drive into the numbers.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great stuff. I will jump back in queue. Thanks, John.
Operator: And your next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good afternoon.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Brian.
Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: How are you thinking about the role of the international assets here, particularly in light of some of the positives you reported on in Egypt and the North Sea? Are there any changes in, A, how these areas are competing for capital relative to the rest of the portfolio, and B, the strategic thoughts on retaining versus divesting?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, Brian, I think at this point, when we look into the future, our primary growth is going to come from North America. I think you have to recognize the benefit of the portfolio. And we came out with that early in the year with the drop in prices, and the international both are less sensitive to the drop in oil price and you've seen that come through in cash flow from both those operations. Secondly, if you take Egypt and take Ptah and Berenice, tell me how many places in the world you can have a discovery and within seven, eight months you're producing from two handfuls of wells to 26,000 barrels of oil a day? So we've got quick tie-in, quick infrastructure to those things, so very high rates of return. In the North Sea, there's a couple of things there. Number one, we've invested in the infrastructure. We spent $1.3 billion over the last decade at Forties and that infrastructure is in really good shape. That's why we can operate at 92%. In our Beryl area we spent over $300 million on the infrastructure there. So, I don't want to steal the thunder from our November 17 update on the North Sea, but with those three discoveries, one of them is a little longer cycle time, Seagull, but the other two, I think you'll be surprised at how quickly we can bring those projects on through tie-backs to the infrastructure that's already in place. So, we look at it as a portfolio. Our long-term growth is going to come from North America clearly, but in this price environment right now I've got a lot of optionality in the international and a lot of very high rate of return projects that bring immediate volumes that compete extremely well that we can tie in and complement. I think we've also proven through the exploration success that both of the international assets, those franchises have a lot of running room. And we'll get into more color on the North Sea here in just less than two weeks.
Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thanks. And my follow-up shifts to the Permian Basin. I believe you said in the ops update here there are no rigs currently in the Barnhart area, which had been a source of your development. As you've shifted more towards the other parts of the Permian, can you talk about how we should look at execution and growth relative to when you were a bit more Barnhart-focused, and what you see as differentiating or we should expect as differentiating Apache's Permian position relative to others who are in the region?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean I think the first and foremost thing, Brian, is we've got a very strong position across all the basins and that gives us lots of flexibility and optionality. Right now in the Permian we're really not in development mode, we are still doing a lot of strategic tests. We're in the process right now of drilling our three Spraberry shale wells that we're very excited about. So I think as we moved into the deeper parts of the basin, we've seen better results in the Midland Basin and I think the Delaware, we've got strong results in the area we've been active there, Pecos Bend and our Waha. So I think what you'll see is we know how to execute, we've been in position where we've done a lot of pad drilling, and so we know what that means and our asset quality is just as good as anybody's. We just happen to be spread out across the multiple basins. So as we look at 2016, we won't be, and it depends on the price environment we're in as to how much development dollars we shift into Permian, but the big thing we're going be focused on right now is trying to mirror our cost structure to that price environment. And we're making headway there. And I think the one thing that you can look to is just our results on some of the plays. And I think we stand up well with anybody.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bob Morris with Citi.
Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. John, in the Permian and pulling back two rigs you originally intended to add, does that mean you're going to ramp up now to only 16 rigs by year-end? And where are you right now?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right now, we're at 14 rigs, Bob. I think we really just deferred. And all that's really done for us is we will end the year with fewer drilled-but-uncompleted wells. But we felt like that's the prudent thing to do right now based on where oil prices are and trying to feather our programs going into 2016, living within cash flow.
Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And so the two rigs you won't add, where had you intended to add those rigs in the Permian?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: They were going to be predominantly Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform.
Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then the drilled-but-uncompleted inventory you ran, where is that? And is that steady-state or is that an inventory that you can draw down further in 2016?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean first and foremost, we had guided to on the last quarter a range in the 80 to 100 range of drilled-but-uncompleted horizontals in North America. We now see that number ending the year around 60 plus. And it's not that during the quarter we consumed a lot of drill – picked up our completion pace. We just elected to wait. And the main reason is we've got visibility on costs coming down further. We've got a few drilling rigs that some term is rolling off in the next 30 days. And we're going to see those rig rates drop 37%, 38%. So we made a decision over this last quarter not to, in fact, we lowered the top end of our capital guidance range by $100 million. We decided not to spend that $100 million now, and we can wait and spend those in the future.
Operator: And your next question comes from John Herrlin with Société Generale.
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC: Yes. Hi. Not trying to preempt the North Sea discussion that you will have in two weeks, but is it fair to say that you may dedicate a little bit more CapEx in 2016 to the North Sea?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: John, I wouldn't see, mix is changing too much. I mean, we've had, if you look at our capital this year, North Sea actually is down 25% over last year. So I don't see a major shift. You're not going to see us shift a ton of money by any means. But I think you're going to see we've got a lot more running room. And we've got some very material things that could come on that can be very impactful.
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, John. Regarding the switch to successful efforts, any kind of a ballpark sense about what kind of a balance sheet hit it would be?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll let Steve jump in on that one.
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I was hoping you'd answer that, John. No, I think it's too early to say. We've got in the 10-Q what we believe the fourth quarter hit to the balance sheet will be because of staying on full cost accounting and further softness in the commodity prices. But it's too early to say at this point in time what will happen if and when we switch to successful efforts to the balance sheet.
Operator: And your next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks for taking the question. Just coming back to the Midland. Obviously the industry has had success delineating various different zones in the Delaware. I mean you've got some very good wells out at the Pecos Bend. You've got a lot of wells or you've got some acreage, Wildfire, Azalea, Powell-Miller, over on the Midland. I'm just wondering if you are able to give us, having had more time working with the acreage, some kind of, as others do, inventory that works at say $50 in terms of well locations and then $60, $70. So some un-risked sense of the inventories in those two particular areas.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: What I would say, Ed, is we have not done a – I mean, obviously we're working those areas. We continue to test lots of zones. You look in the Midland Basin, we've got multiple zones in there we're testing. As I mentioned, we're about to drill or in the process of drilling Spraberry shale wells. You look at our Pecos Bend area; we've gone in now and added a second landing zone within the 3rd Bone Springs. So, we continue to make progress. We continue to test zones and really scope opportunities and work on the cost structure so that when we get to a position where we feel like it makes sense to put more rigs and more capital to work, we're ready to do that. In terms of counts, we have not come out with a bunch of updated numbers. Really, the best look would be going back to what we did a year ago where we did a very deep look at North America on November 20, 2014. And obviously, we've got areas where things have, you know, we've drilled some things and things have expanded, but we haven't really come out with any major announcements or counts at this point.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I guess the issue was the oil price was a lot higher and the cost structure is very different today, so I was just trying to get an update on that. But maybe switching to break-evens, I mean the Seagull discovery, I mean have you – I don't want to – again steal thunder from what's coming in a few weeks, but what sort of oil price do you think it would take to get that hooked back into infrastructure?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Not going to really get into that right now, but I can tell you the nice thing about the North Sea is the deliverabilities and the high rates those rocks bring. They're very forgiving; tremendous rock. We announced in the press release a very substantial test rate on a very, very low drawdown. So the deliverability is going be fantastic there, but I'm not in a position today to disclose F&D. That will be a longer – a little longer-range project. It's four miles kind of south of our Forties area, but we will have some color on November 17.
Operator: And your next question comes from John Freeman with Raymond James.
John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So nice well results in the Delaware Basin, but what really jumped out at me in particular was you completed 22 wells in the area versus 12 last quarter, despite still using just the one frac crew. And so I'm trying to get an idea of – you completing nearly twice as many wells with the same number of frac crews. Is that all huge efficiency gains or is there some other moving parts that doesn't make the quarters comparable?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I think, number one, is just the pace at which we had them, but number two, we are making tremendous headway on efficiencies everywhere. We also are getting wells drilled significantly faster as well as getting more wells fracked. Tim gave you some color on the Duvernay pad, how quickly those went off. We're seeing tremendous success operationally everywhere, and that's just a function of it doesn't take as much equipment to go as far as it did a year ago.
John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. And then on Egypt you disclosed that you've initiated this large seismic reprocessing project that you hope to have done by the end of the year. I guess I'm just curious sort of what kind of took place in the field that kind of drove the decision to have it; what you hope to kind of get out of that shoot or reprocessing? Excuse me.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support: Reprocessing?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In Egypt.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support: Yeah.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In Egypt.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support: And where is it, or?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: He asked the scope and what we thought we could get from it with the large reprocessing in Egypt.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support: Well, as you're well aware, the whole basis of our success in Egypt is that 3D seismic, and with continued technological advances, improved processing and basically combining previous shoots, adding new data, we just get a more clear picture of the same areas we've been working for years. So, all this is going to do is help us identify previously unseen prospects and continue to deliver inventory in future years.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And two perfect examples are Ptah and Berenice. I mean they're right there at our Khalda Offset area, right near our existing stuff. So, it's just a function of taking the technology up that can quantify and get really solid ties and – to the – some of the plays out there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. John, last quarter you and Steve spent some time laying out your new planning process where you guys were running scenarios at three different price points for WTI, or for oil I should say. I was wondering if you could give us an update if you've moved where those prices are in your scenarios. And perhaps more broadly, as you've been working that process over the last several months, if you're finding any areas that are surprising to you either in terms of their rigidity or new areas of flexibility you've discovered.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Charles, we did move those. I mean we started the year with a – kind of a $50, $65 and $80, and we planned on $50 at the start, and then in April, May timeframe when things ran up into the mid-$60s we were using those decks. Clearly, we've moved those down. In the last call we talked kind of $45, $55, $65. We're not too far off of those cases as we think about things today. The one thing I would say is the resiliency of the projects moves a little bit. The bigger tie is what are you doing with gas prices and how does that link in with some of these plays that we've got that have a little higher GOR and gas rates? But in general, we're seeing projects and wells in every play that works very well and it's really a function of the cash flow that comes off of those scenarios and the cost structure assumptions are the biggest variables we're trying to get pinned down right now.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it, that's helpful. And that's also kind of a good lead in to my next question where I wanted to ask about the Eagle Ford, where you guys have turned in really some really good-looking rates there. But one of the things that I attuned to there is that you have 80% liquids and a lot of times that can include NGLs, which are kind of actually the lowest molecule on the totem pole right now. So can you – and I know the oil, gas, and maybe the NGL mix varies a bit as you go up and down dip in this play, but these most recent wells you've had in your Area A – the Eagle Ford, the Lambert and (54:58) where do those fall on the percentage of black oil?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll have Tim give you that exact number. I still think we're in the 55% range roughly in terms of black oil. The Area A wells, those are still within our Ferguson Crossing area. So if you go back to our November 20 update a year ago and you look at that type curve Area A, Charles, they're going to layer right in on those – on that type curve, which I think we gave those numbers specifically there. I'm looking over here if we've got the percentages from that type curve, but I know we disclosed those.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support: Yes, we can get back with you on those, Charles. We've got those numbers for that area.
Operator: Your next question is from Leo Mariani with RBC.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, guys. Just a question around the acreage acquisitions that you all were talking about. Looks like you did a healthy portion. You guys commented that you're sort of paying prices which were a lot less than some of these hot high-profile deals we've seen recently. Can you guys just let us know where are you concentrating the acreage acquisitions? Is it sort of Delaware, Midland, or Midcon? Can you just help us with where you're looking to buy?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Number one, we're within our core areas. Number two, we are looking at some things that would be significantly lower than what I'd call the retail prices that are being paid. And it's where we're applying technology and science and we think we've got some things that could be material. It is new ventures acreage, so there's always risk with that and that's why we wouldn't want to talk about it now. But we're talking significant multiples lower in terms of what that acreage might be viewed as and what it potentially could be worth. And I think that's the zip-code that we feel like makes the most sense in this price environment because we can pick it up and we can work the science and you can have something that could be material.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. I guess jumping over to Egypt; you obviously had good performance in terms of your increases in gross production in the third quarter. I noticed that the net production, though, went down a fair bit in 3Q versus 2Q, despite lower commodity prices. What's driving that and how should we think about that going forward?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's the tax barrels. I'm going let Steve Riney give you the exact color on that.
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, Leo. As you said, rightfully, so gross production in the third quarter was about 3.5% above second quarter. And actually net entitlement to the venture owners, us and Sinopec, was also up about a little over 3%, about 3.5%. The issue is around tax barrels and tax barrels on a three-thirds basis for the PSC owners, tax barrels were down 20,000 barrels a day between oil and gas. And the reason for that, there's no economic effect of that. It's the in-quarter reimbursement of taxes associated with income taxable in Egypt. And the bottom line issue is in the third quarter, prices had declined to a point where there was practically no taxable income. As a matter of fact, in one month I think we had a negative tax barrel effect. And so therefore both the tax, income tax expense and the barrels associated with reimbursing that income tax expense were much lower.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.
Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors: A lot of mine have been answered, but I guess just curious on the longer-range outlook. You guys have talked about providing that in the past. Should we expect to hear about that in February as well, or what sort of I guess timeframe in your current thinking; when we will hear about that?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Michael, we obviously will give you a full-year 2016 update in February, and we'll see how things look at that point. So, clearly we're working multi-year plans. But obviously with the volatility and the uncertainty around the prices right now, we're going to continue working that.
Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors: Okay. And then just looking at the mix of production in North America; got a bit more NGL relative to our expectations in gas. Is there anything driving that from an infrastructure standpoint or is that more the focus of the capital program from a reservoir perspective?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I mean actually I think when you look at our numbers, and you look at 2014 and 2015, and our percent oil in 2014 averaged about 52.7% for the year, we'll be 52.5%. We're right in line. In fact if you add our NGLs in 2014 and 2015, 65%. So you step back, big picture there's virtually no change in our mix. And we have the luxury of being more liquids rich and heavy than a lot of others. I will say you see some small swings when we've ramped our programs down to some of the GORs and some of the programs. For example, last quarter we brought on some gas here, Area A, Eagle Ford wells. If you look at our North Sea production, we've shifted more to the Beryl area where we've got a little higher GOR than we do at Forties, but I should say we get a very premium gas price up there, over $7. When you look at the Permian right now, we've had as a percentage more in the Delaware. Those wells had the luxury of having very flat GORs, but they come on at higher levels. So it's just a function of the portfolio, but in general, if you step back and take a big picture look, it's virtually where it's been historically.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Campbell with Tuohy Brothers.
Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: The first question I wanted to ask is if we could talk about the Canyon Lime upper interval. You highlighted shallower declines. I was wondering, are you doing anything to influence the decline? And while we're at it, how pervasive do you think the upper interval is throughout your acreage?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, I'm going to – I'll let Tim Sullivan comment on the Quanah well on the Canyon Lime.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support: The Quanah well is a new landing zone. It's the only well that we've got in that landing zone. It's been producing about 2.5 months. The IP 30 on that was about 1,662 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In that 2.5 months it's cumed already 91,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and is still doing just under a 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. So, it is a standalone well, but it's just a function of getting the spacing right. We have not been curtailing production or anything. It's just a shallower decline and we're excited about that zone.
Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay, thank you. And I wanted to just ask another broader question. Not too long ago there was talk about revived industry interest in vertical Permian drilling based on returns. I was just wondering have you increased your vertical drilling any on that basis?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jeff, we haven't. But I think, one thing I'll say we've got the luxury of having about 60 water floods and seven CO2 floods in the Permian. And we have a ton of vertical locations; infill locations that do make economic sense. And right now we do not have any vertical rigs running. That's an option that we could have for next year. But we have not made any decision at this point yet.
Operator: Our final question for today comes from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, glad I got in. John, can you – if I think about the Permian and just obviously the slowdown in the rig count and look at production quarter-over-quarter down-ticking a little bit, gas up, oil down, when should we anticipate that inflection point as far as when we see stabilization and then move higher?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean I think that really comes down to when we feel like it's time to go back to work with more rigs. And so I mean that's just a function of how much capital we want to spend and we made a decision not to add two more rigs here within the last quarter. We'll go and do 16 and see, but I mean that's all going to hinge off of cash flow and investable projects. I mean we've got a ton of inventory that they're chomping at the bit to drill, but it's just a function of trying to go back to our guiding principles of living within cash flow, focusing on our returns, focusing on the cost structure and growing value for our shareholders.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right, everything else has been asked. Thanks, appreciate it.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Gary T. Clark - Vice President-Investor Relations: Jennifer, thanks. We're going to wrap it up there. We're well past the top of the hour. We had a long queue today, so if we didn't get to your call please give the IR team a call. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking with you in February. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Suzy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome, everyone, to the Apache Corporation 2015 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Clark, you may begin your conference.
Gary T. Clark - Vice President-Investor Relations: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; and CFO, Steve Riney. Also joining us in the room is Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President of International and Offshore; as well as Tim Sullivan, Senior Vice President of Operations. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our quarterly earnings supplement, which summarizes our operational activities and well highlights across various Apache operating regions. The supplement also includes information on our revised full-year guidance, capital expenditures for the quarter, as well as a chart that illustrates cash sources and uses and reconciles Apache's change in net debt during the second quarter of 2015. Our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables, and non-GAAP reconciliations, and our quarterly earnings supplement can all be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com. I'd like to remind, everyone, that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. And I would now like to turn the call over to John.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Gary. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm very pleased with our second quarter results and the tremendous amount of progress we have made refocusing our asset base, strengthening our balance sheet, and restructuring our operational organization. Importantly, we are continuing to deliver on our cost initiatives, and we are exceeding our previously established production goals. During the quarter, we closed on the sales of our LNG business and remaining oil and gas assets in Australia, which served to more strategically align our portfolio with our core competencies. In doing so, we greatly enhanced our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. Additionally, we reduced our drilling and completion activities and overall spending to a level that is more in line with the current commodity price environment. We also realigned our management and regional operating structure to drive greater efficiencies, and we implemented meaningful new initiatives to reduce overall G&A costs. Finally, we delivered strong production both domestically and internationally, which is prompting us to raise our 2015 production guidance. Looking ahead, we anticipate having strong production momentum as we exit 2015 and believe that we will have the flexibility to live within 2016 cash flow, while maintaining relatively stable year-over-year production levels. Now I'd like to review our operational results in greater detail. During the second quarter, onshore North American production averaged 317,000 BOEs per day and once again came in ahead of our expectations. This was driven by strong operational performance across the entire portfolio and in particular from new well contributions in the Permian and the Eagle Ford. Our performance internationally was also impressive. Excluding Australia, pro forma production from international and Gulf of Mexico was 172,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Egypt was a significant driver during the quarter as delineation of the Ptah and Berenice oil fields continued to drive gross production sequentially higher. In the North Sea, our production declined modestly from the first quarter as a result of two seasonal platform maintenance turnarounds, but was still above internal expectations due to production efficiencies. We have also had recent drilling success in the North Sea, which I will discuss in a few minutes. Our performance on the capital side, during the quarter, was in line with our expectations. Expenditures on continuing operations before leasehold acquisitions, capitalized interest, and non-controlling interest were $857 million, which was down 28% from the first quarter. In addition to realizing service cost reductions, Apache is delivering solid drilling and completion efficiency gains, which is critical in this low oil price environment. At the beginning of the year, we took aggressive steps to address our cost structure and established a plan to reduce drilling and completion costs by at least (5:30) levels. Year-to-date we have already achieved the 15% reduction and are on a run rate for an approximate 25% reduction for the remainder of the year. We now believe that there are potentially even more cost savings over and above the 25% if oil prices remain at current levels. Our lease operating expenditures per BOE were down 13% year-over-year in the second quarter, and our G&A run rate is following quickly as a result of the overhead initiatives that we are pursuing on multiple fronts. Steve Riney will provide some more details in a few minutes on those items, as well as some forward-looking guidance. As noted in our press release this morning, we raised our full-year 2015 onshore North American production guidance to between 305,000 BOE to 308,000 BOEs per day, the midpoint of which is up approximately 5,000 BOEs per day from our prior implied guidance. We are also effectively raising our international guidance, as we now see production in Egypt and the North Sea up 5% to 8% this year on a pro forma basis, which is a notable increase from our previous guidance of up slightly. Looking at our onshore North American production profile for the remainder of the year, we expect third quarter production will be down sequentially from the second quarter. This is due primarily to monthly well completion timing, planned downtime associated with offset fracing operations, and planned facility and plant maintenance in the Permian. In the fourth quarter, however, we expect a strong production rebound and project that December will be our highest production month in the fourth quarter, absent any adverse weather events. Overall, we feel very good about our performance to date and our projected production momentum as we enter 2016. It is important to note that we are in the process of developing our initial 2016 plan, as well as our five-year plan. This will put us in a better position to provide more thoughts around next year's production and capital outlook on our third quarter call. I'd like to now discuss some of our key operational areas and activity plans for the remainder of the year. During the second quarter, we operated an average of 34 rigs company-wide with 15 rigs in North America, 12 rigs in Egypt, and 7 rigs in the North Sea. In North America, we completed 63 gross operated wells during the quarter, which was a 51% decrease from the first quarter. Despite the significant drop in completion activity, our onshore North American production grew by 9300 barrels of oil equivalent per day sequentially. The majority of this increase was driven by the Permian Basin where we delivered strong new well results and experienced a bounce back from the tough first quarter weather conditions and shut-ins. We consider our Permian Basin to be advantaged in this current environment due to a relatively low base decline rate of approximately 22%. This is aided by our Central Basin Platform and North West Shelf assets, which represent approximately half of our gross production from the Permian and have a decline rate of roughly 14%. We have several production enhancement initiatives under way, including various water flood activities, and ESP installations that serve to protect our base decline rate at a fairly low capital cost. In the Delaware Basin, we saw a strong oil performance in the Pecos Bend area and generated positive results from our delineation and target testing. Drilling at our 7-well Osprey pad confirmed good performance from 660 foot down-spaced wells and also helped to confirm an additional landing zone in the third Bone Spring formation, which appears to be performing as well as our primary target in the third Bone Spring. In the Waha area, we placed our first two wells online during the last week of June. Initial results look encouraging, and we will update you on this area next quarter. At our North American update on November 20 of last year, we shared an average well cost for the Delaware Basin of $8 million. Today, we are drilling those wells in the mid to upper $5 million range, and our target is to get down closer to $5 million, which would represent an approximate 35% reduction from November 20. In the Midland Basin, we ran three rigs during the second quarter, with one in our Wildfire area, one in Powell-Miller, and one at Azalea. Our first four wells at Wildfire in Midland County showed strong 30-day average IP rates of 1,090 BOEs per day in the middle Wolfcamp. We plan to complete an additional eight wells in this area during the second half of the year, three of which will be drilled to the lower Spraberry. During the second half of the year, we will be completing 11 wells in the Powell-Miller and Azalea areas, which we anticipate will contribute solid results. Lastly, at Barnhart, we brought on four wells during the quarter, which exhibited some of the strongest results we have seen to-date across the field. In the Central Basin Platform and North West Shelf, we see numerous opportunities across our acreage position to continue drilling wells with high rates of return. We are currently focusing on areas such as the Cedar Lake Yeso play and the Seth Campbell Clearfork play, which are highlighted in our quarterly supplement. These plays offer relatively inexpensive drilling and completion cost, thus yielding very attractive rates of return in today's low commodity price environment. Turning to the Eagle Ford. During the second quarter, we made important progress in optimizing our completion techniques and significantly improving flow rates on the four new wells we brought online. Our current focus in the Eagle Ford has primarily been in Area A at Ferguson Crossing in Brazos County. During the second quarter, we brought online four key wells, two on our Walker pad and two on our Rae pad. The 30-day average IP of the two Walker wells was 1,935 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which significantly exceeds Apache's Area A type curve and represents our highest flow rates in the Eagle Ford play to-date. Based on these results, we plan to add a rig back into the Eagle Ford at Ferguson Crossing, during the second half of 2015, which will help us continue optimization and delineation of this highly prospective area. In the Midcontinent, which was formerly our Central region, production was down 7% sequentially from the first quarter, as a result of natural declines and reduced activity. During the second quarter, we completed only six wells compared to 24 wells during the first quarter. Apache's primary focus in the Midcontinent is delineating our Woodford/SCOOP acreage and continued testing of the Canyon Lime play. In the Woodford, we have one rig drilling and delineating our 50,000 plus net acres, primarily in Grady County, and we plan to add another rig in the fourth quarter of 2015. We recently brought online our first Woodford well of 2015, with very good initial results. The Truman 28-6-6 #1H, a 16-stage 4,400 foot lateral, tested at a peak rate of 392 barrels of oil and 6.9 million cubic feet of gas per day on a 20/64-inch choke. We plan to complete at least three more Woodford wells this year, including a two-well pad that is waiting on completion and another well which is currently drilling. In Canada, we had very little drilling and completion activity during the quarter. However, our production declined less than expected due to minimal weather-related downtime. The next significant activity scheduled is the completion of our seven-well Duvernay pad in the fourth quarter of this year. Turning to our international operations. In Egypt, Apache's continued exploration and development success is driving better-than-expected production volumes year-to-date. As noted in our press release, we experienced positive results during the quarter at our Ptah and Berenice oil fields in the Faghur Basin. We now have nine wells online at these new fields producing a combined gross rate of more than 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. During the second quarter, the Ptah-5X exploration well appraised the northeast flank of the Ptah field and is flowing at a restricted rate of 3,000 barrels of oil per day. We also drilled and completed our first development well, which flowed at a 30-day average IP rate of more than 3,000 barrels of oil per day. Apache has five wells drilled in the Ptah field, all of which are currently producing. In the Berenice field, Apache drilled an additional development well during the quarter that logged 93 feet of pay and is now online. This marks the fifth well drilled to-date in the Berenice field, four of which are currently producing. Our current 2P reserve estimate for the Ptah and Berenice fields is approximately 50 million barrels, which we believe will require a total of 20 wells to 25 wells to fully develop. During the quarter, Apache achieved an exploration success rate in Egypt of 78%, which is significantly above the company's historical average. In the North Sea, two seasonal platform maintenance turnarounds reduced output by approximately 3,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, but production still exceeded our internal plan. We anticipate a strong second half of the year, which has minimal scheduled maintenance downtime. As a result, we now project that pro forma North Sea production will be flat year-over-year, compared to our previous expectation of down slightly. In the Beryl field area, we made a significant exploration discovery with the 9/19 B/K well, which we refer to as the K prospect. The well encountered 235 feet of net pay in two Jurassic-age sandstone reservoirs. Apache's pre-drill mean unrisked reserve estimate for the K prospect was approximately 7 million barrels of oil equivalent and, given our initial test results, we believe recoverable reserves are likely to significantly exceed this estimate. The field will be developed as a subsea tie-back into existing infrastructure. The K prospect well was our first exploration well and only our tenth well drilled in the Beryl area since acquiring the field in 2011. We look forward to demonstrating the future reserve and production growth potential at Beryl. Also in the Beryl area, Apache brought its first subsea development well on production at the Nevis Central field. The S67 well encountered 114 feet of net pay and achieved an initial production rate of approximately 11,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Egypt and the North Sea continued to provide excellent diversification to the Apache portfolio and reduced the overall volatility of our cash flow profile in this low oil price environment. Returns at $50 oil in these regions are very economic. And we plan to provide more detail around the portfolio depth and quality of these two businesses in the future. At the beginning of 2015, we established a conservative budget that assumed a $50 WTI and $53 Brent oil prices. Although prices came in above these levels in the first half of the year, the recent retreat in oil prices underscores the importance of our conservative budget and capital spending approach. As we enter the back half of 2015, Apache is achieving efficiency gains and cost reductions that are enabling us to increase our planned drilling and completion activities. In North America, we are now planning to run an average of 16 rigs in the second half of the year, 13 rigs of which will be in the Permian Basin, one will be in the Eagle Ford, and two will be drilling in the Woodford/SCOOP play. We now expect to reach total depth on approximately 40 wells to 50 more wells than our original 2015 plan, and to complete approximately 30 wells to 35 more wells than originally planned. Internationally, we plan to average 17 rigs in the second half of the year, which is down slightly from second quarter levels. However, we plan to complete approximately 15 wells to 20 more wells than previously planned, most of which are in Egypt. This incremental activity will positively impact our production trajectory as we enter 2016, while having only a minimal impact on our full-year 2015 production volumes. In conjunction with this activity increase, we are tightening our capital expenditure guidance range to between $3.6 billion and $3.9 billion. Apache is staying within our dramatically reduced capital spending budget, while at the same time exceeding our production goals for the year. Our strategy in this low oil and gas price environment is to continue working on our cost structure, continue investing in acreage and 3D seismic, and continue key play delineation and target testing such that when it is time to ramp up our drilling program, we will be doing so in the most efficient manner possible, which will maximize program rates of return and net present value. To sum up, we made very good progress in the second quarter. We completed our major asset sales and put our balance sheet in excellent shape. We reduced our drilling and completion program to levels that are appropriately aligned with the current commodity price environment. We realigned our regional operation structure to drive greater efficiency and technical collaboration. We made significant reductions in our run rate G&A and overhead costs. And we delivered strong production both domestically and internationally, which resulted in an increase to our 2015 guidance. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Steve Riney.
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, John, and good afternoon. As John said, we had a very good first half 2015 and we are very well positioned, even if the current low oil price environment persists. I would like to take some time to highlight the financial positioning of Apache and what we have accomplished in terms of driving down our cost structure consistent with the current price environment, utilizing divestment proceeds to reduce debt and to improve near-term liquidity, extending our credit facility to ensure liquidity through to June 2020, and aggressively adjusting our activity level to live within our means on an ongoing cash flow basis. But first, let me highlight the second quarter financial results. As noted in this morning's press release, Apache reported a GAAP loss of $5.6 billion or $14.83 per common share. This includes after-tax charges for a ceiling-test impairment of $3.7 billion, as well as $1.9 billion of other items, mostly after-tax losses and tax expense associated with the company's assets sold during the quarter. Our earnings for the quarter adjusted for these items were $82 million or $0.22 per share. As in the prior two quarters, we experienced a ceiling-test impairment in second quarter resulting from the continuing low price environment. Under full cost accounting, our upstream assets are carried at historical costs. Each quarter we compare this cost basis to a PV-10 value, calculated using trailing 12-month average oil and gas prices, held flat into perpetuity. To the extent the net book value exceeds the PV-10 valuation, the result is a ceiling-test write-down. We expect further ceiling-test impairments in the second half of 2015. As outlined in more detail in our 10-Q, based on June 30, 2015 forward strip prices. For the remainder of this year, we would expect to incur an additional $3.5 billion post-tax impairment. One notable impact of the ceiling-test impairments on our financial results going forward will be a reduction to our unit DD&A rate. For example, our DD&A per BOE during the second quarter was 20% lower than it otherwise would have been as a result of impairments taken in 4Q 2014 and 1Q 2015. Forward-looking impacts are uncertain as they will depend on many factors beyond just ongoing impairments. Let me now turn to costs. The following oil price environment and subsequent activity reduction across the industry has resulted in significant downward pressure on service costs, and we are generally seeing lower trends in most major cost categories. More specifically for Apache, much of the improvement in our cost structure is being driven by our belief that we should prepare ourselves for an extended period of lower prices. Accordingly, we have put considerable effort into poring over every aspect of our cost structure. Since the end of 2014, we have reduced head count by approximately 20%, consolidated certain regional offices, and streamlined the organizational structure. These actions are generating significant savings in our overhead cost structure. The measurement of overhead costs can be complex from an accounting perspective. A good proxy for our overhead cost structure is the gross cash spend for everything above the field. At the end of 2014, these costs were running approximately $1 billion annually. The combined effect of our portfolio changes and extensive efficiency efforts across the organization will bring our current run rate to below $750 million. Our goal is to enter 2016 at a run rate around $700 million. These overhead cost show up in our financial statements in various places. On average, about 20% typically appears in lease operating expense, 45% in expensed G&A, and 35% in capitalized G&A. Thus, these savings will manifest in many different ways. The bottom line, though, is it represents cash savings of about $300 million per year, which can now be better utilized to create shareholder value. On the lease operating expense side, our second quarter LOE was just over $9 per BOE, which is 13% lower than second quarter 2014. As John indicated, we believe in this price environment there will be continued downward pressure on all costs, and this includes lease operating expenses. Next, I would like to make a few comments regarding our balance sheet position and liquidity. While we've certainly accomplished a lot in terms of focusing our portfolio, we have also improved our overall financial strength. In particular, we have reduced debt levels, extended our credit facilities and we are now eliminating certain nearer-term debt maturities. Our proceeds from divestments enabled us to pay off $2.7 billion of short-term debt in the second quarter. We ended the quarter with long-term debt of $9.7 billion, and nearly $3 billion of cash, and have recently initiated steps to pay off $900 million of outstanding 2017 bonds. Following this, we will have no long-term debt maturing prior to 2018. As mentioned in our 1Q call, the sale of our foreign assets and the repatriation of the proceeds triggered a U.S. income tax payable of $560 million. Actual cash payment of this liability will occur in the second half of 2015, so I would like to point out that our current net debt of $6.7 billion should be considered as being closer to $7.3 billion. As of June 30, 2015, Apache held access to an undrawn commercial paper program backed by our $3.5 billion credit facility, which was recently extended through to June 2020. Combined with our current cash position and the maturity profile of our long-term debt, our liquidity is in very good shape. Having established this position, we are also working hard to protect it. As John has indicated many times, we are aggressively working to live within our means on a cash-flow basis. Obviously that was a difficult task for the first half of the year as prices declined rapidly and activity took time to ramp down. John spoke previously about our activity level for the second half of 2015. We are positioning our second half exploration and development activity at a pace that, if continued, would target cash flow neutrality for 2016. Our goal has been and continues to be to live within our means on a cash-flow basis. We have taken significant actions to achieve this and it has proven to be the prudent course. However, we want to balance these efforts with continued investment in an inventory of high quality opportunities that still work in this price environment. We have made great strides to position the company to be successful in a low-commodity-price environment. We knew that if we could be successful at $50 oil, we would certainly be successful at higher prices. The company is in a solid foundation with a healthy balance sheet, substantial liquidity and improving cost structure commensurate with the price environment, and a capital activity plan to live within our means as we enter 2016. We will remain opportunistic, but highly disciplined in the manner that we allocate capital in this challenging environment. I look forward to a successful second half of the year. And we'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Dave Tameron of Wells Fargo.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Congrats on a good quarter. John, how do you think about the price level here when you're at $45, versus $50, versus $40? And at what level would you see yourselves going the other way and pulling back a little bit?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Dave, I mean, I think the first thing is we took a more conservative approach earlier in the year when we kind of carved out a $50 budget back in February. So it's put us in a position where we've been counting the – trying to get our heads around what $50 means and working hard on our cost structure. You know, I think clearly with the – when you look at the activity increase, while we're adding back three rigs in North America, it's really going to be just one rig increase over what we ran in the second quarter. So we're trying to kind of streamline our activity with where we envision things would be in that price range, as you mentioned. I think the good news is we've got flexibility and as we're working on our plans for 2016 right now, we'll work on it even harder, but we've got flexibility to move up or down from this point. So the first thing was, was to kind of synchronize to this price environment and we'll maintain flexibility that we could ratchet down or ratchet up a little bit if necessary.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then just as a follow-up circling back to 2016, you mentioned within cash flow, you could show some, I think you said modest growth or you keep your production level, I guess, where it's at. Are you assuming the current strip? And then kind of, what framework, what metrics should we think about for 2016? Is it going to be within cash flow? Is that the driver there? Can you just talk more about that?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think that first of all, we've got a deep inventory, projects that work at low prices, so we feel good about the inventory. I think the key is, we do and we've said from the get-go this year we had a heavy outspend Q1. I think we did an excellent job of getting in line in Q2. So as we start to think about 2016, we do want to be in line within cash flow and kind of living within our means. We're working through our planning process right now in great detail, and as that becomes a little bit more clear and we think about it, as we work through it, we'll be able to give a little bit more color on the next call. But in general, I think the important thing is, we've proven what we can do this year on a much lower decreased CapEx budget. We've proven that our costs – our dollars are going further. And I think with the initiatives we have and the way the cost structure, the G&A, we're going to be able to do more with even less capital in 2016 if necessary.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of RBC.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, guys. Just, I wanted to see if I can get some comments on the current kind of M&A market. I know you guys had talked previously in the year about trying to grab more acreage and looking at acquisition opportunities.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Leo, two things. Number one, I think when you look at the acreage market out there, there's stuff off the beaten path that I think we'd be interested in. And we don't budget for that, but we're clearly always looking for things that work in low price environment. I think when you step back and look at the bigger picture M&A market right now, some of the price decks that have been used to justify some of those transactions I think have been relatively high. And I think if you go back to our portfolio, at $80 we've got a lot of inventory that works. And so from my standpoint, we would look at things incrementally. The good news is we've taken the steps to put our balance sheet in great shape, so we've got capacity, we've got a credit facility in place and we've aligned our cost structure and our activity levels to current so we've got lots of flexibility. And I think the key is, is we've got a good portfolio and it would have to be something that made sense incrementally to what we have in terms of what we could add. So I think in general, the market's been a little pricey. These last transactions have been using a higher deck than I think what's bearing out right now.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And I guess just thinking about your most resilient assets and where you have the deeper inventory in the low oil price environment here, should we continue to think Egypt and Permian get the lion's share of capital as you work your way into 2016?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: As we look at the back half of the year, we'll run approximately 16 rigs in North America. 13 rigs of those will be in the Permian. We'll have five in the Delaware, like we maintained all year. You'll have the other eight in our Midland Basin and Central Basin Platform/Northwest Shelf. You'll see us sprinkle a few more rigs into the Midland Basin second half of the year. You'll also see one rigs to two rigs from us in the Woodford, which is working quite well in the low price environment. And with the results that we mentioned on our Walker wells in the Eagle Ford, we're pretty excited about that as well. So when I look at North America, you'll see most of the work being in the Permian. Internationally, quite frankly, both Egypt and the North Sea compete very well and have great rates of return in terms of those projects. So we've scaled back there this year like we did in all the other areas, but we've got good inventory there. Look at what we're doing with Ptah and Berenice. I mean, we've now got 10 wells on, producing more than 23,000 barrels a day and that's constrained with facilities, there's room for that number to go higher and it's going higher as we speak. So I think we've got a lot of inventory at low prices that's going to keep us busy for a long time.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.
Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to focus on the Eagle Ford that you've spoken in the past about, some geologic complexities in this part of the Eagle Ford. With the results that you're reporting in Area A, do you feel like you've cracked a code there? Is there a code to be cracked? Can you talk to the well costs and where this play stands and ranks relative to some of your other opportunities?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Brian. I mean, it is a little more complex. You've got, as I've mentioned in the past, your geologic setting is critical as well as your fluid. I mean, you've got everything from a dry gas to a black oil. You've got a wet gas, a volatile oil in there. There is higher clay content. It's a little thinner. So I think one of the key areas we have been able to make some progress on our completion procedures. And the latest four wells we brought on, the two Walkers and the two Raes, I think if you look at the two Walker wells, those wells in a little over three months have produced 83,000 barrels and 80,000 barrels of just oil alone. So we're pretty excited about those results. Well costs are in the low $7 million range and we feel really good about the economics. So, I mean, I think we've definitely made some progress. We're still working spacing. We will put a rig back to work there and continue to highlight the fairway there. But a big breakthrough for us technically on the fracking side.
Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. And then I wanted to shift to the Midland Basin and the Wildfire area in Midland County is an area you reported some good results. Can you talk about the running room there at Wildfire? And then if we look outside Barnhart at your Midland position, is this the area that has the greatest running room that you're most excited about, or would you highlight other parts of the portfolio within the Midland Basin?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: If you go back, the best place to go back and look at our portfolio there would be our November 20 update. We kind of circled the four counties. We showed around 200,000 acres as I recall. In addition to Wildfire, we've got our Powell-Miller area, we've got our Azalea area. We've got a lot of running room in there. We've really just had a rig or two working. So we're very encouraged. It's an area we've got room to add. If you go back to our November update, we were planning to run eight to ten rigs. We'll probably have two to four or five rigs in there roughly this back half of this year. So we've got a lot of running room and we're very encouraged by the results. We're also taking a pretty measured approach on our flow backs. We've been experimenting with the frac procedures. We've taken some of those up to 3,000 pounds per foot. So we're making headway in there and feel good about the inventory.
Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of John Freeman of Raymond James.
John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good afternoon. Just some questions on the backlog that you all laid out. You said at the end of the year you'd have roughly 80 to 100 drilled uncompleted wells. I think you ended last year around 200 wells. And I'm just trying to get a sense, would you consider kind of a normal backlog at somewhere around two wells to three wells per rig?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That would be a little high. What we'd say a normal backlog. You know, when we were blowing and going, we were down to maybe 1.5 wells per rig. Some of the pads, you'll get a few more. If you go back to, we actually came into 2015 with 216 wells in backlog, and I think about 45 wells of those were verticals. So when you look at our horizontal backlog, it was in the 160 to 170 range. I think the number was 166 wells. We've kind of guided to 80 to 100. And that number may creep up, but we feel good about that range. So it's going to be a little higher, and that's just a function of still keeping an eye on prices and keeping a handle on our CapEx spend in this low price environment.
John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then just my one follow up along those same lines. I was a little surprised in the Permian that uncompleted backlog on the horizontal wells, it basically stayed flat despite going from 15 rigs to 10 rigs. Is there anything unusual that maybe caused that?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, when we backed off for the first part of the year, the completion costs hadn't come down yet. And right now we've currently got two frac crews in the northern portion of that and we've got two in the south, and we're just going at it very methodically. And so there's clearly room to accelerate, but we don't see any reason. And obviously in hindsight, with this recent drop in prices, we've been prudent not to do that.
John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks, John. Good quarter.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin of Société Générale.
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC: Yeah, hey, John. In your ops report regarding the Delaware, you talked about doing different completions at Pecos Bend and Waha to eliminate water. What are you doing and how much could that save you on a cost basis going forward?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, John, one of the things that's not talked about a lot, we hear about the oil rates, we hear about the gas rates in the Delaware, we don't get a lot from other companies on the water rates. These wells are high pressure. The Delaware is characterized by very high pressure and you will get some very, very high water rates. And so we've been going in and really understanding our geology, using our 3D seismic, trying to understand how we want to complete these and buffer around areas where we can eliminate some of the water production. If we can take those water cuts down just a few percentage points, it makes a big difference, one on your cost, your LOE, because you're having to handle the water, not to mention your ultimate recoveries and that sort of thing. So we're trying to move the needle and produce these wells at higher ultimate oil cuts, and we're really trying to understand the geologic system and the framework to how to complete them.
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC: Great. Then in terms of restructuring your organization, where are your technical operational centers is based? I mean, you have one obviously in San Antonio, but where else?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we've got an unconventional center in San Antonio. We've got our regions now. We've maintained a really three super regions as we have called them. Permian we have a big presence out there, which is handling our Midland Basin and Central Basin Platform/North West Shelf, our San Antonio has our Delaware Basin and our unconventional technology center. In the Houston region now, we've consolidated by closing Tulsa and collapsed our central region properties in with our Gulf Coast and actually Canada now reports into that. And we also have a technology center here in Houston that does a lot of support around the world on kind of our EP technology. So not to mention our Corporate Reservoir Engineering Group here, our enhanced recovery, and some other things. So really Houston, San Antonio, and then our regional offices. And then our international, we still maintain our presence in Cairo for Egypt and Aberdeen for the North Sea.
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC: Great. Thanks.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, John.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Doug.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: We'll go with something more exotic than normal, but that's fine. A couple questions, if I may. First of all, if I could jump back to the Eagle Ford, the wells results continue to be pretty strong there. I just wonder if you could help us understand the relative attractiveness of pulling wells or pulling rigs out of the Eagle Ford in favor of some of the other areas as opposed to continuing with Eagle Ford activity. And in your answer maybe you could hit the HBP question as well, if you've got any issues there. And I've got a follow-up, please.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean I think the important thing there is we had to really focus in on the completion procedures and the geologic settings. And so actually backing down those rigs was a blessing for us. It's let us really spend some time. We've had a frac crew out there and we've done some work, and like I said, the last four wells we reported, we've made some significant progress in understanding the complexities geologically and what's going on in the Eagle Ford. When we start to look at the numbers today, it competes extremely well, which is why we're going to put a rig back in there. But we have got Woodford that competes very well as well as Permian, as well as some of our other areas. So we've got a deep inventory and a lot of areas competing for capital. And we're glad to be able to put it back to work in the Eagle Ford.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Are there any HBP issues in the Eagle Ford, John, that we should be aware of?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say the acreage that we want HBP, will have HBP. So clearly the fair way there is we're understanding that. I mentioned that it is not a blanket fluid system, and so it's important to understand your system. But the acreage, we're not worried about losing acreage that we'd want to hang onto.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you. My follow up is on (43:43).
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond of Simmons & Company.
Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International: Good afternoon, John. Thank you for taking my questions.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome, Pearce.
Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International: The first question is looking at your portfolio, I know this is hard to answer, but what do you think your base decline percentage is as kind of a whole company? And what do you think the maintenance CapEx is for the company to keep production flat?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean, if you look at our overall portfolio decline, we're in the 25% range. I mean, we highlighted in my prepared remarks today our Permian is around 22%. It's helped by our Central Basin Platform/North West Shelf. We're working through our planning process right now. And the one thing I would say is that if you look at 2015 relative to 2014, we now are going to show growth in North America on a significantly reduced CapEx program, but we're not in a position to give you guidance in terms of what would be "maintenance" in terms of – if you're asking maintaining flat production or that sort of thing.
Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International: Okay. Thank you. And then my follow-up: service costs, you've done a great job of bringing those down. Looking at the Ford strip, it sounds like your expectation as service costs move lower, but a lot of the service companies right now negative cash margin. Do you think that service costs continuing to come down is realistic at this point?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I mean, I think there's two things. Number one, we were probably the earliest out there on the service side, and if you look at our savings today to the 25%, there's probably more than half of that is operational things and logistics and things we've done to get better. My conversations with the service companies have moved to, this has never been about margin, we're just asking them, they've got to make the margin to have a healthy business. It's been, though, we've got to sit down and figure out how to work together and how they get smarter, and how we can take costs out of the system that don't need to be passed through. So bottom-line on, it is in a low price environment, it doesn't matter if you're operating at negative margin, you're going to have to find a way to get more creative and get your cost structure down. And I think it's a matter of us rolling up our sleeves, working with them, and finding creative ways to take costs out of the system, which is what we do and that's what's we'll – that's what's happening right now across the industry, and that's what we'll continue to do in the future. I mean, when you look at the numbers second quarter, the market had pretty well baked in recovery into the mid-$60s on oil price back half of the year. And clearly that's not – it doesn't look like that's the case, and so as a result, the cost side's going to have to come down and we're going to have to work together and get in the trenches and figure out how to lower them.
Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett of Sanford Bernstein.
Bob A. Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yeah, a question on your realizations in the international assets. North Sea and Egypt looked pretty strong. Is that a seasonal effect, or what's driving that?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I don't know if Steve, wants to add something. I think it's just a function of having Brent pricing and predominantly oil-driven revenues. And Tom Voytovich has another comment too.
Thomas E. Voytovich - EVP-International & Offshore Region: We get a pretty good gas price in the North Sea too, and our gas rates are up this year, so that's contributing to it as well.
Bob A. Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And another would be, what's your exit rate for December 31 of this year? Do you have a sense of what that might be?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, what we said is, if you look at our fourth quarter, December's going to be our highest month. So we're not in a position to give that number at this point. If you take our North American guidance, we gave numbers in terms of we got actuals first quarter, second quarter, 307,000 BOEs, 317,000 BOEs, gets you to 312,000 BOEs for the first half average. Our midpoint of our guidance range would be 307,000 BOE for the year, which means you average 302,000 BOE the back half. We've said third quarter is going to be under that and fourth quarter we're going to see a nice rebound, so and I think there's room in those numbers. So with that, it's about all I'll say at this point. And we guided to kind of 164,000 BOE to 168,000 BOE on our international. And it's going to be probably relatively flat.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors: Thanks. Good morning. I guess I wanted to follow-up a little bit on your comment about keeping production relatively stable within cash flow for 2016. Is that intended to mean stable year-on-year 2015 – or 2016 versus 2015, or stable from the exit rate in 2015?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I mean that clearly we're not giving full color. I think what we've looked at and if you look at how we've been able to stretch capital this year, with where our cost structures are and the quality of our inventory, we feel like we can be relatively stable, and it would be more year-over-year. But we'll come out with something more definitive at the appropriate time.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors: Okay. Great. And then as a follow-up, you've done some great jobs on the overhead cost reductions. I appreciate all that extra granularity. Just curious, as you guys are looking at 2016 and beyond, you had a much larger rig count obviously, and activity level in 2015 – or sorry, 2014. What sort of activity level are you gearing the company for, or sizing the company for from an overhead perspective? I don't know if you put that in terms of rigs or what, but I'm just kind of trying to think through if there are more overhead reductions to come in 2016, or is it kind of already been done, and at what sort of activity level can it support?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we've been gearing our cost structure to a $50 price environment. The thing I would say though is, with the efficiencies and things we're doing today, it will not take the number of rigs in the future in a higher price environment, so I mean, I think we've got – we've set this thing up to where it's kind of an accordion that can take on a lot more activity, but we tried to gear it towards the low price environment because what I can't do is be wasting dollars in terms of G&A that I should be putting in the ground that can be generating results. And so we've tried to get real frugal on where we need to be, and then in typical Apache fashion, we feel pretty good. We've got a footprint in place that will expand fairly significantly because I think what we've done this year has been really healthy. We needed – as Apache and quite frankly as an industry – to look at our overall cost structure, even in a high-price environment. And we feel real good about where we are and how we've geared it and that we're definitely prepared for lower prices.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade of Johnson Rice.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Yes. Good afternoon, John, to you, and your team there. If I could go back to a question that you touched on before, in your operations report, you mentioned that you had 70 horizontal wells in the Permian drilled and completed here at mid-year. Does that – how does that interact? Or how does that drilled and completed count progress as we go through the back half of the year? I guess what I'm really after is, are you really planning on working that down in late 3Q, early 4Q. And that's why we're going to see the bump-up?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm going to let Tim Sullivan, who I have not let him handle a question yet. But I'll let Tim, jump in and talk through those numbers a little bit for you.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support: Okay. For the Permian Basin, for our drilled and uncompleted wells, we're at about 40 right now. And as we work through the back half of the year and with our rig activity, we're going to exit the year at down to about 25 to 30 throughout the year, at the end of the year.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it. And you said you're 40 – you're at 40 right now, you said?
Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support: In the Permian Basin...
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: About 45. We're at 45.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support: We're at 45, right now.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. All right. Thank you for that, Tim. And then if I could go back to some of Steve's comments...
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me back up there. We're at, like, 70 right now. We'll end the year at about 45 with total Permian.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it. And so that includes – when you say total Permian, that's vertical and horizontal? Or what's the distinction there?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: 43 – it's going to be 50. We're roughly – we're projecting about 52, if you add verticals and horizontals for combined Permian.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Thank you, John. And then shifting over to more of balance sheet philosophy sort of question, and this might be for Steve, Steve, I appreciate you giving us the forecast of what's going to happen with the balance sheet here in the back half of the year, and I know that all of you guys there have worked really hard to put the balance sheet in the good shape it's in right now. But philosophically as you – you talked about – you're working on a – you're working in a $50 world, philosophically, what kind of constraints do you want to keep on your balance sheet, whether it's in terms of debt-to-EBITDA or some other relevant metric? And what are the circumstances that you'd have to see that would make either one lever up? Or use your balance sheet for a transaction?
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, Charles. I think at this point and in this environment as of today, I think that the balance sheet in the shape that we've got it right now is probably pretty good. And I'd prefer – my philosophy would be, at this point in time we just keep it where it is. We may look at paying down some further debt. We'll look at that as we go through the second half, look at what the price environment is doing. And we get a really solid view of 2016 as we round out the planning. But right now I think the best thing to do is for us to sit on the balance sheet that we have. It's a good strong one. It's highly liquid and it's one that would allow us to be opportunistic if we felt like the compelling opportunity came along. I think John hit the nail on the head a few minutes ago, and that is that the opportunities that we've seen and we've seen some other people jump at, we wouldn't have put those under the column called, compelling, at this point in time. And it's just not something that we would be willing to sacrifice the balance sheet for in any material way.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Kelly of Global Hunter Securities.
Michael Kelly, CFA - Global Hunter Securities: Hi, guys. I was hoping you could maybe give us a bit of a preview of what's to come with this capital allocation review that you're going to unveil next quarter. And I'm really trying to get a sense of whether we should expect potential major strategy shift with this, the portfolio get shaken up quite a bit? Or is this more modest alterations around the edges? Thanks.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I would say in general, if you look at where we are today, you look at the rig count we're running and you look at the price environment, I don't have a crystal ball out there what's going to look like in a couple of months, but it's probably pretty similar, I mean we've done a good job this year. We're really drilling the things we want to drill. We don't have an area where we are in what I'd call development mode, with the exception of maybe our Ptah and Berenice area in Egypt. So as you start to think about going forward, I think capital is going to go to the best places, but we've got it in those projects that are working the best right now. And as you think about the incremental capital back half of the year, we're putting a little bit back to work in the Eagle Ford. We're putting a little bit back to work in the Woodford and obviously in the Permian in conjunction with our international.
Michael Kelly, CFA - Global Hunter Securities: Okay. Great. If I go over to the Permian and the Delaware. It was good to hear that the Delaware well cost down 35%. If you go back to that November 20 presentation, you guys had 100% IRRs out there but a much higher oil price. Just wondering if you could talk about kind of mark-to-market today, lower costs, lower oil price, what project return you could be looking at right now? And then just the scale of the inventory there, the opportunity set that's really core Delaware. Thanks.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll let Tim Sullivan jump in on this one.
Timothy J. Sullivan - Senior Vice President-Operations Support: Yeah, with the well costs we're seeing out there, about $5.8 million. And the IPs that we're currently seeing, we're well above our type curves. And even at the $50 oil price, we're seeing above 40% rate of returns out of the Pecos Bend area.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of James Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors.
James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Just sticking with the Permian for a second. There was a comment in the prepared remarks about a second landing zone in the third Bone Spring. Is that an option for stack development? And can you speak to how prevalent that appears to be? It may be early days on it, but any detail you might have.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right now we're looking at them as individual zones, just another well that can be drilled from the pads. And the good news is we've got a full pad in and they're pretty compelling. And we're not in communication. And the second zone is performing really in line with the primary zone.
James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Okay. Sounds great. So just maybe pulling back a little bit on the question of science work. And I did notice you guys pulled the rig out of Canyon. That might have been part of the plan that you guys were working on. But just in terms of high-grading the portfolio, how do you guys manage the balance between trying to allocate capital to areas that are going to be sure bets in terms of delivering program rate of return cash flows and doing more experimental work like in the Canyon and elsewhere, where you've got stuff you don't know yet and maybe costs that needs to come down, just philosophically?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, you've got to look at the areas where you think you've got the most impact or running room. And the real driver is you can't lower costs if you don't put a rig in there. And a lot of what we're doing this year is strategic testing, like the second landing zone in the third Bone Spring. We've just got to look at those and see how they stack up and see how many and then we'll go to work on that. But very few places right now in North America are we parking rigs on pads and trying to develop things. I think it's a function of right now setting up opportunities and really continuing to line our cost structure and get our returns at the levels we want before we'd go back to work with major development programs.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Edward Westlake of Credit Suisse.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks for squeezing me in at the top of the hour here. Just on the last comment you made about getting into development mode. No one has focused on this today, but say the oil price does go back up to the sort of $65 range that I think you referenced on the last call for some of the plays. How aggressive could you be in terms of the number of rigs that you could add over the next two years to three years? That's my first question and I have a quick follow-up.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, in terms of the number of rigs, I think we could add as many as we wanted to. We were running 93 last fall. So that's not hard. It will all come down to cash flow and economics and where's the cost structure. So what will be the driver – and we've been real consistent on that theme all year, is it takes the cash flow from our operations to be able to drive our programs. Over the long haul, we can go to the balance sheet from time to time if we felt like there was an opportunity. But in general, we want to be balanced and living within our means. And so it will be a function of the cash flow that we have to reinvest versus what other opportunities are out there.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And then follow on is on the international CapEx. I mean, it's still running something like $650 million in Egypt on an annual basis, if I just annualize your first half and $800 million in the North Sea. Any opportunity to get some deflation or activity cycling as you go forward to get some savings there in the CapEx program?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We are seeing savings there. The one thing in Egypt, you really never had the run up from 2009 on the rigs that you had in the service side in North America. So dollars go further, which is why we've been running a number of rigs in Egypt. When you look at the North Sea, we've had a lot of success. The one thing we haven't talked about is we sanctioned a project that's pretty critical to us. It's Aviat. It's a $200 million project over two years. It's in the numbers now this year. We're going to spend about $100 million. But the big deal on that is we're going to convert the field to field gas from diesel. And it's a very economic project, it makes great rate of return. But the big deal is is it's going to be safer, it's going to be environmentally friendly and it's going to give us field gas supply where we're not having to bunker diesel to well into a 2030 timeframe. So it's an important project. It's about $100 million. That's part of what's in that North Sea number this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Yes. Good afternoon. You mentioned earlier a balanced CapEx program. Do you think the capital spent on North America onshore versus international offshore this year, which is roughly 60/40, is that balanced enough? And does that really change depending on what part of the commodity cycle we're in?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, clearly we look at the opportunities, we look at the running room and we look at the economics of the projects. And the good news is we've got a great inventory in general. The international portfolio is less sensitive to the drop in prices, so it's a little more buffered on the returns. And then on the North America side, you can generate in some areas a little bit more NPV. So it's a balanced approach. We like where our mix is right now. We're generating cash, cash out of both Egypt and the North Sea. And that's kind of directionally where we want to stay. But right now we like that mix, and think it's serving us very well.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just a quick question on the Mid-continent program. You're spending some capital in the Woodford/SCOOP area, but not much in the context of the whole portfolio. So I was just wondering if you can comment on the 50,000 net acres you've got there today, and just maybe provide some context around how sustainable you think that is for a company of Apache's size. Thanks.
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, number one it's, we've got about 50,000 net acres that's predominantly Grady County. We've got a rig in there, we're going to put another one in, the economics work very well. Yeah, it's material, and it's material to that portion of our portfolio. Most of the acreage has been purchased in there, but we've got some nice positions that are clearly very economic at low prices, and clearly, we've got a lot of running room to develop on that acreage position. So it's not something we're looking to scale up necessarily, just because most of it has already been gotten, but we've got really economic projects in there and it can make an impact.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I just wanted to hear it one more time. Sorry. Guys, I had a follow-up that I don't think – I think that your operator thought that my follow-up was a clarification point. Anyway, Egypt, John. Obviously at the beginning of the year, you decided that this was going to be a core part of the portfolio. So I'm just kind of trying to understand this step-up in exploration activities. Is that something that has been a deliberate change in reallocating capital? I'm thinking with the PSC, you get the money back fairly quickly. And if so, what is the exploration or drilling backlog look like for Egypt on the go-forward plan?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Doug, it's really more driven off of technology. I mean, we've got the seismic 3D interpretations and so forth. Our success rate, we're drilling fewer wells than we drilled last year, but we announced a 78% success rate and it's really just a function of the quality, the technical work we're undoing in unlocking the basin, and a lot of these stratigraphic areas and traps with the 3D seismic, we're just getting better, and we've got a better handle on the system.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And so is Egypt cash flow positive in the current environment?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Absolutely.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great stuff. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis of Capital One Securities.
Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon, John. Quick question: looking at the Delaware Basin, I noticed the Bone Spring completions during the second quarter. While it's solid, it looked to be a little bit lower in oil cut and productivity per lateral foot than those Condor wells that you reported in the first quarter. Anything done differently drilling those Condor wells, or was it just a particularly sweet spot?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I mean, I think it's going to be spacing and just the area that you're in within that Bone Spring. They're completed very similarly. So it's just a function of the area where you are.
Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.: And how much acreage does Apache have in that Pecos Bend area?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Pecos Bend is actually pretty small. I mean, you'd have to go back and look at our ops report. I think we're in the 7,000 acres to 8,000 acres in there. It's not a very big area, but it shows you how many landing zones we've got in a really nice little development area right there.
Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.: All right. That's it for me. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question and our last question, I should say, comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers.
Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good afternoon. My fist question is just broadly looking throughout the various plays, your Permian 30 day rates look pretty strong. I was just wondering, are you practicing any rate restriction in any of the portions of the Permian?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Actually, Jeff, we are. I mean, we have gone to some managed chokes and we're doing some things there right now that are helping us. And we have also been very focused on our completions and sand concentrations and so forth.
Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then kind of taking Tom's remarks about the UK gas market in mind, the high rate S67 well, is that predominantly a nat-gas well and does it de-risk other potential similar locations?
John J. Christmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Tom?
Thomas E. Voytovich - EVP-International & Offshore Region: Indeed it does. It is a high rate gas well. In fact it's making about $50 million a day right now which is at the gas price we're getting, that's pretty much parity with oil right now on a BOE basis. There are other opportunities out there. We're just now getting started with our exploitation and exploration program of the recent 3D seismic, but there are more opportunities just like this in the field pays. These are individual fault blocks that were heretofore unseen or untouched at least.
Operator: And there are no further questions in the queue.
Gary T. Clark - Vice President-Investor Relations: Okay. Well, thank you, everybody. We look forward to speaking with you all on the next quarter conference call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Fia and I will be the conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation First Quarter Earnings 2015 Conference. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark. Sir, you may begin.
Gary T. Clark - Vice President-Investor Relations: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on Apache Corporation's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today's call will be Apache's CEO and President, John Christmann; and CFO, Steve Riney. Also joining in the room today is Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President and COO of International. In conjunction with this morning's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our quarterly earnings supplement, which summarizes our operational activities and well highlights across various Apache operating regions. The supplement also includes information on our capital expenditures for the quarter, as well as a chart that illustrates cash sources and uses, and reconciles Apache's change in net debt during the first quarter of 2015. Our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations, and our quarterly earnings supplement can all be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com. I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. This morning, we reported a first quarter 2015 loss of $4.7 billion or $12.34 per diluted share, which includes an after-tax ceiling-test write down of $4.7 billion, primarily related to the impact of declining oil and gas prices. When adjusted for certain items that impact the comparability of results, the first-quarter loss totaled $139 million or $0.37 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital totaled $900 million during the quarter. Worldwide reported net production averaged 601,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with liquids production constituting 62% of the total. I would now like to turn the call over to John.
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Gary. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a successful first quarter on several fronts. Operationally, we executed a very rapid and efficient downsizing of our drilling program. On a go-forward basis, our reduced program better aligns capital expenditures with cash flow in this depressed oil and gas price environment. Specifically, we decreased our North American rig count by 77%, from 65 rigs on December 31 to 15 rigs by the end of the first quarter. We are highly focused on reducing all elements of our cost structure. On the capital side, we were fortunate to enter this downturn with minimal long-term rig contracts and very few acreage exploration issues. As a result, we were able to quickly adjust our costs, and now project that total drilling and completion costs will ultimately be down between 20% and 40% in 2015 from the levels we disclosed for our key plays at our North American update in November. And compared to 2014, we are on track to achieve an overall 25% reduction in average drilling and completion costs. As the year progresses, we anticipate capturing potentially more savings. With regard to G&A, over the past 18 months Apache has divested a substantial number of operated properties and exited several operational areas. Our smaller footprint now requires less overhead and a more prudent approach to spending. Every dollar we save in corporate overhead can be recycled into our asset base to generate a return for our shareholders. We are structuring Apache's organization, planning functions and operational teams to provide maximum flexibility to respond to commodity price changes and cash flow availability. We have budgeted conservatively at $50 WTI for the year. And while first quarter oil prices came in a little below that level, the second quarter is off to a good start. Should oil prices stabilize at these higher levels and cash flow increase accordingly, we are well-positioned to ramp up the drilling program in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Despite a significant reduction in drilling and completion activity, we were able to minimize our first quarter production decline in North America from record fourth quarter levels. We also encountered some significant weather challenges in our Permian and Central regions during the quarter. However, North American onshore production still exceeded the high end of our guidance range. On the international side, Egypt and the North Sea both outperformed our expectations during the quarter, primarily on the strength of successful delineation drilling and better than expected well performance. Australian operations were generally on track in Q1. However, production was adversely impacted by two cyclones that hit late in the quarter. Turning to our capital spending; during the quarter, capital expenditures before LNG, capitalized interest and Egypt's minority interest was $1.3 billion. This represents approximately 36% of our full-year 2015 capital budget, the midpoint of which has been reduced to $3.65 billion. CapEx was in line with our expectations for the quarter and consistent with our commentary on last quarter's call that we were coming into 2015 hot on activity and capital. Given the magnitude and success of our first quarter activity and spending ramp down, we remain confident in our 2015 CapEx guidance. Also, despite our significantly lower activity levels for the rest of the year, we remain comfortable with our pro forma North American onshore production guidance of relatively flat compared to 2014. In summary, it was a very good quarter both domestically and internationally. And I'll provide a little more detail on the regions in a moment. Since the last earnings call, we have made excellent progress on our portfolio repositioning initiatives. In April, we announced the closing of our Wheatstone and Kitimat LNG assets along with a definitive agreement to sell the remainder of our Australian oil and gas assets. We expect to close the Australian asset sale around mid-year and our updated capital and production guidance provided in this morning's press release takes into account this assumption. In his prepared remarks, Steve Riney will discuss how we plan to utilize the $5.8 billion of proceeds from these transactions. I'd like to now make some comments about our operating regions and also provide some color on our projected year-end horizontal well backlog. As I noted earlier, we substantially reduced our drilling and completion activity during the first quarter. In North America, we completed 42% fewer total wells compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. More importantly, we deferred our scheduled horizontal completion count in anticipation of better pressure pumping pricing from our third-party vendors. For example, we completed only 84 operated horizontal wells in North America during the first quarter compared to 153 operated horizontals during the fourth quarter of 2014. Despite these activity reductions, our first quarter North American production averaged 307,000 BOEs per day and exceeded our guidance range of 300,000 BOEs per day to 305,000 BOEs per day. In our Permian region, production grew 6% compared to the first quarter of 2014, but decreased by roughly 10,000 BOEs per day or approximately 6% from record levels in the fourth quarter of 2014. The majority of this sequential quarterly decrease of approximately 7,800 BOEs per day is attributable to severe winter weather-related downturn. In fact, had we not encountered weather-related shut-ins during the quarter, our oil volumes in the Permian would have been roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter. Assuming no change from our currently budget activity levels, we anticipate the Permian oil production will increase gradually for the remainder of the year, while natural gas production should remain relatively flat. The Permian production increase in 2015 will be driven by the Delaware Basin, where we anticipate generating significant volume growth from 28 wells scheduled for completion in the second and the fourth quarter. Key Permian Basin well completions during the quarter included two very strong Delaware Basin horizontal wells; the Condor 205H and 206H in our Pecos Bend area and three solid horizontal wells with relatively short laterals at our Powell-Miller area of the Southern Midland Basin. On a lateral adjusted foot basis, all of these wells produced at 30-day average IP rates above the representative tight curves, which were presented at our November update. In particular, the Condor wells in Delaware Basin, which have been online for just over two months are substantially outperforming expectations. We look forward to drilling more wells in both of these areas during 2015 and reporting results in the coming quarters. We are making good progress in reducing drilling and completion costs, particularly in the Delaware Basin, where we plan to be the most active this year. The previously mentioned Condor wells were drilled and completed for around $6 million. This represents a 25% reduction from the $8 million well costs we provided in our November update. On the Central Basin Platform, we completed a large number of very economic vertical wells from our 2014 backlog and completed two exceptional horizontal wells in our North Monahans area that produced a 30-day average IPs in excess of 1,000 BOEs per day. In April, we completed our highest IP well ever in our Barnhart area, the Scott Sugg West Unit H11U, which is producing more than 1,000 BOEs per day. Also in April, we put on production our first four Midland County wells in the Wildfire area along with our first well in the Azalea area near the Midland-Glasscock County line. Early results from these core Midland County wells look very encouraging, and it's fair to say that this activity has positioned us well for a good start in the second quarter in the Permian. Turning to the Central region, production was down 2% sequentially from the fourth quarter after adjusting for asset sales. This was expected following our significant reduction in activity. During the first quarter, we completed only 24 gross operated wells compared to 51 gross operated wells during the fourth quarter. Apache's primary focuses today in the Central region are the Canyon Lime and the Woodford plays. The Canyon Lime is a tremendous source rock with significant oil in place, but due to the recent drop in oil prices, we have slowed our drilling pace and turned our attention to optimizing our approach and reducing costs in the area. We have made some significant breakthroughs on the cost side in the Canyon Lime. Drilling costs in our two most recent wells came in around $4.25 million. Completion costs on these well should be roughly $2.75 million each, which means that all in, we believe we can develop this play for about $7 million per well excluding facilities costs. This is also almost 20% lower than the $8.5 million well costs that we showed at our November update. We brought online our 93H pad during the first quarter and the flow back has been somewhat limited as a result of an extended third-party plant outage. Regardless, these wells appear to be tracking in line with their type curve. We have various tests underway in the Canyon Lime that will help optimize the play and prepare for future rig ramp up. Under the improved cost structure I noted above, our Canyon Lime inventory starts to become economic at around $60 or $65 per barrel, and we believe there is significant opportunity to improve the economics as we advance the play. That said, the Canyon Lime will still need to compete for capital on an NPV and rate of return basis with our other plays. To-date, we have drilled 14 wells in the lower Canyon Lime, 12 of which are online and producing. As of March 31, we had a backlog of four wells drilled but uncompleted in the play. In the Anadarko Basin, we are currently acquiring seismic and delineating roughly 50,000 net acres in the Woodford Springer play, also referred to industry as the SCOOP. We're currently drilling a two-well pad in Grady County and are planning to drill and complete a few additional Woodford wells later in the year. A tremendous amount of science and testing is also underway in our Eagle Ford play. To-date, we have drilled in four primary operating areas; Reveille, Ferguson Crossing, Remington and Brazos Riverside and have materially advanced our understanding of this intricate resource play. We have now drilled a total of 86 wells in the Eagle Ford, 45 of which are online and producing. Lithology and hydrocarbon phases change fairly significantly in Northern Eagle Ford. We're continuing to test optimal drilling and completion methods, frac designs and well spacing. Each of these inputs can vary materially depending on the hydrocarbon phase window and clay count of the area. In Area A, which is generally characterized by higher gas/oil ratios, the drilling is a bit more complex and expensive due to depletion in the chalk above the Eagle Ford. Our current drilling and completion cost target is around $6.5 million, which is down more than 20% from the $8.4 million we cited back in November. In Area B, which is a bit shallower, we estimate drilling and completion costs will be around $6 million per well, which is down roughly 15% from previous estimates. We have a large backlog of wells to complete in the Eagle Ford, and while we may not get to all of them this year, we can expect this play will contribute to our North American oil growth in 2015 and 2016. Like the Canyon Lime, we anticipate becoming a more active driller in the Eagle Ford when oil price approaches the $65 per barrel level. In Canada, we had a good quarter. Weather-related downtime was minimal, and production decreased only modestly from the fourth quarter 2014 levels, despite reduced completion activity. During the quarter, we generated positive results in a new lower-cost oil-rich area of the Montney, which we call Ante Creek. We have some running room there; however, more infrastructure will be needed to bring these wells online. We also successfully tested the very thick lower Montney formation for the first time in our Wapiti area and believe it will have minimal communication with the currently productive horizons in the upper Montney. In the Duvernay, we just completed drilling our first seven-well pad in the Kaybob area and look forward to completing those wells and bringing on some significant volumes during the quarter. Turning to our international operations; in Australia, our production averaged 59,400 BOEs per day, which was down from the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we had unanticipated production shut-ins for approximately 2,600 BOEs per day due to the impact of two cyclones that hit the region. Otherwise, the ramp up of our Coniston and Van Gogh fields remains on schedule, as does the planned sale of all of our Australian oil and gas assets by mid-year. In Egypt, the successful delineation of our Ptah and Berenice fields has led to a recent gross production rate of more than 19,600 barrels of oil per day from seven wells. This month, we plan to place one more delineation well online and increase production to approximately 22,000 barrels of oil per day. Several other new field discoveries have been made across multiple concession areas subsequent to quarter-end. As a result, Egypt is tracking very well against our production outlook from February 12. Apache's production in the North Sea decreased as expected from a record high in the fourth quarter of 2014, but was up 5% relative to the first quarter of 2014. One of the two main electrical transformers failed on our Beryl Alpha platform, resulting in two weeks of unplanned downtime. This translated into a 2,600 BOE per day net production hit for the first quarter. Our North Sea team responded quickly and commendably to this incident and managed to keep our production tracking in line with plan. Subsequent to quarter-end, we logged significant pay at new wells in both the Beryls and Forties areas, and there's a high degree of confidence in our 2015 North Sea production outlook, after adjusting for the sale of our non-op interest in the Scott and Telford fields. We're excited about our recently processed 700 square mile 3D seismic survey covering the Beryl field complex and adjoining area. This is the first seismic survey conducted over this field since 1997. From the higher resolution of the extensive data set, a number of interesting features have surfaced in terms of potentially material exploration targets and lower risk in field drilling opportunities. We look forward to testing these later in the year and in 2016. Since our fourth quarter call back in February, we've received a lot of questions about our inventory work off in 2015 and our projected drilled but uncompleted well inventory going into 2016. Let me quickly provide you a few numbers that may be helpful for modeling purposes. We entered 2015 with 207 drilled but uncompleted wells at our North American onshore backlog, 80% of which were horizontals. Based on our current plan, we expect to exit 2015 with between 80 and 100 drilled but uncompleted wells, essentially all of which will be horizontals. I would stress that this assumes that we do not add any additional rigs in the second half of the year. During this period of depressed oil and gas prices, Apache is not standing still. Though, we have reduced our rig count, we continue to move forward on multiple initiatives that will strengthen the company. I believe these initiatives will help transform our operational and financial results and ultimately drive incremental shareholder value. I mentioned them last quarter and would like to close by reiterating them here again today. We are realigning our North American incentive program to reward continuous improvement and cost discipline. We are developing detailed medium and longer term field development plans and continue to high grade and build our drilling inventory at multiple price scenarios. We are continuing to invest heavily in seismic acquisition, processing, and other technical services to provide a more thorough understanding of our acreage and optimize our drilling and completion techniques. We are focused on quick payout, high return work over and re-completion projects that protect our North American production base, and we're consolidating and enhancing our portfolio through opportunistic acreage additions, where there is less competition and lower prices. I have confidence in the positive impact of these initiatives and I'm excited about our people, our acreage, and our strategy. Despite the commodity price challenges the entire industry faces, I believe Apache will finish this year as a much stronger company then when we began it. I will now turn the call over to our new CFO, Steve Riney, who I am very pleased to have on board. He has only been here a few short months, but has already made a significant impact on our organizational capabilities. Steve?
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, John, and good afternoon. It's great to be a member of the Apache team. And I have to say, it's everything I hoped it would be and more. In my three months in the role, I have spent most of my time getting to know the business and the people and understanding how we do things. I have been very impressed with our team. They're dedicated to always doing the right thing and to growing value for our shareholders. We also have a terrific set of assets that are more than capable of delivering on that same goal of growing value. Before I dive into the first quarter performance discussion, I thought I would share some of my emerging views on top priorities with respect to the role of finance at Apache. There are two particular areas where I am focusing my near-term attention: planning and capital allocation. I have a firm belief that finance plays a key role in stewarding the value proposition for our shareholders. We don't do this alone. There are many others who lead very important elements, but finance plays a vital role in bringing a dispassionate view into the planning process and the capital allocation process. In planning, we're working to pull together a high-quality view of the next five years as well as to develop a dynamic planning process. Planning is where opportunity and expectations become aligned. Shareholders have expectations with respect to operational performance, financial delivery, and growth. So, there is an element of what we must deliver in the planning process. Our portfolio presents our current opportunity set. This is where planning addresses the question of what can we deliver. Getting these two views aligned builds confidence that long-term delivery is on track, and this is what we're trying to accomplish. We're working the plan with three price scenarios in mind: a low case of flat $50 WTI; a high case of a rise to $80 WTI, and then flat; and a base case of the five-year strip. Recent oil price volatility reminds us we have little control over the price environment and underscores the importance of being prepared to take any necessary steps to correct our course. We are redesigning the planning process to significantly improve our visibility into the potential impacts of price movements across the portfolio, so we are prepared to rebalance the activity set accordingly. Of course, price does not move in a vacuum, and we will take into account that costs move in tandem with prices, and may do so in very different ways for the various pieces of our portfolio. In some places, costs can move very quickly with price movements, potentially providing a natural hedge. In other places, the cost reaction could move much slower. The capital allocation process is how the plan gets implemented. We have a tremendous variety of opportunities in our global portfolio, and we are working to improve our understanding of how the economics of every element of the portfolio work. It can be more complicated than it is sometimes portrayed and an appropriate depth of understanding gives confidence that the best opportunities are getting funded, and they are truly adding value for our shareholders. We're also working to establish a strong linkage between the investment economics view of the portfolio and the long-term plan view. It is not enough to understand the depth of economic opportunities in the portfolio. We need to understand how that depth changes in different price environments. And finally, the various price assumptions in the plan and the corresponding cash flow generation will establish the pace at which the portfolio of opportunities can actually be funded. So, we have a lot of important work to do, but we are already on our way and we have a plan for taking this forward. Now, let me turn to some of the details of our first quarter results. John and Gary reviewed our earnings and key operational drivers for the quarter, so I'll make a few comments about our ceiling-test write down, planned use of proceeds from recent asset sales, and our 2015 capital spending outlook. I'll then finish up with some directional guidance for the year on a few other items. As noted in this morning's press release, we reported an after-tax ceiling-test write down of $4.7 billion or $12.48 per share for the first quarter of 2015. This is a result of the current commodity price environment. Under full cost accounting, our upstream assets are carried at historical cost. Each quarter, we compare this cost basis to a calculated PV-10 value. To the extent the net book value exceeds the PV-10 valuation, the result is a ceiling-test write down. The ceiling-test employs a methodology prescribed by the SEC, which uses trailing 12-month average oil and gas prices. The PV-10 calculation assumes these average prices are held flat into perpetuity. The prices for the last two quarters have dramatically reduced our PV-10 calculation. In addition, since today's trailing 12-month prices still reflects several months of higher prices from last year. If prices do not recover materially, you can expect further impairments during the remainder of 2015. In terms of our planned use of asset divestment proceeds, in April we received $3.7 billion of proceeds from our LNG transaction with Woodside, and approximately $560 million of U.S. income taxes has become payable as a result of repatriating these funds. Of the remaining $3.1 billion, $2.6 billion were used in April to pay off commercial paper in short-term bank loans, which you will see on the balance sheet at the end of the first quarter. Around mid-year, we anticipate receiving an additional $2.1 billion, subject to customary post-closing adjustments, upon closing the sale of our remaining Australian oil and gas assets. We plan to use these proceeds in combination of further debt reduction and cash retention. On page three of our earnings supplement, we provide a net debt reconciliation for the first quarter. On that same page, we present a pro forma view of our actual net debt at March 31 to reflect the asset sale proceeds expected in the second quarter. With this pro forma view, you'll see that our net debt is less than $7 billion, which is less than two times our projected 2015 EBITDA, assuming $50 WTI and $53 Brent. Turning to capital spending; we continue to anticipate North American CapEx, excluding LNG, to be in a range of $2.1 billion to 2.3 billion. We have no current intentions to expand the planned activity set in North America during 2015. However, if rising oil prices and continued capital efficiency result in 2015 cash flow significantly above plan levels, this may change, and as John indicated, we'll be prepared to respond. Our anticipated spending levels in the North Sea and Egypt remain unchanged. As we noted in this morning's press release, we're reducing our full-year international capital budget by $150 million as a result of the pending sale of our remaining oil and gas assets in Australia. Accordingly, our revised guidance for international and Gulf of Mexico capital spending is between $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion. On the cost side, both LOE and G&A are experiencing downward pressure in 2015. These operating expenses came in at just under $10 per BOE during the first quarter, which is 5% lower than 2014 actuals. For G&A, as John indicated, with the reduction in the scale of the portfolio and reduced activities around the globe, overhead costs should be coming down and they are being specifically targeted for reductions. Some of this has already been accomplished, but there is more to do. Following the closing of our Australian sales, we will prevent present a more in-depth view of our cost-cutting efforts, especially in the area of G&A spend. Interest expense for the year is projected to be around $460 million. Approximately 50% to 60% of this will be capitalized. On the tax side, we anticipate our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in 2015 will be between 25% and 30%. Note that this does not include the one-off benefit in deferred taxes for the recently enacted UK tax rate change, which we expect to be a little over $600 million. Operationally, you'll see on page two of the first quarter earnings supplement, our North America onshore production guidance is unchanged and is expected to be relatively flat compared to 2014. You'll also see in the earnings supplement that we have updated our pro forma production guidance for the Gulf of Mexico and international operations to be slightly up from 2014. Please note this guidance now excludes Australia production volumes entirely. I'd like to close by echoing what John said in his remarks. Our goal for the remainder of 2015 is to maintain a strong balance sheet, to live within our cash flow, and to prepare the organization for an efficient ramp up in activity, when the cash flows dictate. We will also continue to be opportunistic, but highly disciplined in evaluating new opportunities that may unfold in this challenging price environment. I am very excited to be a part of the Apache team, and I look forward to meeting with many of you down the road. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A.
Operator: We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. The first question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America – Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. John, I wonder if I could take the activity step-up question, if I may, and it's not so much about – you've laid out what oil price, I think, you would start to go back to work, but you still have a fairly intricate portfolio. You've got a lot of opportunities. How would you think about the incremental allocation of capital? For example, you're running more rigs in the Eagle Ford right now, but if you did go back to work, what would be the first call on spending? And I've got a follow-up on the international, please.
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Well, Doug, thank you. We have actually worked hard to be in this position to get our activity levels adjusted and obviously address the cost structure. So, it puts us in the position now where we can be opportunistic. Obviously, prices on the strip right are now running ahead of where we planned, so it puts us in a position to make some choices. The first and easiest thing, obviously, to do would be to put a couple of frack crews in and recomplete some of our drilled but uncompleted wells, but we want to be very prudent, we want to be opportunistic, we're starting to see some acreage things that pop up that might be very additive to long-term shareholder value, so, Doug, we want to be very prudent, because we worked hard to get into this position, and want to kind of monitor that as the second half of the year unfolds. We're working through a detailed planning process right now, as Steve lined out, with three price scenarios, and one at $50 flat on the low side, the other one at $80 bracketed, and then the strip, and so that will help us give some guidance in terms of those directions. Clearly, when I look at the portfolio, the Delaware Basin is an area, and the Permian is an area that we can go in quickly with cash flow in terms of additional activity as we plan to run quite a few more rigs there. And then also both the Canyon Lime and the Eagle Ford at higher prices, we'd scale in there. But, we've got lots of opportunity in front of us, and we want to be opportunistic and very careful on where we go forward.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America – Merrill Lynch: Just to qualify, John, is the backlog concentrated in one particular area? Or is it pretty much spread around?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: It's spread around. The lion's share that we mentioned, we came into the year with 207, and 80% of it was horizontal. We will work off the vertical backlog, which was predominantly in the Permian, by year-end. And we said, we'd come in – exit right now, our plan would be to exit the year with between 80 and the 100 uncompleted wells. A big chunk of those will remain in the Permian, and obviously we've got some in the Eagle Ford and then the other areas.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America – Merrill Lynch: Okay. My follow-up, John, is on the North Sea. Obviously, you had some interruptions this quarter, but in the absence of exploration success, what is the production prognosis for the North Sea? And maybe if you could just frame into that how you see your backlog of opportunities to hold production flat? I'll leave it there. Thank you.
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we're very excited about what we've been able to accomplish in the North Sea. We're coming off of a Q4 record high for us of over 80,000 BOEs a day. We've got a deep inventory there. As part of our capital reductions, we did scale back in the North Sea as well. We've got over 200 identified prospects and locations. We've got deep inventory. And for the year, Doug, from where we are right now, we would envision it being relatively flat on a go-forward basis.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America – Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll leave it there, John.
Operator: The next question will come from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, John. I guess afternoon. What's changed as far as the Delaware? Can you just give a little more detail what you're seeing, why you're getting more aggressive there, and why is the remainder of the Permian program going to be focused there?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we'll be focused in two areas. Obviously, the Delaware, even if you go back to our November update, we're planning to run four to five rigs there. That's where we were maintained today, and honestly, right now the economics there are just slightly higher. We've also got some testing we're doing there, which we think can be differential. Right now, we've only brought on two wells this year. We plan to drill another, or actually complete another 28 wells for the rest of the year. So, we're excited about our position there, and we see lots of opportunity. But, we will also be active in the Midland Basin as well as our Central Basin Platform. About half of our Permian rigs will be in the Delaware and the other half are going to be spread out. But, we're moving into the Midland County, Southern Midland Basin area, our Wildfire area, Powell, Miller. We're excited about those. We'll actually be doing a Spraberry test later this year in the Wildfire area, and we've also been drilling great wells on the Central Basin Platform. So, it's just part of our portfolio, and right now the economics over there are slightly better than they'd be in the other areas. But, we're excited about all the areas.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And just as a follow-up, if I think about the Delaware, it looks like the couple of wells that you highlighted during the quarter in the supplement were in the third Bone spring. Can you give us any color as to where you plan to focus – those four rigs? Is there any zone in particular standing out? Can give us any color on that?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, it really depends on the area. If you look at our Pecos Bend area, where the two Condor wells are, we drilled 31 wells to-date. 21 of those have been in the third Bone springs. We've had six in the Wolfcamp and four in the second Bone springs. Right now, we're kind of dialed in on the third Bone springs, and there's a couple landing zones in there. You move into the other areas, and that's the nice thing about the Delaware is you've got multiple targets, anywhere from the Avalon to the first, second, or third Bone springs or down to the Wolfcamp and some other zones. So, the nice thing is it kind of depends on the area you're in, but with where those rigs are focused.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right. Thanks.
Operator: The next question will come from Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey. You guys came out in your prepared comments and talked about having a position at 50,000 acres, kind of in the Woodford Springer area. I'm just trying to get a sense if this was a legacy position in the portfolio or something that you guys leased recently. And maybe if you can just provide a little bit more color regarding your comments about some leasing opportunities that have been picking up here?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I'll start out with the Woodford. It is predominantly legacy acreage. Last year, we did sprinkle in some sections around there. And we have been blocking that up as we have been most of our key core areas. Currently we've got one well, the Ellis 14-4-6 number 1Hs, it's right now on completion. We've got two rigs out there and we're drilling two wells, the Ellis 14 number 2H and the Truman well. So we've got three wells we'll be bringing on in the very near future. We're very excited about the rates. We've got about 200,000 acres there gross and about 50,000 net, and it's a nice little position that can be very material for us. In general, obviously, we're seeing some opportunities in all of our core areas. And that where we're busy trying to core up acreage, prep things, and be prepared for when we allocate more capital to some of the high-value areas.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: All right. And I guess you guys obviously spoke about some really nice cost reductions here that you've seen here recently on your wells. And a lot of that was focused in the Permian with some of the costs coming down. I wanted to get a sense if you guys are also not only seeing cost reductions, but are you seeing improvements in the wells, just better efficiency as you guys tweak frac design, and you're seeing the wells in the Permian get better here of late. Maybe you can speak to that?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I mean, the first thing is we did a very detailed dive on the EURs in the plays in November. And since that time, we've brought on some wells, but not many. You look at the Delaware, we brought on two wells. They are outperforming our type curve, so we're doing some things there technically which we think can improve those. But with two wells on, they've only been on 60 days, I'm not in a position right now to be updating type curves. And the same is pretty much true in our other areas. Our Canyon Lime wells are coming on relative to type curves. In the Eagle Ford, we've got some slightly above, some under. So, we feel really good about those areas. We are seeing cost, we've kind of dialed in 10% to 15% on the last call when we talked about the plan for 2015. Clearly, we said that they're going to range from 20% to 40% right now. We're seeing on average about 25%. A lot of that's attributable to the service side. But, a lot of it's just more people now focused on ways to drive cost out and doing a better job planning our wells. And clearly, if prices remain where they are, we're going to see costs further align and come down for the rest of 2015.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: I guess, previously you folks had spoken in the past, predominantly last year, about separating North American business from the rest of the international properties. I just wanted to see, if there's any kind of status update on that or if you've got kind of a new way of thinking about any type of separation of the business lines.
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we addressed that on the first quarter call. But the key objectives with us on our international portfolio were two. One, unload our LNG, which we have done, signed, closed. And then we announced the sale of Australia. I think that leaves us with a portfolio now that we plan to stick with, we're excited to have. We're 60% to 70% North America. If you look at our North Sea and our Egypt operations, we've got world-class people there as well as leading positions. And the nice thing about both the international assets, they complement our North American portfolio, they're Brent pricing. And the other thing is the way the PSCs and the tax regimes work, you've actually got less sensitivity to lower oil prices in terms of after tax cash flow. So, going forward, we're going to, as we work through our planning process, we're working through North America, we're also working through Egypt and the North Sea, and we will be outlining longer-term plans. But, we're very happy with the portfolio as it stands today.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will come from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.
Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Question on that impairment, the $4.7 billion. Can you give some detail what assets were involved there?
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, Bob. So, the primary assets that were involved there were the U.S., Canada and the North Sea. There was about a $7.2 billion gross impairment. You'll see in the 10-Q, it'll be released later today, that $5.2 billion of that was in the U.S., $1.4 billion of that was in Canada, and about $600 million of that was in the North Sea. All of that's on a pre-tax basis.
Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And the U.S. assets how would those split?
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, we're not providing a breakdown of that into the U.S.
Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then a follow-up, on the net proceeds, what's the ultimate use of those net proceeds that you've collected from Australia?
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, we collected $3.7 billion pre-tax proceeds. We've got about a $600 million tax liability that will get paid later this year, so the $3.1 billion net, $2.6 billion of that went in the month of April to pay down the debt, the short-term debt that existed on the balance sheet at the end of 1Q. The $2.1 billion that will be coming in sometime right around midyear for the second Australia transaction, that $2.1 billion will be used as a combination of debt pay down and some cash retention. We haven't decided exactly the ratio of that yet, but I would say the majority of that will be going to debt pay down.
Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Arun Jayaram from Credit Suisse.
Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good afternoon, John and Steve. My first question regards the new planning process that's under way. I think you articulated maybe three different pricing scenarios that you would look at. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of when this planning process is completed, what will be – will there be a new set of targets that you'll communicate to the Street, and could this potentially impact your views on 2015 production and capital?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Arun, at this point we're working through that. Obviously, we've got early looks, but we're taking a really deep dive at the portfolio and one of the keys is, it's an iterative process as you have to try to really synchronize cost with price environment for each of those. So, what we're really trying to do is put some sidebars on the world we'll be operating in as we start to take a longer-term view. I don't envision anything impacting 2015 from where we sit today for how we budgeted it. And so, we feel good about where we are, but we'll be working through that, and over the next several months we'll get to where we have an internal view as we start to think about how we react going into 2016.
Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Great. Obviously, John, the balance sheet is in a different place, or will be once you complete the transactions. You commented in the press release about potentially being opportunistic yet disciplined. Historically, Apache has been a counter-cyclical investor, so where is your head at in thinking about potential acquisitions, and would you be focused in on your core area, or look for new areas?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, Arun, where my head is right now is delivering value for the shareholders and trying to maximize that. And I think we have positioned ourselves very nicely. The nice thing is we have high-quality assets and deep inventory, but we also are always opportunistic and always in looking at opportunities, so if there was something that we thought made sense and incrementally might add value, then we might be willing to move forward on it. But, in general, we're happy with our asset base and we're going to be very selective, but clearly we're in a position where we have a lot of flexibility, and you'd never know what might present itself.
Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Just my final question, as you think about capital allocation to the Permian this year, could you give us a sense of what percentage of your CapEx, perhaps ballpark, is going for Midland versus Delaware and how that could shift over time given your comments on the Delaware today?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I mean, when we look at where we sit right now, kind of like even like what we lined out in November, about 60% of our CapEx on North America is in the Permian. When you look at what we've done with the price environment, we've slowed down much more so than we had planned in the Eagle Ford and the Canyon Lime, and even Canada. So, for the bulk of the year, the majority of our capital is going to be going into the Permian. I would say that in terms of, if we were to add incrementally, the Southern Midland Basin would be an area we've got the best – most flexibility and things ready to drill that we could move quicker on. We had kind of planned even in higher capital and prices to run the number of rigs we're running in the Delaware. So, we like our pace right there given our asset base, so I would say incrementally we'd probably add first in the Delaware or we might choose to accelerate in the Delaware or add in the Midland Basin.
Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks a lot, John.
Operator: The next question will come from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, John, and to the rest of your team there. If I could ask a question about those Wildfire wells that you just mentioned in your operations report. Presumably, if you were ready to share already you would have put it in there. But, you did I believe say that the early flow back was very favorable on those four wells, so I wonder if you could perhaps condition us a bit on – give us a background on, did you batch drill and batch complete those four wells? Did they just come on in the last week or so, and what is it? Is it the total fluid volume that's being moved that has you feeling it's favorable?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, Charles, what I'll say is, I'll go ahead and give a little bit of color. We've got four, roughly 7,500 foot Wolfcamp B wells that are in what we call the Lynch Unit. All four wells were completed in late March. We've got all of them on in less than three weeks, so we're not ready to talk about 30-day rates, they're going to be second quarter wells. But they've been encouraging. In general, we've had an average kind of peak IP of around 1,400 BOEs a day, they're 70% to 80% oil. So, we're very excited about them, and we're flowing them back very conservatively. So, we're very, very encouraged. Additionally, we've got about three wells there, we'll drill in 2015 and delineate and optimize and test our fracs, and then it sets us up for quite a drilling program there going forward when we decided to scale up. We also plan to test a Spraberry shale well there, probably in the third or fourth quarter of this year.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it. Got it. That's great additional detail, John. And then, if I could ask another question. This goes back to the drilled uncompleted count that you expect to have at year-end 2015. I think you said it was 80 to 100. Perhaps you could tell me, if I'm thinking about this the right way, but if you're running 15 rigs, and just to make the math easy, let's say, your average drill time or drill and complete time is – I guess spud to rig release would be the appropriate thing, is 30-days, that would imply kind of a six-month backlog there. And if you cut it in half and say, okay, well our spud to rig release is 15 days, it gets down to about a three-month backlog. So, both of those seem sort of high to me, and it makes me wonder if you plan to continue to work down that backlog as you go into 2016, and could you tell me, is that the right way to look at that?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, what I'll say is, what it tells you is we're going to carry. We're not just aggressively moving through our backlog. And that's a function of cash flow and being very disciplined. Clearly, we could go complete a lot of wells today, if we wanted to. We're going to take a very measured approach. We're being very careful with how we allocate our capital and how we handle it this year, but it puts us in a position where we will enter 2016 with a lot of flexibility, just like we entered 2015.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Got it. That's what I was after. Thanks a lot, John.
Operator: The next question will come from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.
Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. I was just wondering, you've talked about cost improvement and performance improvement. Around these oil prices, with this level of spending, where would you anticipate your volumes to be growing or not growing in 2016? And is there a price of oil that you can share with us, where you feel that if we saw that price, you would start to reaccelerate the activity? Thanks.
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, good questions, Paul. What I'd say is, number one, it's cash flow for us that matters. I don't worry as much about oil price. What I'll say is, we're taking a very hard look right now and going through a very rigorous planning process, which kind of brackets some scenarios. And we're looking at a range, which we would mirror – kind of mirror the cost structure to those oil prices and look at that. So, as we get further into the year, into the next quarter, and we get closer to 2016 and things crystallize, we'll start to be more candid on where we are for 2016.
Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Right. So, I was just wondering if we could get a sense, given the way performance is improving, let's say for example, you held your CapEx at these levels, how would you anticipate your performance in volumes to be next year?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: What I'll say is, clearly, if we're in a low price environment, capital in 2016's going to go further than it went in 2015, because costs are going to be lower, we're seeing efficiencies. Additionally, with the G&A reductions and things we're targeting, we will be able to put more dollars in. So, through the efficiencies and that sort of thing, it's going to take less in 2016 to deliver than we have in 2015, but beyond that, we're working through a rigorous process, we're going to stay committed to bracketing kind of the environment we're in and then communicating that at a later date.
Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Understood. I can kind of sense that you're in the process, so it's hard to talk about, but I'll just try one more. Could you just put some numbers around the cost savings that you've achieved, and maybe where you think we may be by the end of the year? And I'll leave it there, thanks.
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we outlined in February a 15% reductions from our November levels on our well-by-well basis. If you look at it today, I've said today we'd be at least 25%. So, the one thing is we came into the 2015 hot. We spent a lot of our capital, so if you look at our go-forward capital for 2015, we're seeing down 25% on average from the levels that we had in November 20.
Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. And you think there's more to come?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Absolutely.
Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: All right. Thanks.
Operator: The next question will come from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Co.
Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Co. International: Yeah. Good afternoon, John. Thank you for taking my questions. John, just following up on Paul's question there, just to clarify, so if you were to hold CapEx flat in 2016 versus 2015, in North America, do you think you'd be able to grow production?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Pearce, we're early. I don't want to give you overall numbers, because we're working through planning. I'm just – my point was, if I hold CapEx flat, I'm going to get more out of it in 2016 than I got out of it in 2015.
Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Co. International: Okay. Great. And then on Egypt, it seems like the political environment has become more stable. You had some – the permits that you got on the concessions were faster, it looked like, this most recent round. Is the arrow pointed up in Egypt? And if so, could you end up allocating more capital there?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I think clearly the investment area there is improving, and if you go back, even though the Arab Spring, we've never skipped a beat. So, it's in general, the investment has always been good for us. We've got a great relationship with the Egyptian government, and we did set record times and bring in Ptah and Berenice on, but we've been that way in the past. So, lot of advantages. It's, clearly the sentiment is turning, and like the rest of our business we're excited about it, and that's one of the options we'll have on the table as we start to think about if we have incremental cash flow, where would we put it.
Operator: The next question will come from James Sullivan with Alembic Global Advisors.
James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Hey, good afternoon, folks. I just want to go back for a second to the Condor wells in the Delaware. Just want to see – the 30-day IP you gave of those was not, is not normalized for lateral and the short lateral length, is that right?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: That is correct.
James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Okay. Great. So, that's a good number. Just to follow-up on that, your position out in the Delaware seems to consist more of the smaller lease configurations. What is the appetite? You guys have talked about bolt-ons and leasehold. What's your appetite or can you describe the environment for trying to block up your acreage? Obviously, I'm sure there's always appetite to do it, but with firming up in prices are the bid asks just too tough, and would you migrate over the river into Reeves to try to do that, and where you might get a better pricing?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I mean, I think we're obviously very high in the Delaware. We've got lots of room to build off of, and we've got inventory for many years on our existing acreage position. It's one of the areas that clearly that if we felt like we could add something at attractive prices that we'd look at.
James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Okay. Sounds good. Just to go to the international piece. Obviously, since you guys are thinking about the North Sea and Egypt as a retained part of the portfolio, could you just remind me, this is probably something I should know, but could you just tell me what the challenges are associated with the cycling that free cash flow back to the U.S. under kind of a normal retained asset accounting? I know that those should be free cash flowing generally, if you think about a normalized price environment, so the idea that feeding the U.S. will be a positive thing, but just want to see what the tax implications would be of that?
Stephen J. Riney - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, James. We don't see any significant issues with cycling cash back to the U.S. now, especially with eliminating the election to permanently reinvest earnings overseas, and we'll be able to do that with a significant amount of foreign tax credits as well going forward.
Operator: The next question will come from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.
Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Howdy?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Jim.
Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Hi, John, I wanted to ask you first a broad question, and then a specific one. You mentioned a couple of times on the call today that $65 a barrel was an encouraging number, let's say. I'm just wondering, do we mean that you're looking at it as something that you have an ability to hedge at $65, or do you have a certain amount of time you want to see stability around $65 a barrel, before you begin to start pulling levers?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: What I would say is right now, we're not hedged. Our best hedge is our activity levels, which we are able to mirror. Clearly, we would look at – hedging is a tool that we could use before we started to make some longer-term commitments in terms of activity levels as we went into these plays. The point is, for the Canyon Lime and the Eagle Ford, when you get into the $60 to $65 range, that's an area where they become very attractive for us to put capital back to work. But as I said in my prepared notes, they'd have to compete with the other opportunity set.
Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Right. And the other question I wanted to ask was about the Eagle Ford itself. I think you gave a little bit more color, or at least maybe I noticed it this time, a little more color and complexity in the play. Now you've got a lot of 3D seismic covers. And I also remember last quarter, you said sometimes it's not such a bad thing to be forced to slow down a little bit. And I'm wondering if the path forward here for a little while is to use this 3D, to try to figure out the better places to not only – better ways to complete your wells, but maybe even thinking about better places to drill preparatory to the time when you return rigs there?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, actually, would you look at the Eagle Ford, we're dealing with four phases across our acreage position. We've got black oil, we've got volatile oil, we've got wet gas, and we've got obviously dry gas, which we're not obviously focused on. As you look across those three areas, you've got 38 wells to complete, Jeff, 17 in Area A, as we lined out back in November and 21 in Area B. We've been focused on our cost side. I think we have made significant progress on the drilling side. So, it's just optimizing completions and working on improving the economics. So, we'll be working on that and providing updates later in the year.
Operator: The final question will come from Michael Rowe with Tudor, Pickering.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thanks for squeezing me in here. I just had one quick question on the Permian. Can you talk a little bit more about the growth in oil volumes for the rest of the year, while gas stays flat? Is that a function of the weather impact reversing itself here, or is it that you're leading on your completion backlog? How should we think about the growth there in oil, with the reduced capital spending?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, there's two things. Number one, obviously, from where we are first quarter, we did have weather impacts. So, there's a piece of that. The other thing is, though, we only brought on two Delaware Basin wells. So, we've got pretty good inventory ahead of us. In fact, if you go back to our Q4, we did not bring on a lot. So, we're sitting with some nice things coming on and as you get into the second quarter and into the summer months, we've got some key pads and some things we'll be bringing on which are going to help drive the liquids in the Permian coming forward. So, we've just got a lot of our stuff in front of us. We've moved into the Southern Midland Basin Wolfcamp, so we've got a lot of exciting things to bring on, even at the reduced activity levels in the Permian. And then I can't underscore our base decline. We've got 25%, 26% across North America, and a nice thing about us relative to our peers is having a big Central Basin Platform position where our decline rates and the water floods, we've got 45 water floods, we've got seven CO2 floods, having a lot of that low decline base really helps in terms of our volumes out there.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: That's helpful. Appreciate the detail there, and then one quick question on the North Sea. Was curious about the 3D seismic survey that you're doing there at the Beryl field, because you're working on some drilling plans. And subject to more capital availability, you would maybe consider drilling some more wells there. Does that savings of $150 million from selling Australia, does that kind of give you the capital availability to potentially put a few more North Sea wells in the 2015 program, or is that more planning for 2016 drilling?
John J. Christmann - President and Chief Executive Officer: I would say we've got a plan right now. We've got brand-new 3D there which we're excited about. The 150 comes out of Australia reductions. So clearly, anything we decide to add anywhere is going to be a function of future generation off our existing base. But, there is opportunity in the North Sea. We've got some exciting things we will be testing later this year and well into 2016 and beyond. So, it gets back to the depth and the opportunity to generate value over the long haul. The thing I would add about the North Sea that's differential for us is in both of our big complexes, we have made significant investments in our infrastructure that pushes our abandonment timeframe way out into the 2030 range. And we've spent over $1 billion at Forties, which gives us long, long runway there. And the same thing at Beryls, we've spent $300 million there over the last few years, which gives us lots of runway in time, and we're very excited about the opportunity set.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Kelly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the 2014 Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.
Gary T. Clark: Great. Thank you, Kelly. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporations fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Speakers making prepared remarks on today’s call will be Apache CEO and President, John Christmann; and Interim CFO, Anthony Lannie. Also joining us in the room are Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President and COO of International and Steve Riney, who will officially take over as Apache's new CFO later this month. We are delighted to have Steve on Board and look forward to hearing from him on next quarter’s conference call. In conjunction with this morning’s press release I hope you've had the opportunity to review our quarterly earnings supplement which summarizes our operational activities and well highlights across various Apache operating regions. The supplement also includes information on our capital expenditures for the quarter, as well as a chart that illustrates cash sources and uses and reconciles Apache's change in net debt during 2014. Our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations and our quarterly earnings supplement can all be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com. I'd like to remind everybody that today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. This morning we reported a fourth quarter 2014 loss of $4.8 billion or $12.78 per diluted share. These results contain several non-cash charges primarily related to the impact of declining oil and gas prices, acreage impairments, the announced disposition of our LNG assets and changes in foreign tax estimates and assumptions. Adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results totaled $404 million or $1.07 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital totaled $2.1 billion during the quarter. Worldwide reported net production averaged 673,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with liquids production constituting 62% of that total. On a pro forma basis, which excludes assets that have been divested, non-controlling interests, and tax barrels in Egypt, our fourth quarter worldwide production was 609,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This represents an 8% increase from the third quarter and a 12% increase from the same period a year ago. I would now like to turn the call over to John Christmann.
John J. Christmann: Thank you, Gary. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I would like to start by saying a few words about our long-time Chairman, CEO and President, Steve Farris. Steve announced last month that he would be retiring from Apache following more than two decades of leadership. During his tenure he helped grow the Company to one of the largest and most successful independents in the world. I would like to personally thank Steve for his service and am honored to be his successor as the new CEO and President of Apache. In 2010, Steve initiated a strategic repositioning to bring Apache's primary focus back to North America. As we showed you at our November North American update, 2014 was a milestone year for this transformation. We streamlined and enhanced our North American portfolio and we added significant new unconventional capabilities. We now have a deeper and more predictable inventory of economic locations in North America than at any time in Apache's history. Our drilling production and inventory is oil prone and located in areas with multiple stack pay horizons, which we believe creates a significant long-term competitive advantage. We have the right teams, processes, and science in place to efficiently develop our existing Resource and to build future opportunities. In response to the rapid drop in oil price, we have purposely taken quick and decisive action to reduce our drilling activity, well costs, G&A and lease operating expenses. This will position us more favorably and make us a more efficient Operator in the future. A top strategic priority for Apache during 2014 was to sell our Wheatstone and Kitimat LNG assets. I am pleased to note that the sale of these assets, which we announced in December is on track to close by the end of the first quarter. Including capital cost reimbursement, estimated proceeds from this transaction will be approximately $3.7 billion, which we will use initially to pay down debt. Our operations in Egypt and the North Sea provide a very nice complement to our North American production and cash flow. Cash flow from Egypt and the North Sea has less than 50% of the downside sensitivity to oil prices as our North American operations. Importantly, both regions are still expected to generate free cash flow in 2015 at current strip pricing. Apache’s Egypt and North Sea operations offer steady, high rate of return projects, and the portfolio diversification benefits of these regions becomes evident during oil price downturns like the one we are currently experiencing. While we always leave open the option to adjust any part of our portfolio in response to changing conditions, we are not currently proceeding with a sale or spinoff of Egypt or the North Sea. With regard to Australia, we are taking a close look at the potential monetization of our remaining non-LNG assets. The value of these assets is generally underpinned by long-term fixed price natural gas contracts, which we believe increases the universe of buyers and the potential valuation, even in this depressed oil price environment. In summary, our portfolio is well positioned to weather the low oil price storm and I'm excited to have the opportunity set that lies before us today. Before we go to the fourth quarter results and outlook for 2015, I'll make a few comments about oil prices and the actions we have taken thus far in this fast moving price environment. We cannot predict nor control the length or depth of this oil price correction, or the timing and extent of the rebound. We have therefore acted quickly and decisively regarding the things we can control. Our activity levels and cost structure. During the third quarter of 2014, we operated 91 rigs onshore in North America. By the end of this month, we will have reduced our rig count to 27. On the pressure pumping side our frac crews are down more than 50% over the same time frame. In some instances we are choosing to lay down rigs that were under longer-term contract at day rates reflective of $100 oil price environment. As a result, we expect to pay some modest early termination penalties totaling approximately $50 million. We are also delaying the completion of some wells in backlog until pressure pumping costs reset to levels that better reflect the current commodity price environment. Corporate cash flow is the main constraint on our 2015 drilling plans. We would consider using our balance sheet only to capitalize on lower acreage costs and other potential opportunities that may occur, rather than to drill wells and chase production in a depressed and volatile oil price environment. Importantly, once we achieve the full benefit of lower well costs, our returns will be competitive at $50 per barrel of oil to those represented in our November North American update at $80 per barrel. The key difference is that we will simply have less cash flow to work with and will accordingly drill fewer wells. Additionally, we are diligently working through a dynamic scenario planning process that will allow us to quickly adapt our business and activity levels under a variety of potential commodity price case scenarios. During the robust and relatively stable oil price environment over the last four years Apache was one of the most active drillers in North America. We grew our Permian Basin production by more total barrels at a faster rate than any of our peers. I’m highly confident that when oil prices begin to recover and stabilize at higher levels we will efficiently ramp up our drilling programs in the Permian, Eagle Ford and Canyon Lime to deliver top-tier production and cash flow growth. The recent oil price decline has been dramatic and almost unprecedented, but we believe that it will create a once in a decade opportunity for those of us that have moved aggressively. For Apache the oil price drop and subsequent industry slowdown has several positive aspects that we believe enhanced our ability to generate strong long-term shareholder returns. The slowdown provides an opportunity for us to be come a more efficient company through focused initiatives such as realigning our North American incentive program to reward continuous improvement and cost discipline, creating medium and longer term field development plans and high grading and improving our drilling inventory, rationalizing and consolidating our acreage position, leveraging our surface operations infrastructure and scale, adding key acreage while there is less competition and at lower prices, and reducing our North American base production decline. Regardless of how long oil prices remain depressed we plan to emerge in this downturn as a top-tier resource company in terms of drilling inventory, operational efficiency, cost structure and balance sheet strength. Now let's talk about Apache’s full-year 2014 results. Worldwide production on a pro forma basis grew 6.5% in 2014 which was right in the middle of our 5% to 8% guidance range. Absent some timing delays on the startup of our two large offshore Australian oil projects worldwide production would have been at the high end of our guidance range for 2014. Onshore North American liquids production grew 18.6%which exceeded the high end of our 15% to 18% guidance range provided back in February of 2014. This strong performance was possible, because our high quality extensive drilling inventory in the Permian region enabled us to accelerate activity levels and production while at the same time we were seeing slower than expected growth and were recalibrating our capital program in the central region. As a result North American liquids growth was driven by the Permian where production increased 25% from the prior year or approximately double the midpoint of the guidance we provided back in February. In the central region growth was essentially flat for the year, but despite a difficult first half played by weather and operational problems we were able to reduce our drilling programs significantly in the second half of the year while maintaining steady to slightly increasing production. The North Sea and Egypt were ahead of plan, while Australia was a little behind plan due to timing delays Balnaves and Coniston oil projects. It was a good year for us internationally and we generated very strong free cash flow ex LNG spending. Turning to our 2015 capital budget and production outlook, based on the midpoint of our capital guidance range we anticipate spending a total of $3.8 billion in 2015, which excludes potential lease hold purchases or acquisitions. Compared to 2014, this represents a 60% decrease in our capital spending. We expect our pro forma onshore North American production to be roughly flat and our pro forma international and offshore production to be slightly up in 2015. Our Companywide 2015 pro forma production should be relatively unchanged from 2014. We believe this is a pretty good outcome given the extent we are reducing the capital program. Turning to the fourth quarter regional review and our planned activity levels for 2015. I was very pleased our drilling results across the entire company. We had success in every region during the fourth quarter. Onshore North America delivered liquids production growth of 5% sequentially and 20% year-over-year when adjusted for asset divestitures. The Permian was once again our biggest growth driver and we exited the year with record production. We ran 42 rigs during the fourth quarter and we expect to have this down approximately 15 by the end of the month. In 2015, we plan to average 10 to 12 rigs in the Permian approximately five of which will be in the Midland Basin, four in the Delaware Basin, and two rigs will be drilling high rate of return vertical and horizontal wells on the Central Basin platform in Northwest Shelf. In the Central Region net production grew 3% sequentially during the quarter as we completed 72 gross wells in various legacy Anadarko Basin formations. You can see the results from some of these wells in our quarterly supplement where we highlight a few key contributors from the Granite Wash, Cottage Grove and Cleveland and Lower Marmaton. As a result of taking a more measured approach in these legacy plays, we are seeing better-than-average well performance, better returns, and much better capital efficiency. During most of 2015, we plan to keep one rig running in the Anadarko Basin. In the Canyon Lime, no new wells were brought online during the fourth quarter; however we just started to flow back our first four well pad in the Canyon Lime and will have some flow rates to report there in the near future. In the Eagle Ford, our rig count peaked at 12 in December and by end of this month will be down to four. By mid-year we plan to have one to two rigs working in the Eagle Ford and are prepared to ramp back up quickly if oil prices allow. The Eagle Ford is an excellent example of our cost initiatives driving positive returns in this depressed price environment. Our initial wells in Area B of the play were running in excess of $8 million. If you'll recall back in our November North American update, we projected 2015 well costs would average around $7 million. With lower service costs and further design improvements, we think we'll have these wells down closer to $6 million within a few months, which depending on their oil cut, they can deliver solid economics and strip prices. In Area A, where we should generally have better economics, we have a backlog of 20 or so wells that we will be bringing on over the course of the year. Apache is progressing its understanding of the Eagle Ford petroleum system and will update you later this year as we gather more data. We plan to continue consolidating acreage around our core position. To sum it up, we're drilling better wells at lower cost and continue to expand our understanding of this compelling play. In Canada, we are finishing up a three-rig drilling program in the Duverney and Montney plays this spring and will release the rigs for the remainder of the year. We plan to complete a seven-well pad in the Duverney in the third quarter and in the Montney we continue to develop a long term solution to process future Montney gas production. We are making progress reducing drilling and completion costs in Canada. Canadian production averaged 72,300 BOEs a day during the fourth quarter, which is a decrease of 1% sequentially from the third quarter. Given minimal planned activity during 2015, we anticipate that production will decline from fourth quarter levels. Turning to our international operations, all three of our regions, the North Sea, Egypt and Australia, delivered profitable production growth and remain on track to generate significant free cash flow for the year. In Egypt, we made two oil discoveries during the quarter. While additional appraisal work is under way, the Ptah and Berenice field discoveries appear to be two of Apache's largest oil field discoveries in Egypt over the last 15 years. On a gross basis we expect Egypt will decline modestly in 2015, but our cost recovery mechanism there will result in a fairly significant increase in our net barrels. In the North Sea we delivered the strongest production numbers in the history of the region with a great rebound from the third quarter turnaround season. Coming off this high watermark and given the significant reduction in capital investments, we are starting to see natural declines kick in. With the program we have planned we do expect North see will decline slightly in 2015 beginning in the first quarter. Lastly in Australia, we continue to make progress towards first oil at Coniston, which is expected to be online mid year. I would now like to turn the call over to our interim CFO, Anthony Lannie, who will discuss in further detail our fourth-quarter non-cash earnings charges and provide guidance around first quarter 2015 North American production and CapEx.
P. Anthony Lannie: Thank you, John, and good afternoon. I would like to begin by providing some detail around our fourth quarter non-cash charges. As noted in this morning's press release, we reported an after-tax loss of $4.8 billion or $12.78 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of several key non-recurring items. We incurred $2 billion in after-tax non- cash property write-downs related to full-cost ceiling impairments in the U.S. and North Sea. Under full-cost accounting we are required to use trailing 12 month oil prices to calculate the PV-10 value of our reserves each quarter. Approximately half of the charges associated with the Company's full-cost ceiling test were driven by an impairment of acreage that we do not intend to drill. We recorded a $1.3 billion impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter related to our U.S., North Sea and Canada reporting units. This is a function of prior-year acquisition values being valued under today's lower commodity price deck. If oil prices do not recover materially from the current futures market price indication, the Company expects further impairments of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties throughout the remainder of 2015. The Company does not, however anticipate significant additional acreage or goodwill impairments in 2015. In December 2014, we announced the sale of Apache's interest in the Kitimat and Wheatstone LNG projects along with associated upstream oil and gas assets, to Woodside Petroleum for $2.75 billion plus recovery of Apache's net expenditures made between June 30, 2014 and closing. Assets associated with the sale of our LNG facilities are classified as held-for-sale on the balance sheet. Accounting rules require us to evaluate assets held-for-sale for impairment. Accordingly an impairment analysis was performed on these assets and an after-tax loss of $753 million was recognized in earnings. The full-cost upstream assets associated with this sale are excluded from held-for-sale accounting and no impairment was recorded, however. We do expect a non-cash charge upon closing of the sale. Lastly, we incurred approximately $1 billion in non-cash deferred tax adjustments for the fourth quarter, primarily related to the U.S. GAAP rules pertaining to the measurement of income taxes on undistributed earnings in our international regions that we no longer consider to be permanently reinvested. The announced sale of our interest in the Kitimat and Wheatstone LNG projects and associated upstream assets was a key step in refocusing our portfolio and giving us more flexibility with capital allocation. Additionally, during 2014 we completed the sale of our Argentina region, our deepwater Gulf of Mexico interest and several non-core assets across North America. In total for the year, we completed or announced sales of approximately $7 billion of assets worldwide, we intend to use the proceeds of the remaining sales to pay down debt and strengthen our balance sheet in this low price environment. I would like to leave you with some guidance for our North American onshore operations in the 2015 first quarter. We currently project that quarter one North America onshore production will average between 300,000 and 305,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day which is down slightly from our record fourth quarter 2014 levels when adjusted for asset sales. This slight decrease is attributable to the plan deferral of completions which John spoke about earlier couple with the impact of severe weather conditions during January. In the Permian region alone we experienced abnormal weather related down time of approximately 14-days in the first half of January. The estimated impact of this down time when spread across the quarter is roughly 3700 barrels of oil per day. From a CapEx standpoint, we anticipate spending roughly $800 million in onshore North America during the first quarter which represent approximately 36% of our full year onshore North America budget. I should also note that our first quarter and full-year 2015 capital budget excludes approximately $300 million of estimated spending for LNG which we anticipate being reimbursed upon closing of the LNG sales this quarter. Our financial strategy for 2015 is to maintain a strong balance sheet and live within our cash flow in order to take advantage of opportunities quickly and efficiently once prices begin to recover. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for question-and-answers.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David R. Tameron of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
David R. Tameron: Hi, good morning. John, can you talk about – when we start thinking about the rig efficiency, obviously I know you’re going to say everything you drill is good but some has got to be better than the others. So when I start thinking about productivity per rig and those type of metrics, what type of up lift do you think you'll see on the scale back?
John J. Christmann: Well I mean it’s hard to put the percentage as an actual percentage, but clearly about slowing down on high grading, we will focus on our best wells, additionally we're going to be drilling wells, only wells that we really need to drill right now and the nice thing is a lot of our acreage is held, we don’t have lease obligations we're worried about. So it’s all about reducing the cost structure and improving the economics before we really speed up, but there is going to be efficiencies dialed in, I think that kind of goes into what the capital reduction that we've shown and where we are given guidance on the production levels.
David R. Tameron: Okay, one more for me and I'll let somebody else jump on. When I start thinking about the toggle and what you guys are looking for mid year, obviously you want service cost reductions. And you mentioned this, you alluded to this that your 2015 is more captive, your capital program is more constrained by your cash flow. What should we look for? What metrics should we be looking for on our end to try to guess when and if you decide to ramp?
John J. Christmann: Well, I mean the easy thing is we'll signal because we'll pick up rigs when we start to ramp, so but I mean there’s two things. There’s two parts that equation, one is a commodity price, but the bigger deal right now is cost structure and we made the decision to consciously and aggressively drop rigs, because the cost structure needs to come down for this price environment and we can always ramp back up, I mean you look at our depth of our portfolio in the Permian we showed we delivered 25% year-over-year growth, we got very, very deep high graded inventory. So it’s going to easy to scale up, but the big deal as we've got to drive the cost structure down to reflect this current price environment.
David R. Tameron: Okay, thank you. I'll let somebody else jump on. I appreciate it.
John J. Christmann: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond of Simmons & Company. Your line is open.
Pearce W. Hammond: Good afternoon, guys.
John J. Christmann: Hello.
Pearce W. Hammond: Hey, John, I was curious how you can reduce your North American rig count so sharply, yet keep production flat. Touching on the earlier question, is this due to greater efficiencies or well productivity? Or is it a backlog of drilled but not completed wells that you can work through this year? And then, if you stayed at an average of 17 rigs into 2016, do you think you'd keep production flat there? Or would it start to decline?
John J. Christmann: Well, I mean clearly we are able to drop quickly because we did not have a lot of committed contract or required location we had to drill. So we are able to scale back very quickly. We will come into 15 with a pretty deep backlog of wells and we have pushed a lot of those completions back, because quite honestly, we've got to get the completion cost to come in line as well. So we are going to very methodically push those back. If I can defer those, see the benefits of lower completion costs and then bring those back on and potential higher price environment and later there is a big win there. As for what 16 looks like a lot of that’s going to depend on where we are mid-year and what the program does. So we’ve got the benefit this year of having a backlog of completions and we can spread those out and it's kind of how we planned it.
Pearce W. Hammond: And then, John, I know this question I'm about to ask is tied into what the cost structure is, but at what oil price would you be willing to accelerate the drill bit again?
John J. Christmann: Right now, the wells we're drilling are economic because we've been aggressively attacking the cost structure. As I mentioned in the script, our limitation is cash flow and we're wanting to put it, our cash flow to work in the best places, we don't feel right now that tapping the balance sheet to drill wells that we don't have to drill in this price environment or cost structure makes sense, so I think we've got a deep inventory and when the economics and more cash becomes available we will ramp back up.
Pearce W. Hammond: Great, and one last quick one for me. What level of service cost concessions are you currently experiencing? And how much do you think you can capture this year on a percentage basis?
John J. Christmann: I mean I'd say in general, if you look at our Eagle Ford and I alluded to that in the script, we showed cost in our November update of around $7 million, we're early last year we were North of eight, I can tell you we’ve already reflective of old service costs, we just TD'd a well in the 6.5 range. We feel like we can get those well under six so we're already down 10% to 15%. We got now some things dialing in that's going to help our numbers go further, so with the drop in oil price being where it is I know a lot of our competitors are talking about just seeing 10% well cost reductions that's going to have to be more than that. We're seeing more than that.
Pearce W. Hammond: Thank you, very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Arun Jayaram: Good afternoon, John. I first wanted to ask you a little bit about the shape of the production profile in 2015. I guess you guided to 300,000 to 305,000 BOE. That suggests you'll stay relatively flat all year. Is that how we should think about it? Because what we don't know is how you plan to time the completions throughout the year?
John J. Christmann: Yes, Arun, with where Anthony alluded to first quarter being and where we’re going to exit where we average it's pretty good assumption on how we are got it dialed in right now. Obviously first quarter is being impacted by the significant down time we've had already. First two weeks of January were very rough in the Permian and central so that's part of why you see more of a flat look because we've had a lot of down time early but we do have a lot of completions that we'll be able to bring on and obviously drilling better wells with the rigs we’re going to be running too so I think that's probably a pretty reasonable view of how we’d look at right now.
Arun Jayaram: Okay, the only thing that wasn't quite intuitive, you guys talked about spending $800 million in Q1 which is about 36% of your budget yet you're deferring completions, could you just maybe reconcile that a little bit, the timing of the spend?
P. Anthony Lannie: Sure. It's just simply we're coming in hot, plus we've got the LNG spend too that when that closes so you've got a combination, but you don't go from running 90 rigs to down to levels we're going to be and not have a hot spend early.
Arun Jayaram: Makes sense. Just a couple other quick ones. John, you alluded to $800 million of acreage acquisition costs in Q4. Can you give us some details on where you added the acreage?
John J. Christmann: We touched on that in November. I mean it was predominantly in our key areas. A lot of that was Eagle Ford and Canyon Lime and Permian and really within our core areas.
Arun Jayaram: Okay, and then my final one is on the international. In the slides, when you do the pro forma adjustment, you talk about the Australia asset sales and North Sea. I believe Australia's Balnaves. Can you give us some numbers around the magnitude of the sales at Balnaves and in the North Sea?
John J. Christmann: Well, I let Gary answer that one, Arun.
Gary T. Clark: Arun, we can say that the Scott, Telford and the Balnaves you are going to be in the 10,000 sort of type barrel range.
Arun Jayaram: Okay, thanks a lot Gary.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett of Bernstein. Your line is open.
Bob Brackett: Hey, question on the status of the split of the international assets. Is that on ice in a low-price environment? Is that still something that's a strategic priority?
John J. Christmann: Right now in this price environment a lot changes a $100 price environment to $50, so right now as I stated in the prepared comments, we are not proceeding with anything on the spinoff of Egypt or North Sea. We are looking at possibly still monetizing or the non-LNG assets of Australia, but at this point in this price environment I think you're seeing strength of our international assets complement our North American portfolio.
Bob Brackett: And can you talk about where your hedges stand for 2015 now, and what your hedging strategy this year and next might be?
John J. Christmann: Right now, we’ve got very little hedges 415 and that is one of the things we're going to be looking at is was what type we've gone through a major transformation as we started thinking about 15 the world changed and that's something we'll be looking at early part of this year is what type of hedging strategy we would use in the future.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe from TPH. Your line is open.
Michael J. Rowe: Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could maybe provide a little bit of context around your backlog at the end of the year, of your $2.2 billion mid-point budget for North America onshore. How much of that is actually just blowing through and completing drilled but uncompleted wells versus actually going and drilling new wells to add to the production base?
John J. Christmann: Well I’ll say we haven’t provided a lot of color there, we are coming into the year with a couple of harder wells, so it is a portion of that budget, but we are going spread it out over the year.
Michael J. Rowe: Okay, that's fine. And then, switching to one specific region, the Eagle Ford, that has a pretty sharp rig count drop down to about one maybe two rigs in 2015. You mentioned getting the cost structure down to $6 million per well, so what exactly needs to happen to get there to make that asset more competitive? And if we see a rebound in crude oil prices, do you expect that cost structure to come back up? How should we think about that specific asset and the drilling economics there?
John J. Christmann: Well the answer there is when you look at our cash flow, still the lion share of our capital is going to go into our bread and butter Permian which has been driving our performance. So we're going to be down to one rig - one to two rigs in Eagle Ford, one to two rigs in the Canyon Lime, those are both areas where we are advancing deep inventory of economic wells, but in terms of how they stack out right now, the Delaware Basin and so our step in the Permian is going to little bit slightly higher, but I do not see some of the efficiencies we are driving into those well costs, a lot of those are utilizing 3D avoiding drilling hazards or efficiency, there is more to this than just service cost. So I don’t envision any of those coming back in even if prices rebound. So that’s the nice thing about slowing down is this is going to really give us a chance to when we speed back up to do it a lot more efficiently in a lot better later, because a lot of the changes are not just come out of service side, they are out of our end and designs and other efficiencies.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of RBC. Your line is open.
Leo Mariani: Hey guys, I was hoping you could speak a little bit about the improvement you saw in results in the Central Basin, particularly some of these Lower Marmaton wells looked really massive. Could you speak a little about to some of the well costs you're seeing in Central? I know it's a bit different by some of these formations and where you're going to be targeting most of the capital in 2015 there?
John J. Christmann: Well we are really going to have one rig around it, so what we’ve shown though is by taking a very measured and disciplined approach which we made a lot of operational changes you know management changes last summer in Tulsa, and you're seeing fruit of that really start to come through. It's more conventional reservoirs. We've got to do more homework up front. It shows the depth and quality of the acreage up there but really when you look at this year it will be a very small program just based on the commodity mix and so forth.
Leo Mariani: Okay, so is there any particular zone that you guys focus on? Or is it still multiple horizons in terms of how you tackle this?
John J. Christmann: It will high graded list of all wells there, so we do have a couple hundred acres in the Woodford that will be active there, about 50,000 net in the ops report, there will be lower Marmaton and then we got some nice Cottage Grove and Cleveland and big kind of small assortment of all the best projects we have from all those formations.
Leo Mariani: Okay, that's helpful. And in terms of your guidance here for the first quarter in North America, your 300,000 to 305,000 BOE, does that exclude production that you're selling as part of the LNG divestiture? Some of the Kitimat properties? Or is that included in those numbers? And are those going to be discontinued or how does that work?
John J. Christmann: There is actually with what’s being sold with Kitimat there's not any production would be dialed into those numbers. So that is an adjusted number that you would expect to see from us post sales.
Operator: Your next question come from the line of Harry Mateer of Barclays. Your line is open.
Harry Mateer: Hi, good afternoon. The first question, so you've mentioned that you plan to initially use asset sale proceeds to pay down debt. First, can you just tell us how much CP and/or credit facility borrowings you had at the end of the year? And then can you talk about how you plan to pay down the debt? Are you considering more liability management actions like you did in late 2013 to take out long term debt? Or are you just looking to take down short-term borrowings?
John J. Christmann: I'll have Anthony answer that question.
P. Anthony Lannie: Just short-term borrowing, but we had $11.2 billion of debt at the end of the year with $800,000 million of cash on the balance sheet for net debt position of 10.4. We’ve increased our CP line of credit and $3 billion to $5 billion in December. So we have about almost $4 billion of available credit line.
Harry Mateer: Okay, and then second, can you just update us on your balance sheet and credit rating priorities in general? So any sense for what credit ratings you're trying to target for Apache, given the current commodity price environment and your view that you're no longer looking to spin Egypt or North Sea? And are there any targeted leverage metrics we can be thinking about or what is the right debt balance for the company?
P. Anthony Lannie: We are still working with the credit rating agencies on what our credit rating will be but we intend to pay down debt and have a very strong balance sheet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman of Raymond James. Your line is open.
John A. Freeman: Afternoon. I was looking at the rig count kind of break down if I wrote it down correctly, John, when you were going over the rigs in the Permian. And it looks like the Delaware Basin is about the only place in your whole portfolio where the rig count's not really changing from the November update. And obviously it makes sense, given at that time you all said that was the highest net present value per well. I'm just trying to get a sense of how you all think about the capital allocation, the Permian where trying to balance the fact the Delaware Basin is your highest NPV, but you're still running rigs in some of these other areas of the Permian.
John J. Christmann: The issue there is you correctly picked up that rig count did not change and our governors in the Delaware right now are more driven by infrastructure, take away capacity in those things. So you are exactly right. That is not a piece, it is at the top of the food chain. And it didn’t change. The others had to compete with the Permian and that's why when you look at we’ve got the lion share of our capital there, so Permian still will be getting 60% of our total North American capital and which is about in line with what we showed at the November update.
John A. Freeman: Okay and then last one for me, just thinking about these delayed completions, can you give just kind of a rough number on where your backlog of uncompleted wells stands in the Permian?
John J. Christmann: We’re kind of couple hundred total. Where the rig count's been, a lion's share of those would be in the Permian.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open.
James Sullivan: Hey good afternoon, guys. I wonder if you could just - we've been dancing around this a little bit - but just give us a Q4 fully-adjusted volume number. You guys gave the full-year number which is helpful for both international and North America. But just net of the LNG upstream, net of the North American packages, net of Australia and net of North Sea, that whole thing.
Gary T. Clark: Yes, hey. This is Gary. We are looking at about 319,000 a day as your pro forma Q4 number in North America. And about 225 international and offshore.
James Sullivan: Perfect, thank you very much for that. The other thing I had was, you guys gave some color which was a little bit distinct in your release, about completion costs. And it sounds like - you're the only guys that I've really heard saying that you're thinking about delaying completions, not just overall activity, into the second half of the year. With the thought, perhaps, that you'd capture a little bit more savings on the completion side, maybe. Could you speak to what you've seen in the market in terms of differential deflation rates on the drilling side, say the rig side and drilling versus fracking and completing the wells and whether that's driving your thinking? Or am I reading too much into your comments there?
John J. Christmann: Well, I mean I think the simple answer is we need to get the costs down in line with the oil price environment and when you look at 60% to 65% of your total well cost is in the completions, a lot of folks were assuming you'd just move through the backlog and keep completing the wells, but I mean that's some of the best things we can do right now to push those back because up front, significant savings there lets us drill other wells, so we're seeing substantial numbers on both the rig rates and then with what we've done basically by setting down most of the rigs, we're able to come in now and contract what prices should be in a $50 price environment and the same thing applies on the frac crews.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin of Societe Generale. Your line is open.
John P. Herrlin: Yes, thank you. John, since you've taken the helm, have you had any other leadership team changes other than the addition of Mr. Riney?
John J. Christmann: At this point given where we are John, we are taking a hard look at everything. I’ve taken a pretty measured approach of stepping in and had a lot of things to get knocked out off in early. I really want to think about what we have North America look like. I've got Tom in place on the international side and I'm going to take a very measured approach and think through what this thing ought to look like for the long-term and come out with something at a later day.
John P. Herrlin: Okay, thanks. On a pro forma basis for the U.S., what's your average decline rate now?
John J. Christmann: Right now if you look at our just in the U.S. our PDP decline is across all products. Oil is about 26%, our total streams around 24% in North America and that's just on a PDP basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Allman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Joseph D. Allman: Thank you, operator. Hi, everybody. So just to recount in North America, what's that rig count in the fourth quarter of 2015? And then, I know you answered this a little bit earlier, but if it's as low as I think it is, I would assume that going into 2016 it's going to be hard to keep production flat. And do you exhaust the wells waiting on completion? Do you exhaust those by the end of 2015?
John J. Christmann: All right. What I would say about that Joe is it will just depend on where we are and where prices are. I mean clearly if we are under $50 it will be lower than the average for the year considerably come in hot, but we are going to kind of let things dictate what we say going into the third and fourth quarter kind of based on where the market conditions are and also where the cost structure is. I mean that’s the other piece, we get cost down we would be able to pick up too so.
Joseph D. Allman: Okay, so second question, again, following up from the first. Do you exhaust the inventory of wells waiting on completion by year-end? And separate question, the $2 billion ceiling test write-down that you described, North Sea. You described US. You talked about some acreage that you're not going to drill. Could you give us more details on that please?
John J. Christmann: Well in terms of completion backlog we’ve got – that’s kind of at our disposal as to when we would complete those wells and obviously if we're an under 50 and prices have come on down and we will probably get some of those on and may choose to wait and see an increase in price when we go ahead and complete some of those wells. For the write down of the charges, I’m going to let Anthony handle that question.
P. Anthony Lannie: Yes, we haven’t provided any details in terms of split out between North America and North Sea at this point, but the total is $2 billion for the ceiling test and another $1.3 for the balance, for the impairment.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Doug Leggate: Thanks, good afternoon, John, and congratulations on your appointment. John, I wonder if I could ask you about the organizational capability from going from 80-plus rigs to 17 rigs. What does that do to you? If you were to look into being able to ramp that up again in the event of an oil price recovery, do you intend on keeping the organization static? Will you see some headcount reduction and cost reduction at the corporate level? Can you walk us through how you think about that and how patient you're prepared to be until the oil price recovers if you choose to do nothing?
John J. Christmann: Well Doug we have been looking at G&A, looking at it pretty hard in terms of ways to reduce it, we did announce we had some reductions in January about 5% worldwide when you look at the numbers, clearly we had an organization in place its capable of running 90 plus rigs in North America which at this point its less than that. So we will continue to look at things, one thing we are doing is we're taking some of our young engineers and we are putting them in the field which is allowing us to replace some contract folks so we’re being pretty smart about how to leverage folks, get some good experience and also puts us in a better position, in fact I have got a lot of good reports on the savings and some of the benefits that we’re having about putting those guys out in the field. So we are going be pretty prudent, in terms of what we do we will continue to look at what is the best organization for North America in terms of where things are going and do not worry about being over ramp up, I mean its easy to ramp up after you’ve been there before, I mean we’ve got great capabilities in the Permian and our other regions and it will not be hard to ramp up. And in fact I’ve got a lot of ways thankful because its gives us a chance to really look at our processes, our efficiencies, our inventory and really spend some time, high grading that and I will promise you will do it when we ramp up differently then would have been do it right now.
Doug Leggate: I know it's not an easy question to answer, so I appreciate the answer. I wonder if for my follow-up if I can go back to Bob's question earlier about the international strategy. I really just want to get clarification on this because for the past year, I guess there's been an expectation that the international business would be spun off completely. Is this a temporary situation? Is it now strategic? Can you help us understand what has flipped the Board's view on this? Because clearly it's a massive turnaround to decide to keep it. And will it compete for capital? I'm just trying to understand is this now – does the new Apache this time include Egypt and North Sea as go-forward assets? Or is this a stay of execution? I'll leave it there.
John J. Christmann: There’s a couple things. One of our key strategic objectives was to sell the LNG and that will close in the end of the first quarter. Secondly, we are looking at our conventional business in Australia, Egypt in the North Sea are different businesses then what we are doing in North America, but the thing you are going to look as generate free cash flow they always have had higher rate of return projects which complement our portfolio and clearly in this price environment it would not make sense to monetize them and they complete things very nicely. So at this point, there is no plans to sell or spin and they fit nicely with the portfolio when we ramp back up we will grow North America at faster rate.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Brian Singer: Thank you, good afternoon. Apache has a number of different opportunities within North America onshore to ramp up investment when the time is right. Based on what you're seeing now, what is the best way to do that? Do you see concentrating more in specific areas among the Delaware Basin versus Midland Basin versus East Texas, Eagle Ford to gain greater scale when you do want to ramp up and efficiencies? Or should we expect a gradual ramp up everywhere when the time is right?
John J. Christmann: A lot of that's going to depend on a lot of the strategic testing and the things we're doing in these plays right now. We're learning things each day. We've got the rig we're running in the Eagle Ford will be telling us very critical things as well as the Canyon Lime as well as the Permian so the good news is we've got a deep inventory and I'm confident we're going to have plenty of economic projects. We've got more right now than cash flow to spend at these levels so a lot of that Brian will just depend on how we see each of those plays at that time. One place is one of the questions earlier we have not slowed down in the Delaware and we will continue to try to expand that and then I think we're going to be in a position to we've gone from 12 rigs down to, we will be at four and down to one to two in the Eagle Ford. We can ramp that back up very quickly. The Canyon Lime we can put up at five or six in there and the neat thing is we're high grading a lot of prospects and a lot of acreage and we'll have a lot of choices to choose from.
Brian Singer: Thanks, and as my follow-up, and it actually follows up on a couple of questions earlier, and as well as your response here just now. You say you want your costs to come down, you want prices to go up. Your returns are strong from the portfolio today. But is what you're saying that every well that the 64 rigs you have dropped, or are planning to drop, achieve attractive returns at today's oil prices. But simply you've dropped them to stay within cash flow? Or are there areas where you need costs to come down to meet your return threshold? And if so, can you provide specifics?
John J. Christmann: It's a combination. There are a lot of those projects on the lower end that need prices down to where we want to drill them right now. But I can tell you where we made the cut based on our current cash flow I have more capabilities right now of economic projects we were electing to defer because we don't have to drill them. I mean the point is why drill them in this price environment when things are going to improve? So it's a combination.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis from Capital One Securities. Your line is open.
Richard Tullis: Thanks, good afternoon, everyone. John, following with the rate of return line there, so we saw the rates of return associated with your portfolio at the November meeting based on $80 oil, $4 gas. What do you think the impact is on the portfolio in general, using current commodities and the reductions you've seen in well costs to date?
John J. Christmann: Well there's no doubt that they drop. You go from 80 and 4 and you go to 50, and call it 50 and 290, apples-to-apples they have dropped. Now we are working on the cost side and we still have very attractive returns in the place where we are active, so but there's no doubt right now, the returns are costs haven't come down to put the returns in line with what we showed you and $80 a barrel in November.
Richard Tullis: Okay. And looking at the Eagle Ford A area, back in November it looked like you were going to be quite active there in 2015, running as many as 10 rigs with a fairly high rate of return. Why the significant change down to one rig now? And I'm not sure if that's going to be in the A or the B area? Has your thinking on that play changed any? Or is it more just a rate of return thing right now?
John J. Christmann: It’s neither its cash flow in the portfolio of what the dollar amount is so it's simply cash flow. We got more - there is lot’s of wells we could drill in the Eagle Ford right now, but it’s purely just a function of we aren't going to tap our balance sheet to develop production.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Your line is open.
Jeffrey L. Campbell: Hi, John. I'd like to second the congratulations on your new CEO role. First, I want to ask about Canada. I noticed you're going to stop drilling in March 2015. I just wondering will the completions be delayed there as you were talking about doing elsewhere? Because in November you made it clear this is an emergent play, so was just wondering if maybe the desire to see results would be a part of the calculus.
John J. Christmann: Well, Jeff, thank you. Two things. Number one, we do have excellent results and high hopes for Canada, and but there's two things. Montney wells we are going to be completing. There are little more dashing than the Duverney, and the Duverney wells have great economics, we will be completing the - we got a seven well pad there it’s testing two different spacings. We will be completing those in the third quarter of this year. It’s simply a function of cash flow in Canada is limiting how much we're spending in Canada so that's why and obviously with the winter drilling season we've come in very hot in Canada and actually Canada is going to be a slight out spend versus cash flow. So it’s purely same answer again. It’s cash flow driven is what's causing us to do that and the good news is after these two wells we had to hold acreage in the Montney we don't have any acreage problems in Canada this fall. And obviously if prices change going in third or fourth quarter you could see us decide to step back up. But we will right now, the plan would be not to do anything.
Jeffrey L. Campbell: Okay thanks and to ask a little bit different question. In Egypt we're reading a lot about the government trying to procure pipeline nat gas Israel as well as floating LNG. Is there any financial incentive to try to increase the natural gas production into the Egyptian market, because I notice your highlight wells are very high oil cuts.
John J. Christmann: Yes, I’m going to have Tom handle this one.
Thomas E. Voytovich: The answer is that the Egyption government has kept the gas price artificially low for 12 to 13 years now, 14 years and there is no indication that they have the willingness or desire to increase the domestic production gas price and as such, we continue to focus on oil and drill sufficient gas wells to keep our infrastructure full primarily by focusing on higher condensate yield reservoirs so that we could also increase liquids productions at the same time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is open.
Michael A. Hall: Thanks, appreciate the questions. I guess you provided the rig counts going forward for 2015. Maybe circling around this weighted uncompletion question in a little different way. How many wells do you anticipate to put on production regionally in 2015? And then how much of the, you said 200 or so in backlog, so I'm just trying to think through the organic program underlying that is...
John J. Christmann: Yes I would – we have not disclosed the well counts in terms of lay that much detail out in terms of the plan. We kind of hit on rigs and we have a couple hundred wells in addition to those and I mean, if we want to get back with them later Gary or something on details.
Gary T. Clark: Yes Michael, we can follow-up with you there, but we really haven’t kind of put anything out there on the specific well counts you know I just...
Michael A. Hall: Okay, but if -- relative to the Analyst Day in November, you cut the rigs probably 50% or more, or not quite. But is it fair to say then you're only taking the well count down by a quarter or so or is that simple math?
John J. Christmann: You can do it, you can probably do the math on the rigs, but the other factor is there costs are coming down, so it’s not straight linear math.
Michael A. Hall: Fair enough. And then you provided the PDP declines, that's helpful. How did that vary regionally?
John J. Christmann: That’s another things, I don’t have that detail for you. I’m just giving you a general on North America.
Michael A. Hall: That's fair and that's helpful. And then final one of mine, just housekeeping, on the budget for 2015, does that include capitalized interest? And if not, roughly do you all know what that might look like?
John J. Christmann: It does.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Wolff from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Jonathan D. Wolff: Afternoon, guys. I'm just looking at the numbers and intuitively spending about 36% of your budget in the first quarter and looking for exit rate that's similar. It just feels like there's a contemplated CapEx increase in here in the second half of the year, based on being able to achieve that type of momentum with the base decline rates that you've laid out. I'm just trying to get to the math. Is there a contemplated CapEx increase coming in May-June timeframe?
John J. Christmann: Not in this budget at all.
Jonathan D. Wolff: Can you give a little intuition on how you only have two-thirds of the budget left to spend in the last three quarters? It should be down dramatically in terms of the spending versus 2014. Is it a assumption that oil service costs are down 20%, 25%? Is it the expectation that oil prices are up $10? We're just having a hard time getting anywhere near the math on the domestic production.
John J. Christmann: Well it works fine on our end. I mean basically it's a function of how we spread the completions out. We've come in hot. We've got with Canada having completed it, you're not going to be completing those Duvernay wells until the third quarter. The math works. It's just a function of we pushed a lot of completions back and we'll bring them on at the appropriate time. But there's nothing baked in beyond, there's no capital increase. There's no oil price increase, you know we wouldn't be very smart to do that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani from RBC. Your line is open.
Leo Mariani: Hey guys, I just wanted to ask you a little about the M&A landscape. It sounds like in your prepared comments you spoke about rather buying acreage and maybe securing more assets as opposed to drilling. Can you talk about what you see out there that might be available? And what type of size of purchases are we talking about?
John J. Christmann: I mean I think the point is we would be opportunistic. I mean we see a potentially if things stay where they are there's a lot of folks that are significantly out spending. There is a lot of clocks on acreage. We're seeing things pop-up right now and for drilling a well we can earn pretty big acreage blocks. I think there's just a lot of opportunity that could surface and we would expect to surface.
Leo Mariani: All right. And moving over to your international guidance for 2015, you guys talked about 207,000 barrels a day, which I guess is after subtracting out final tax, working interest barrels and some tax barrels. Do you guys have that guidance numbers kind of prior to those subtractions? Because I know you guys reported that way in your financial just to keep it apples-to-apples for the financials?
John J. Christmann: I’ll let Gary.
Gary T. Clark: I’ll tell you what. Why don't we do this and follow-up because we've gone over the top of the hour. Why don’t we follow-up with offline on those, on that reconciliation.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin from Societe Generale. Your line is open.
John P. Herrlin: Yes, hi, just one quick follow-up. Obviously there's been a lot of questions regarding oil field services costs, completion costs, et cetera. On a going-forward basis, do you think the services providers will be more willing to index so you avoid kind of this boom-bust type pricing? Or will it just be business as always?
John J. Christmann: John I mean that’s one of the things we’ve looked very heavily at and we think it makes a lot of sands and quite frankly we should have done it a while back. So we would like to think that you can do that.
John P. Herrlin: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And your last question comes from the line of James Sullivan from Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open.
James Sullivan: Hey guys, thanks for running this call real quick, do a little follow-up. Can you guys talk a little bit about what you're doing in Central Oklahoma? You guys did put the Woodford wells up on the ops report, but are you guys targeting some of the multi-lateral areas there with the Springer and the Merrimac and other stuff? Just get a little detail on that.
John J. Christmann: Yes, I mean as I mentioned we are going to have one rig pretty much dedicated. We will be drilling some Woodford wells. We've got about 200,000 acres gross 50,000 net so we will be active there with that and we’ve also got some really look in economic prospects in some of our other plays. So its juts simply budgeting our capital there, but you will see some more Woodford wells from us.
James Sullivan: Great, and just a quick follow-up to that. Is that one of the areas you guys talked in the leasehold work you've been doing. I think East Eagle Ford probably got some of that money and some of the other areas, but are you working there as well with the leasehold?
John J. Christmann: We have been working to fill in and bolter on our position, but that’s relevant for all of our key areas where we would be active drilling. End of Q&A
Operator: This concludes today's Q&A session. I now turn the call back over the Mr. Clark.
Gary T. Clark: Well thank you everybody for joining us and please follow-up with myself or my team in IR if we can handle any of the other details that we didn’t get to on the call today and we look forward to speaking to you all next quarter. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Gary Clark: Thank you, Jennifer. Good afternoon, everybody. And thank you for joining us for Apache’s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. On today’s call, we will have three speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. I will start by giving a brief summary of results and then we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman, CEO and President; followed by Anthony Lannie, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Also joining us for the question-and-answer session are John Christmann, Executive Vice President and COO of North America; and Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President and COO of International. Please note that we have streamlined our supplemental earnings disclosures this quarter. We are replacing our financial supplement and our operation supplement with a single quarterly earnings supplement. Most of the financial disclosures previously found in the financial supplement can now be found in the tables attached to our earnings release, as well as the 10-Q. Our new streamlined earnings supplement will continue to summarize our operational activities for the quarter and include well heights across various Apache operating regions. The supplement also includes information on E&P capital expenditures and the visual graphic to illustrate cash sources and uses that reconcile changes in net debt quarter-over-quarter. Our earnings release accompanying the financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations, and our new quarterly supplement can all be found on our website at apachecorp.com/financialdata. Today’s discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. This morning we reported a third quarter 2014 loss of $1.3 billion or $3.50 per diluted share, adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results totaled $528 million or $1.38 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital totaled $2.1 billion during the quarter. Worldwide reported net production averaged 637,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with liquids production constituting 60% of that total. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for recent assets sales and excluding the non-controlling interest and tax bills from Egypt, our second quarter worldwide production was 562,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This represents a 2% increase from the second quarter and a 6% increase from the same period a year ago. I will now call -- turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Farris: Thank you, Gary, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank everybody for joining us. During the third quarter, Apache continued to make progress on our transition to becoming a premier North American resource company, delivering another quarter of strong production growth. Our North American drilling program delivered on-shore liquids production growth of 5% sequentially and 15% year-over-year, when adjusted for our asset divestitures. We had strong performance in the Permian and it continues to drive North American results. I want to go back, if you recall during our February 2014 Investor Day, we provided guidance for our Permian production growth from 12% to 15% for the year. Through the nine months ending September 30, our production increased 25%, nearly doubling our February guidance. This increase growth is a result of mix shift to more horizontal drilling. For example, our horizontal well count is up 50% and our vertical count is down 40% through the first nine months of this year compared to same period last year. The biggest drivers of growth in the Permian were our Wolfcamp horizontals in the Southern Midland Basin, our Yeso program in the Northwest shelf and our horizontal Bone Springs wells in the Delaware Basin. A particular note, our Pecos Bend area in Reeves County completed four very strong Bone Springs wells during the quarter. The average 30-day IP of these new wells was over a 1,000 barrels equivalent per day. In our Eagle Ford play, we’ve ramped up activity throughout the year and we are now running 10 rigs there. Strong results coupled with our relentless focus on lowering well costs are allowing this play to compete very well for capital within Apache’s capital program. During the quarter, we spud 29 wells, including wells on four separate pads and brought on our first two pads online in the Reveille area Williston County with an average 30-day IP of 609 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The success of our Eagle Ford program to-date coupled with our expectations for lower well costs and higher rates of return have prompted us to allocate more capital to this play in 2014 than we originally budgeted. Turning to the central region, we have retooled the organization, we have significantly reduced our rig count, we have made numerous process improvements and reprioritized our focus following our challenging first half 2014. We are scaling back our traditional Granite Wash and Tonkawa plays in the Anadarko Basin and we are focusing more on our drilling program in the Canyon Lime play in Oldham and Potter County in Texas Panhandle. As of this morning, we had 16 rigs running in the Anadarko Basin and four in the promising Canyon Lime. In our Duverney and Montney plays in Canada, we ran three rigs total and spud initial wells at the Duverney seventh well pad and drilled the first well at our Montney two well pad. The Duverney and the Montney offer some of the best reservoir rock in North America and we are looking forward to these plays driving our strong production growth once we have optimized our well costs and our completions. We are continuing to high-grade our North American asset base through the addition of leasehold in key growth areas and the sale of non-core acreage. During the quarter, we invested $520 million primarily in leasehold in the sweet spots of our key growth areas. This opportunistic investment was the big driver of the capital cost increase you see in our financial table. We plan to fund our increased investment primarily through the sale of non-core North American assets which we currently have in the market. We’re looking forward to sharing these details in our acreage purchases as well as providing an update on perspective asset sales on November 20th. Looking ahead, we’re confident that our 2014 North American liquids production growth will come in at the higher end of our 15% to 18% guidance range which led predominantly by better-than-expected production out of our Permian region. To sum it up, we are encouraged by the progress we're making in North America, both in our ability to drive cost out of the system as well as improve our well performance. And we are looking forward to providing a lot more detail in the next few weeks when we visit New York City. Turning to our international operations, all three of our regions, North Sea, Egypt and Australia delivered profitable production growth and remain on track to generate significant free cash flow per year. As a result, third quarter worldwide volumes came in slightly above the second quarter at 637,000 barrel equivalent per day, which is right in line with our internal expectations. In the North Sea, we completed our annual third quarter maintenance turnaround with no material delays. Production losses from scheduled downtime was partially offset by strong drilling results at Forties in our first well from The Forties Alpha Satellite Platform. In Egypt, we executed on a very active exploration and development program. During the quarter, we drilled eight new well discoveries in a call to concession. One of the most notable of which was Meghar-08 which IPed at nearly 3200 barrels oil equivalent a day. And yesterday, we tested our [Matruh] (ph) number one exploration well on Western Shushan Basin for over 7000 barrels of oil per day. Operations and production in Egypt continued with no material disruptions during the quarter. And finally in Australia, we made headway on several projects. Our Balnaves’ FPSO came online at the end of August and is currently producing at 18,000 barrels of oil per day net to our interest. We continue to progress our Coniston oil development and remain on track for first oil during the first half of 2015. In closing, I want to reemphasize the strategic direction we laid out on our second quarter earnings call. We remain committed to exiting our two LNG projects, Wheatstone and Kitimat. And we are continuing to evaluate the separation of our international assets through either strategic transactions or the capital markets. And with that, I’d like to turn it over to Anthony Lannie.
Anthony Lannie: Thanks Steve. As mentioned earlier, we believe our North American onshore resource base is capable of driving strong growth and returns over the foreseeable future. And we continue to take important steps in that direction and allocate resources accordingly. In tandem with our strategic shift towards our North American onshore assets, we took the following two steps during the quarter. We determined that the undistributed earnings in our Australia, Egypt and North Sea regions should no longer be considered permanently reinvested in our foreign operations. This change in policy results in a non-cash charge to U.S. deferred income tax expense of $814 million on those regions for undistributed earnings. In addition, we repatriated $1.9 billion of cash from our Egypt region during the third quarter for which we recognized an associated non-cash U.S. tax expense of $249 million. Bringing this cash back to the U.S. will provide us additional balance sheet flexibility and liquidity as we delineate several promising onshore plays and expand our acreage holdings while at the same time repurchasing Apache’s stock. Turning to the income statement. As Gary noted at the outset, we reported a quarterly loss of $1.3 billion or $3.50 per share, which was driven by two significant items. The first is the $1.1 billion of income tax related charges that I just mentioned, in which reflect the change in our permanent reinvestment policy and repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. The second item is an approximate $1 billion after-tax non-cash ceiling test write down primarily related to lower oil and NGL price realizations and the impact of unamortized deepwater costs that remained in our full cost pool following the sale of our Lucius and Heidelberg projects at the end of the second quarter. When excluding these items, along with other more typical non-cash items such as mark-to-market derivatives and foreign currency exchanges, our adjusted earnings were $528 million or $1.38 per share, down from $644 million or $1.67 per share in the second quarter. Operating cash flow remains strong, driven by performance of our North American onshore base. We generated $2.1 billion of cash flow from operations before working capital items, which was down slightly from $2.2 billion in each of the first two quarters of 2014. Despite strong production numbers, our bottom line results were impacted by lower commodity prices. In North America, our oil price realizations averaged $94.69 per barrel in the third quarter, down 9%, compared to the second quarter. Gas price realizations averaged $3.88 per Mcf, down 7% from the second quarter, but still 9% higher than the comparable 2013 period. We ended the third quarter with just over $1 billion of restricted and unrestricted cash on our balance sheet, bringing our total -- our net debt to $9.9 billion. Year-to-date, we have invested $7.5 billion in our drilling programs, of which approximately $626 million is related to opportunistic acreage and leasehold acquisitions onshore North America. Our strong free cash flow from foreign operations and low debt-to-cap ratio of 25% provides Apache the liquidity to support both our North American growth and share repurchase program. On the expense side, LOE per Boe was up 5% quarter-over-quarter to $11.13. This is in line with the expectations we set on the first quarter call. The increase is driven by general increases in labor and power costs and our divestment of lower-cost dry gas properties. Turning to income taxes, our third quarter effective tax rate reflects the impact of the aforementioned change in our foreign earnings reinvestment policy, along with the full cost ceiling test write downs as well as other non-recurring items. Absent these items, our adjusted effective tax rate would have been 43.5%, which is in line with previous guidance. Our adjusted earnings and adjusted effective tax rate recalculations can be found in our supplemental financial information attached to this morning's press release. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo: Good morning. I guess it’s good afternoon. Lot of moving pieces, but can you talk about where Canada fits in big picture going forward?
Steve Farris: What I think you’ve seen from 2014 -- I mean, 2013 and 2014, we’ve really high-graded our portfolio up there. We basically have two real major plays up there, which is the Duvernay and the Montney. Right now that is going to be our growth drivers for going forward.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo: Okay. I don’t what you say ahead of the North American update? But if I think about the Permian, production -- can you just talk about how you see production? It look like it’s slowed a little bit in the quarter but I mean, that could just be noise and timing or completion, et cetera. But can you talk about that growth trajectory over the next 12 to 18 months?
John Christmann : I mean, the first key is we are having a great year. When you look at the well count over the first three quarters of last year, our horizantals were up 50%, as we kind of shifted our program. We are currently running 41 rigs. You’ve seen us dropping the verticals as well. So actually, we are working quite a bit ahead where you had guided to 12 to 15% and we are looking at year-end numbers. We are going to put you twice the lower end. So we feel really strong about that. I think going into next year, we'll get into that on the November 20th, but a lot of that will depend on the commodity price forecast and how much cash we want to invest there. The big deal is, I think we feel good about the projects and we have a lot of flexibility with the rig count. So we are in a good spot going into next year.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America: Thank you. Good afternoon everybody. Steve, the step-up in the East Eagle Ford, obviously that’s a newer play for you. I guess, we are going to hear more about that at the end of the month. But I’m just kind of curios, if you could help right for us in this oil price environment, how that play would stack up against your Wolfcamp assets and in particular, how would you allocate capital or prioritize your allocation of capital towards the central areas and more gassy areas in the portfolio and I have a follow-up, please?
Steve Farris: Yeah. Thank you. Honestly, we are tremendously pleased and excited about the future of the Eagle Ford and I don’t want to steal our guys thunder for November 20th. But we’ve seen our latest wells continue to get better and we are driving quite a bit of cost out of the system. Our view is that’s going to be a major play for us going forward, especially in 2015, 2016 and beyond. And some of that acreage that we talk about and we will show you this more on November 20th. We’ve increased -- basically that acreage is made up of two parts. One is we’ve increased the acreage in our interest and our existing acreage by buying some of our partners out and the other one is aggregating acreage right around what we think the sweet spot is. So, John, you might want to comment?
John Christmann: I mean, I think, directionally, when you look at where we are, we dropped our rig count in the Anadarko. Steve mentioned, we are down to 20 rigs now. So you see that drop in conjunction with the Eagle Ford ramp-up and that will continue going into next year. So that directionally tells you where they are and we’re looking at the portfolio, things that migrate to the top quick, they are going to be the Eagle Ford, the Canyon Lime and the Permian and lots of plays there. So it’s going to compete very, very well.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America: I appreciate. My follow-up is really more about -- I guess you don't talk too much about the restructuring, but the issue around -- the subtlety of the issue around the international cash or free cash flow, which I guess is previously accelerating the drilling program to some extent in the Lower 48. With the separation of the international business and the lower oil price, how does that impact your -- I guess your willingness to spend outside of cash flow to bring forward the volumes to some of these newer plays? So I guess I am really trying to understand is operating cost flow, is that still a limiter for spending in the Lower 48 or the standalone company? Or should be expected to use the balance sheet and I will leave it there? Thank you.
Steve Farris: Yeah. I might make a general comment. I think we -- over the last two months we’ve seen a $20 move in oil prices. I think all of us have to look at that. We certainly are looking at it in terms of making sure we’re prudent and what our capital program is going forward. I will tell you from an investment opportunity standpoint, we are better off right now and we have been in Lower 48 over the last two or three years. We have tremendous inventory right now, good inventory. I doubt if you see us until we understand where this price is going be really bullish on overspending our cash flow going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of John Freeman with Raymond James.
John Freeman - Raymond James: Good afternoon. The Canyon Lime is the one area in the central region that you all are increasing activity on and it seems like each quarter the commentary is more bullish. I think now you are kind of ranking as one of your three best North American areas since that Bivens well that you had. And I just want to make sure that I’ve got on the right numbers. When you entered the year that was about 100,000 net acres that was prospective for either the Canyon Wash or the Canyon Lime, is that still a good number to use? I mean, you’ve obviously been busy buying acreage across North America.
Steve Farris: We are going to show a lot more of that on November 20. We have more acreage than -- we have more acreage today than we have in the past.
John Freeman - Raymond James: Okay. I want still (indiscernible). I will wait on that. And then just my follow-up question. On Egypt you mentioned that there was the sequential production decline was due primarily to some technical challenges as well as some partial shutdowns on a shale operated gas plant. Can you just kind of give maybe an update on that status?
Steve Farris: I will let Tom Voytovich who really got the details on that to answer that question.
Tom Voytovich: Well to directly answer the technical challenges, there is a gas plant, the old biogas plant which has been rife with problems with the Benfield system and they have shale operated gas plant. It’s the only outside operated plant that we participate in. And as a result of that, out takes have gone down materially 30 million to 50 million cubic feet a day and that really accelerated here in the latter part of the third quarter. We think that this is going to continue through the rest of the year, but we will be making up for it in other ways.
Steve Farris: Now the only caveat I would give that is, is in the Egypt 88% of our revenues come from our oil. Gases is percentage wise a bigger chunk of our production on a Boe basis, but 88% of our revenues come from the oil side.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Good afternoon. Following up on the earlier question on free cash flow. In a lower oil price environment, if you are committed for Apache to stay within cash flow, is there any change to how you're thinking about the strategic nature of some of your free cash generative businesses like the North Sea and Egypt? Is there a case that perhaps you keep that as part of Apache for longer and use that free cash flow? If not, do you see yourself potentially having to cut back on activities in areas that you may rank in your top 3 plays like the Eagle Ford, Canyon Lime or Permian?
Steve Farris: Brian, I think the statement that we made in our second quarter earnings call and I reiterated today, we are committed to exiting the LNG facilities and truthfully we are -- we’ve got lots of people working on those projects to do just that. In terms of evaluating our international assets for possible transactions or spends, that’s an ongoing process and we continue to look at it everyday. Certainly I think our -- truthfully I think our North American business today and I probably wouldn’t have said this a year ago or year and half ago is very capable of standing on its own. I mean, I think we’ve got the inventory and I think what you’re going to see in November 20 is we now have the capabilities and the leadership in the regions to be able to do that.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Allman with JPMorgan.
Joe Allman - JPMorgan: Thank you, Operator. Hi, everybody. Steve, could you just clarify your strategic direction? So we understand that you plan on exiting the LNG business. But, do you plan to exit the international business? And has there been any even nuisance change just based on data or thinking more deeply about things, about whether to exit the international business?
Steve Farris: No, I don’t think so. I think, our plan, our strategic vision is to separate our North American form our international business. I mean, no -- nobody else, I mean when I say think, it’s just -- we have the same thinking today that we have in the past.
Joe Allman - JPMorgan: Okay. That’s helpful. And then onshore North America activity, on a net basis are you in the process of ramping up the North America drilling activity and spending, or are you keeping things flat or you actually on the net basis reducing activity and spending over the next several months?
Steve Farris: Well, I think, I guess I will reiterate the answer I gave a little early or the fact of the matter is, we’ve had by anybody’s calculations we’ve got a real sea change in oil prices. I think we’re all going to have a look at how we run businesses at $80 oil in North America and without blowing out your balance sheet. So depending on what happens to oil prices, we’re running a number of different cases, but we’re going to -- our capital program is going to be somewhere around what our cash flow is going into 2015.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe from TPH.
Michael Rowe - TPH: Yes. I have a quick question on the Anadarko. So I guess you’re down to 20 rigs now versus 30 or so that we’re averaging Q3 and you specifically highlighted the Granite Wash and Tonkawa two intervals that you are hitting activity. I was wondering is that purely driven by tribal economics given where commodities prices are. Or was there I guess something else unique going on there operationally that cause those two specific targets to see less drilling?
John Christmann: As we mentioned or Steve mentioned in the script, I mean, we retooled and even on the last call we’ve changed out our entire leadership in our central region. So we’ve addressed the region VP as well as the Op. So the good news is in all of our plays, we still got good wells and good things there. We have shifted the rig count a little bit. We pared back as Steve said in the script and the talk on the Granite Wash. We’ve got a few more running in the Cleveland and the Cottage Grove, where we’re having some good results. And we’re also shifting to the Canyon Lime. But I think when you look at that portfolio and the mix, you’ll see a shift towards the Eagle Ford and the Permian and the Canyon Lime as we look at next year.
Michael Rowe - TPH: Okay, great. And then just lastly on the $520 million spend for leasehold and property acquisitions in Q3. Is this part of a broader effort to I guess increase M&A activity relative to drilling given where commodity prices are now, just curious to see, if you are all thinking about easing capital for M&A has been changed versus prior expectations?
Steve Farris: Gary, do you want on the Rockies then I handle.
Gary Clark: Yeah. I mean, we have really seen an opportunistic -- opportunity this year to add some exceptional acreage in our key growth areas and so we’ve taken advantage of that. I wouldn’t say that it’s necessarily a sea change and how we view acreage acquisition and M&A, but the reality is we need to high-grade the portfolio. And as we’ve matured our key plays and demonstrated a lot of confidence and what we can accomplish there, we have seen a interesting opportunity to beep up in the sweet spots of those key plays. And at the same, we will divest and are divesting some of our areas where that are not going to attract capital and that are not on the growth track and they have lower rates of return. So what you all seen is our spending in the third quarter, what’s pending is the divestitures that will cover a lot of that spending.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale.
John Herrlin - Societe Generale: Yeah. Hi. Three quick ones. With respect to the asset packages, can you give us a ballpark on associated volumes with them?
Steve Farris: Well, we’re going to do that November 20th. We have got a -- I will say, we’ve got a package related to that we’re keen on. We’ve got a package in South Louisiana, our South Louisiana stuff its legacy, we’ve had for sometime. And we’ve also got some properties in central region that are gassy and we’re not spending money on. So you’ll see what that looks like in -- on November 20th.
John Herrlin - Societe Generale: Okay. Thanks, Steve. How much does your typical Eagle Ford well run on a complete well cost basis?
John Christmann: John, we’ll get into that on November 20th, but they’re going to come in under $8 million Eagle Ford well cost.
Gary Clark: We told you $8.3 in February and we’re doing better than that now and we’ve got our site set lower but we’ll share more on the 20th.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles Meade - Johnson Rice: Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. Steve, if I could go back to maybe try to tie two questions together. As we look at or as I look at your debt trajectory, you had been on a trajectory down with debt, not every quarter, but generally over the last six quarters. But you have had tick up this quarter. And I’m wondering if perhaps that might be tied into a view that you are more likely to actually have an outright sale of some assets, whether it would be Wheatstone or maybe some of your conventional, all assets in Australia and that might be a source of funds to get that debt back down or alternatively if you're comfortable with debt in that $10 million to $11 million range going forward?
Steve Farris: Well, I think the absolute debt is not as important as what we consider what our debt structure should be overall. In terms of our debt going up a little bit this year, I mean, this quarter, I think Gary has pointed out and I think, I pointed out earlier. We made some strategic buys of undeveloped acreage and what you’re seeing is you got a timing difference between we’re selling non-core assets, which should come in the fourth quarter. And the acreage acquisitions that we’ve seen in the third quarter, so those two should balance out over the year.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.
Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors: Thanks. Well, one of my have been addressed. I guess, just one on East Texas, I’m just curious on those wells and maybe, I might have to wait but I figure I’ll ask. What the hydrocarbon splits look like on those wells, on average and then maybe high and low case splits?
John Christmann: I mean, we’ll get into that in detail when we -- we’ll show some data on November 20th but they really -- I mean, we mentioned the first couple pads have come on in the Reveille of average 690 Boes a day and that’s in a lower GOR area. One thing across our acreage that GOR does move, so it just depends on the area but we’ll go through that in detail on November 20th.
Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors: Okay. Steve. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.
Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research: Good afternoon. A little while go you called out the Montney and the Duvernay, but I found it interesting that you have three rigs devoted to the Bluesky formations in the Kaybob. And could you provide a little color here? Is it vertical or is it horizontal, is it developmental or expiration? Why is Bluesky attracting this rig?
John Christmann: Jeff, they’re just economics, they’re good wells, they are all horizontals and the economics are fantastic on them. So we can get the rigs in there and we’ve got three elements there. They’re cheaper, they are not as expensive and they help the program so. But the economics are very compelling.
Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research: Okay. Kind of staying on this sort of theme. We’ve had earlier discussions of the pan shale as more of a standalone horizontal target. But this quarter you showed us three highlight vertical wells that featured the 10 combination with the Strawn and the Wolfcamp. Were these expirations wells preparing for later horizontal drilling, or does this vertical drilling have legs of its own?
John Christmann: No, that’s another area. I mean, you’ve got to look across the counties and we’ve got some areas where we are drilling horizontally in the Pan and the Strawn and we will show little bit of that on November 20th. In this particular area, we highlighted some wells that are North of Odessa and the [Gustav Bay] (ph) area and some vertical wells that we can stack those and they are also very compelling. We saw fantastic rates from those so. It shows you the variety in the Permian and you’ve got lots of zones, lots of area and different plays but they are very economic.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis of Capital One.
Richard Tullis - Capital One: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Steve, I don’t think this area has been touched on. How does the remaining Gulf of Mexico shelf assets fit into your strategy going forward in this lower oil price environment. I know in the past you’ve mentioned that you expect it to perhaps begin drilling some of the deeper shelf targets in 2015?
Steve Farris: Yeah. Right now, we are building inventory. I might point for those listening we have --we kept half of the deep rights when we sold our shelf. And we have about 500 blocks of deep rights under our existing shelf acreage that we sold. And truthfully that’s -- if we have a very good idea there, we’ll fund it otherwise that we will continue to build inventory.
Richard Tullis - Capital One: Okay. And just as a follow up, what sort of price is required to -- oil price to generate expectable rate of return in the shelf for the type of well as you anticipate drilling?
Steve Farris: Actually the shelf rates of return are very, very strong. And especially if you are drilling them, the reason we kept the deep rights is we sold 700 platforms. And so most of the deep rights are in and around the existing infrastructure. So you time back quicker and you can get them on quicker. And you don’t have the infrastructure cost that you do when you are under deepwater going out and doing expiration.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of John Herrlin of Societe Generale.
John Herrlin - Societe Generale: Yeah. Hi last one for me. With the ceiling test, how much of it was the unamortized deepwater cost and was that all a U.S. pull or was there some Canada in there as well?
Anthony Lannie: It was about 50-50. And it was all in the U.S.
John Herrlin - Societe Generale: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC.
Leo Mariani - RBC: Hey, with respect to your 2015 budget, trying to get a sense of when we would get a look at that? And I guess would we get a sense of spending on November 20th in terms of your North American on throughput?
Steve Farris: Yeah. We are going to roll out what our 2015 and then our forward plan is, what our outlook is over the next several years. And our capital budget for 2015 will be part of that.
Leo Mariani - RBC: All right, that’s helpful. And I guess just in terms of the international sales. I guess, it’s an ongoing process here. Clearly, I guess, we are in position now where oil prices have come in. Just trying to gauge your apatite in terms of spinning things off versus sales here?
Steve Farris: I think they are both viable. I will tell you the one thing we’ve said and I think we’ve constantly done, we are not going to sell something just to get rid of it. And ultimately the separation will partly be, I am sure a span of some of our assets.
Operator: And we have no further question in queue at this time.
Gary Clark: That concludes the call. Thank you all for joining us and we’ll talk to you on November 20th.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference call and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Sia and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation Second Quarter Earnings 2014 Conference. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you, at this time I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Castlen Kennedy. Please go ahead ma’am.
Castlen Kennedy:  Thank you, Sia. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation’s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. On today’s call, we will have three speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. I will start by giving a brief summary of results and then we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President; followed by Alfonso Leon, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, joining us for the question-and-answer session are John Christmann, Executive Vice President and COO of North America; and Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President and COO of International. We prepared our quarterly financial supplement for your use, which includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings or cash flow from operations. In addition, we have prepared our quarterly operation supplement which summarizes our activities and includes detailed well highlights across the various Apache operating region. These can both be found on our website at apachecorp.com/financialdata. Today’s discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to defer materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data on our website. This morning we reported second quarter 2014 earnings from continuing operations of $505 million or $1.31per diluted share. Adjusted earnings which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $644 million or $1.67 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital totaled $2.2 billion during the quarter. Total reported net production averaged 635,814 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with liquids production constituting 59% of the total. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for recent sales and excluding the non-controlling interest and tax barrels from Egypt second quarter production was 550,357 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with liquids production constituting 60% of the total. I’ll now turn the call over to Steve.
G. Steven Farris:  Thank you, Castlen and good afternoon, everyone and thank you all for joining us. I want to apologize everyone, I’ve got somewhat of a summer cold, so I sound a little – my sounds a little deeper than it usually does I apologize. Our second quarter results provided I think additional evidence of our strong North America position, and our ability to continue to profitability grow our production. And before I jump into the details of the quarter, I want to provide an update on Apache’s ongoing repositioning of profitable and repeatable North American onshore growth. Over the last five years Apache has greatly enlarged and enhanced its North American onshore resource base and I believe that it is capable of driving our growth and performance over the next several years. During the last 18 months, we’ve been increasing the focus on our North American onshore business, by divesting of around $10 billion of property. In addition, we’ve launched an aggressive stock repurchase program and we’ve also made it clear there are no sacred cows and our efforts continue. There has been recent discussion regard Apache’s potential future steps and focusing our portfolio, and today’s call gives me an opportunity to provide an update to our shareholders on our direction and the work that it’s been underway. First, let me state at the outset, the Apache’s future will be centered on our tremendous North American onshore resource base. Second, I’d like to make it clear, that Apache intends to completely access the Wheatstone and Kitimat LNG project. And third, in light of our expanding opportunity set in North American onshore, we are evaluating our international assets and are exploring multiple opportunities including the potential for separation of some or all of them through the capital markets. And one additional note regarding our North American onshore portfolio, over the past year, we deepened our understanding of our North American properties. We’ve elevated our capabilities in advanced emerging plays and in that regard this fall we intend to hold an update presentation on North American onshore highlighting our $1.7 million net acres in the Permian basin. So, with that out of the way, let me move to the details of our performance in the second quarter. This morning we announced second quarter results of $644 million or $1.67 per share of adjusted earnings, and $2.2 billion of cash flow from operations before changes in working capital. During the quarter our operational focus in extensive acreage position across our best hydrocarbon region rich basins allowed us to drive production growth in North American onshore liquids. On a pro forma basis, we averaged 201,000, 395,000 barrels of oil per day, which is up 18% year-over-year. North American onshore liquids represented nearly 61% of our total worldwide liquids production and 37% of our overall production. A corner stone of our North American onshore success has been the outstanding performance in the Permian basin. And through the first half of the year, the Permian region’s performance is ahead of our plan. In fact we surpassed the significant milestone earlier this year as we celebrated reaching 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent and a day net. We have come a long way since we launched the regions just over four years ago. And have grown production nearly 200% since that time. In fact, we have grown production 17 out of the last 18 quarters, and the last 11 quarters consecutively. Cash flow from the region is coming in ahead of plan. And we anticipate the region will fully fund its capital program for the year. We expect to deliver over 23% liquids growth and more than 20% Boe growth for the year. And this performance demonstrates our focus on operational excellence and are driving out of cost from the system. And it underscores Apache’s leading position in the Permian. In the Anadarko Basin, our Central Region has experienced several challenges over the last couple of quarters. And as a result production growth has been disappointing. Our total wells drilled to-date for the year is 26% behind plan due to weather slowdowns as well as mechanical difficulties in both drilling and completion. We’re retooling the region in addition to recently making personnel changes or scaling back the Anadarko Basin activity and reducing capital and rigs. We continue to believe in the growth opportunities in the Anadarko Basin, we just need to slowdown and assure our selves we’re making good investment decisions over the long term. We do intend to ramp up our drilling activity in our Central Region Canyon mine play and Oldham and Potter County of Texas Panhandle. And I’ll touch on this in more detail a little later. As we said in the past, we view North American onshore business as one large resource comprised of several different plays and we will allocate capital and resources to the best opportunities within that portfolio. Despite the challenges we had in the Anadarko Basin, I want to reiterate our 15% to 18% North American onshore liquids guidance. And I also want to reiterate our 5% to 8% increase in our production, overall production guidance. We have a significant opportunity before us in North American onshore and the ability and expertise to continue to execute and deliver growth in the years to come. I’d like to specifically mention a few highlights from the quarter and share some of the results we are most excited about. I want to start in North American onshore Permian Basin, we have averaged 37 rigs, 24 of which were horizontal, and we grew production 4% over the previous quarter. Year-over-year we’re seeing total production growth of an impressive 26%. We had a strong Wolfcamp shale results in Regan County in Southern Midland Basin. For example, our SRH 1335 had a 24-hour rates of 1,184 barrels of oil equivalent a day. We also had impressive results in the Bone Spring of the Delaware Basin, with several new wells coming on in Reeves and Loving County, including the Robin 8 with 24-hour rate of nearly 1,200 barrels of oil per day. And our East Texas Eagle Ford play in Brazos and Burleson counties, we continue to be very excited about our opportunity in this emerging play. We’d recently added additional acreage and now hold over 2,000 net acres in the play. We’re shifting to more of an appraisal mode in our drilling from pads to further reduce cost and enhance returns. We have spud 26 wells during the quarter, with most scheduled to come on line frankly in the third quarter, the Reveille 8H was completed during the second quarter in a 24-hour IP of 987 barrels of oil equivalent a day. We also have early test on wells coming on in first part of the third quarter, including the nearby Reveille 10H and 14H which had 24-hour IPs of 906 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 1,220 barrels of oil equivalent per day, respectively. With these strong results and our tremendous land position we decided to further ramp our activity up and should be running 10 rigs by year-end in this play. In the Canyon Lime play in the Texas Panhandle, we also have seen strong results, specifically our most recent well the Bivins 94-1H at a 30-day IP of 1,718 barrels of oil equivalent a day. We hold approximately 100,000 net contiguous acres in this play and are planning to drill a total of six wells this year to further delineate the play and we should have four rigs running active in this play by year end. Turning to Canada, in our first quarter call, we disclosed that we had drilled the Duverney and Montney wells. The initial production rates has been encouraging. For an example, in the Duverney in the first quarter we completed well 24-hour rate of 1,963 barrels of oil equivalent a day. And in the Montney our first well was completed in the first quarter, had a 30 day IP of 926 barrels of oil equivalent a day. And with these positive results, we’re looking to increase activities in these plays and plan to spud 10 wells in the Duverney and two wells in the Montney by year-end 2014. We’ve also been adding to our acreage position in both these plays, we now have 146,000 net acres in the Montney and 177,000 net acres in the Duverney. I want to take a second and shift to our international region. Production was in line with expectations as we held it flat over the previous quarter. We remain on track to generate significant free cash flow for the year from our international regions. In the North Sea second quarter production was up 7% quarter-over-quarter, as we recovered from a difficult winter. We drilled eight new wells during the second quarter including a new well in the Beryl field that achieved 30-day IP of 4,500 barrels of oil equivalent a day. And our (indiscernible) well that achieved an average 30-day IP of 1,500 barrels of oil per day. During the quarter in Egypt, we had additional exploration success, we had notable tests in the AEB, Safa, and Paleozoic reservoirs as well as the horizontal test in Upper Bahariya. Following Phase I of our (indiscernible) development project the field is now producing at peak productions and we’ve also seen record oil and gas production from successful work on the BP acquired call to two properties at Abu Gharadig and Razak. And finally, in Australia we continue to make progress on several of our new projects. Our Balnaves project is expected to come online in the third quarter, in fact we expect first of all in the next few weeks. I want to point out our Coniston development project which is originally scheduled for first oil during the third quarter of 2014 is now going to be delayed until early 2015. Our FPSO, the Ningaloo Vision were delivered to the shipyard in Singapore early part of this year to undergo process upgrades and capacity expansion, which will require to bring on our new Coniston wells. During a deep hole inspection coincident with the upgrade, it was discovered that it had significant structural steel replacement problem that was necessary to ensure its long-term safety and integrity of production up time for this FPSO. The repair work is well underway; it should start up later than initially planned. However, and this delayed start up does not, but I want to point out this delayed start up does not impact our overall production guidance. As I mentioned earlier, we are on track to deliver our production guidance for 15% to 18% North American onshore liquids growth and our global BOE expected growth of 5% to 18%, based on our 2013 production on a pro forma basis. Finally, before I turn the call over to Alfonso, I want to briefly touch on our buyback program, utilizing proceeds primarily from divestments during the quarter Apache bought back an additional $780 million worth of stock. This brings our total expense the launch of our buyback program through the end of the second quarter to nearly $2.3 billion or 26 million shares. As a reminder during the second quarter our Board increased our authorization by 10 million shares to 40 million shares. And we continue to be Apache shares at compelling value at current prices. With that, I would like the turn the call over to Alfonso
Alfonso Leon:  Thank you, Steve. I’m going to cover some balance sheet highlights and provide production and financial expectations for the remainder of the year. First, with respect to our balance sheet, during the second quarter we completed three significant portfolio focusing steps. The monetization of our major deepwater development projects, the divestment of dry gas properties in Canada, and the focusing of our asset base in south Texas. These three things actions close during the quarter yielding $1.8 billion of cash proceeds. This brings the total cash proceeds generate before portfolio focusing steps over the last year to $10 billion. As Steve mentioned, we continue to actively repurchase Apache common shares during the quarter. In the second quarter we bought back $780 million in stock. To put that number in context I should note that the $1.4 billion proceeds from our deepwater divestment were only received on the very last day of the quarter, 30th of June. Our balance sheet remained strong, our total cash position as of June 30 is nearly $1.9 billion. Debt remains unchanged at $9 billion which puts us at 22% debt to cap. Now I’m going to make some comments regarding your expectations for the remainder of the year, starting with production. As Steve said, we remain on track to deliver our production growth expectations for the year, consistent with our 15% to 18% North American onshore liquids growth expectations, and the third and fourth quarters we anticipate 2% to 4% sequential North American onshore liquids growth, driven by our horizontal development, programs continuing to build on their momentum. In line with our 5% to 8% global BOE production growth, we anticipate our global gas production to drop 1% to 2% sequentially in the third quarter. And for global BOE production to be flat to 1% up sequentially for the quarter. This is driven primarily by our regularly scheduled third quarter maintenance turnaround in the North Sea, where production is expected to be 12% to 14% down sequentially in the third quarter with that production returning in the fourth quarter. As a final production note we currently expect Australia production to rise 6,000 to 8,000 BOEs per day sequentially in each of the third and fourth quarters, driven by oil from Balnaves ramping up. Going to turn now to realizations. We currently expect North American oil realization discounts to WTI of $5 to $8 barrel. On the international oil side we expect to shift to a realization discount to Brent of $1 to $2 per barrel as our mix of production evolves with Australia ramping up. We continue to expect North American natural gas realization discounts to NYMEX for the full year in line with first quarter or a $0.40 per Mcf discount. And we now see global NGL realizations at 28% to 30% of WTI for the remainder of the year, which is slightly lower than our previous expectation, driven by North America now being expected to be at 25% to 27% of WTI. Now I'm going to move to the expense side. Starting with LOE. Second quarter unit LOE was up sequentially to $10.59, this is in line with expectations we set out in our previous call, of an increase form first quarter levels by 10% through year-end, driven by the ongoing shift in our portfolio balance and general cost increases. Going now to DD & A, unit recurring DD & A was up $0.70 sequentially in the second quarter. This is in line with our expectations to see it rise this year by as much $2 per BOE from first quarter numbers, as we focus our capital on liquids projects. Going to taxes other than income, we expect an increase for the remainder of the year primarily driven by the initiation of Australia PRRT expense. Based on current strip prices, we currently expect taxes other than income to increase sequentially by $40 million to $70 million in the third quarter. Going to G&A, second quarter G&A expense reflected the timing of third-party reimbursements, we expect a sequential increase of $20 million to $40 million in G&A expense in the third quarter. And finally, on the Income Statement, going to income taxes, our adjusted income tax rate was 40.3% in the second quarter, which is in line with our expectations of 40% to 44% for the year. On an adjusted basis, our deferred tax percentage was 30% which is broadly in line with our previously stated expectations for the year. Finally, capital for the first half of 2014 was in line with our plan for the year. We have updated the format of our capital table on Page 10 of financial supplement to facilitate the tracking of our investment. This concludes our prepared remarks. I think we’re now ready for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Please note that during the Q&A portion of the call, you are allotted one question and one follow-up question. Please hold for the first question. First question will come from Bob Bracket with Sanford Bernstein.
Robert Brackett – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Hi, good afternoon. Question on this international asset separation, and it has two parts. In terms of Egypt, does the JV partner have any preemption rights or any ability to restrict what you might do there? And the second is you talk about North America growth as opposed to U.S. growth. What’s the role of Canada in the portfolio, and is it a target for the international asset separation?
G. Steven Farris: Well, let’s start with the international certainly the way that we are looking at it, we would just spend out or set up a company that was not was above any of the relationships Apache had at the joint venture level. So that would not require votes of other parties. With respect to Canada, we have said for some time that Canada was a part of our North American onshore portfolio, certainly we have two businesses up there. I think we have a business which is a big business that we have with respect to Duvernay Shale, the Montney Shale and some of the other things that we are working on there and then we also have Kitimat, Horn River, Leard. Kitimat, Horn River, Leard is part of our LNG projects that we indicated and re-indicated today that we intend to exit.
Robert Brackett – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: And then a follow-up on the East Texas Eagle Ford, if you’re ramping the 10 rigs, does that you’ve de-risked it and this is a commercial project that competes for capital. 
G. Steven Farris:  We feel very comfortable we’d de-risk and it also is going to compete with capital and today what we are trying to do is refine it and it increase the rate of return and the EURs and lower the cost.
Robert Brackett – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Great, thanks.
Operator: The next question will come from Michael Roe with PPH.
Michael Roe – PPH:  Yes, good afternoon. I just had a quick question on the central region. So I know you all picked up some rigs in Q2 to try to catch up based on your slowdown in Q1. So I was wondering when you’re decelerating in that region this year, are there particular zones that we will see less capital relative to others?
John J. Christmann, IV: This is John. Yes, I mean we are planning to drop some rigs and slowdown and retool in the central region so we will dropping some capital back half of the year.
G. Steven Farris: I apologize because you were very almost inaudible on this end but – right now we got two parts of the central region, we got the Anadarko Basin, which we are going to drop some rigs on and we also got the Canyon Lime down in Texas Panhandle, we are going to be increasing but net-net we’ll be reducing our capital in the overall program for the central region.
Michael Roe – PPH:  Okay, yes, so my question didn’t come through clearly, I was just curious, if there is any specific zone in the Anadarko Basin that will see less capital unlike is it the Cleveland or the Granite Wash, they will see less capital or will it just be kind of uniform across the board.
G. Steven Farris: In general, we still remained very bullish or excited about the basin we just need to slowdown and we’ve had good wells in all those zones. We just need to kind slowdown take a deep breath and pause and regroup. 
Michael Roe – PPH: Okay, great, and then I guess just shifting really quick to the Permian Basin, looks like the well results you all had in the Bone Spring look pretty strong in the Pecos Bend area. I was wondering if you could help provide color on how much acreage you have in Reeves, Loving and Ward Counties of the Delaware Basin? Just trying to get a sense of your running room there.
John J. Christmann, IV:  When you look at our Delaware basin acreage we’ve got over 500,000 gross for that 215,000 net. So we’ve got good running room in all three of those counties. But I don’t have a break down specifically just to those three. But that is how you kind of look at the whole Delaware basin.
Michael Roe – PPH: Okay, thanks for the color.
Operator: The next question will come from David Tameron with Wells Fargo. David your line is open. Can you hear me your line is open. 
Castlen Kennedy: You can go ahead and move to the next question, please.
Operator: The next question will come from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Co.
Pearce W. Hammond – Simmons & Co.:  Hi, good afternoon guys.
G. Steven Farris: Good afternoon.
Pearce W. Hammond – Simmons & Co.:  Regarding potential international divestitures, how do you balance the need to simplify the company and placate some shareholders in the near term versus the challenges of receiving fair value for those international assets and what is best for the company in the long-term. 
G. Steven Farris: Well I think number one if you look at what we’ve done over the last five years and what we’ve said today they are consistent we – in the past we haven’t said what we’re going to today, we thought like we – with all the discussion out there we felt like we had to discuss some of this. With respect to what we have sold in the past and the way I feel about the future is, I think we’ve have gotten very fair prices from what we have sold and frankly they are like Heidelberg and Lucius, we started selling that over a year and what we ended up selling it for, because we weren’t going to sell it at prices that don’t make sense. And that’s the way I feel about our international assets. But I do think there is a potential for a capital market solution for a number of these assets and we’re working on that, have been working on that for some time.
Pearce W. Hammond – Simmons & Co.: Thank you, Steve and then my follow up relates to Kitimat. Does the sale of Kitimat impact the value of the Leard and Horn River assets. Or do you – if you’re going to sell down your interest in Kitimat, do you in turn sell down the Leard and Horn River so that goes with that package and does it stay with the Canadian assets that might be at a part of your onshore North America go forward company?
G. Steven Farris: Yeah, I have to honestly say I don’t think the complete exit by Apache has a impact on the value of Kitimat going forward one way or the other. I said frankly whether we’re in it or not is a world class project with world class reserves and frankly Chevron and Apache at this point are a way head of anybody else in that arena. So, and we’ve always been in a position frankly that we felt like we could not be in these LNG projects. And I just think it’s important that we stayed back.
Pearce W. Hammond – Simmons & Co.: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: The next question will come from Joe Allman with JPMorgan.
Joseph David Allman – JPMorgan Securities LLC:  Thank you. In terms of Apache post these transactions, what’s your hope in terms of, say a growth rate, what do you think is an appropriate growth rate for a North America onshore focused Apache? What kind of growth rate would you think is competitive? How would you see spending, would you think you would be free cash flow positive, or free cash flow neutral, or would you accelerate and actually be deficit spending? And then also what kind of returns would you be looking forward in the post-transaction Apache?
G. Steven Farris: Well, I think if you look at, frankly if you look at what our growth rate is today, and you compare it with most of the companies of size, our long term forecast is 5% to 9%. Regardless of whether we say that is our forecast, that is competitive in the market, I think our liquids growth are competitive in the market at 15% to 18%. With respect, do we live within our cash flow? I think we have been very open over the last several quarters about what our view of our capital structure is. Our capital structure should be in a position that is competitive in the market, and gives us flexibility in the financial arena, so that’s all I’m going to comment about that. I think we have the potential frankly with the asset base that we have, and the expertise that we are building the capabilities for, frankly. Really have the potential to have significant growth over the next several years.
Joseph David Allman – JPMorgan Securities LLC:  Got you. And then a follow-up, so just a follow-up to that question, and then another one. So just in terms of returns, do you think that the post-Apache or the post-transaction Apache will yield better returns than the existing Apache? And then off question is, like what’s your thinking behind the sale of international and what kind of iterations have you thought about, have you thought about spinning out the Permian for example, or have you thought about spinning and selling everything except keeping Egypt and North Sea, which currently generate free cash flow, and also keeping the Permian, but selling everything else. So just trying to think about what iterations have you thought about, and what does selling international really do for you?
G. Steven Farris:  Well, we thought about a number of reiterations. I don’t know that I could mark off each one of the ones you went through in terms of the consideration. I see North American onshore sales as a different business than what we are doing internationally. They take different expertise, they take different time frames, they take different really scientific skill sets. And I think that it is important for us to recognize that, and recognize if we’re going to be the best we can be, we need to concentrate on the things that we have the most of, and I think has the highest – the greatest growth future.
Joseph David Allman – JPMorgan Securities LLC:  Got you. And just on returns do you think, you'll have higher returns post transaction or is there… 
G. Steven Farris:  Yes, I do. I think overall when you say returns, I’m talking about future returns on invested dollars. As we look at our discretionary spend going forward, where we can spend dollars for the highest rates of return. I think what we’re doing now, certainly in the Permian what we’re doing in Eagle Ford compete with anything else we’re doing investing across the Company. Certainly Egypt is a great rate of return, but we also got to recognize that it’s a situation that fits into international portfolio also.
Joseph David Allman – JPMorgan Securities LLC:  Got you. Very helpful. Steve, thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from John Herrlin with Societe Generale.
John Herrlin – Societe Generale:  Yes, hi. Two quick ones for me, Steve. What was the condensate yield out of the Duvernay well you mentioned?
G. Steven Farris: John, I’m sorry. I didn’t…
John J. Christmann, IV:  Yes, John. Hang on just a second here. On our Duverney well, the 734-barrels of oil a day, 200 barrels are condensate and about $4.4 million. Those are actually 30-day average.
John Herrlin – Societe Generale: Great. Thank you. With respect to the international spin, Steve, what about tax efficiency? Is it easier to do a spin versus an outright sale? How could you shield your basis for a lot of the sales proceeds?
Alfonso Leon: John. Hi, it’s Alfonso. We have been working on this for quite sometime now. Based on our work to-date, we believe that we can effect the separation of our international business in a tax efficient manner. We still have obviously significant work ahead of us as we move this forward. So based on everything that we have seen thus far, we believe we can get this done efficiently?
John Herrlin – Societe Generale: Okay, great. Thank you, very much.
Operator:  The next question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Doug Leggate – Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Thanks everybody for getting me on. Steve, Egypt when you sold it last year, I think one of the arguments for keeping the two thirds that you retained was about, you may get a better option to see a recovery in the political environment there, and obviously you took a fairly hefty discount on it. I’m just curious therefore, is a separation via a spin preferred to trying to take cash out of Egypt, because obviously you'd end up suffering the same fate I imagine? And if so, would you be thinking an international listing for the international business or would you be thinking about two U.S. listed companies, I know it’s a bit conceptual, but just trying to get understanding how you’re thinking about it, I’ve got a follow-up, please?
G. Steven Farris:  Well, certainly if we do it in the capitals market, we spin it, certain of our shareholders will still own it. I mean, and they have the benefit of it. And maybe Alfonso, I didn’t understand the complete question frankly.
Alfonso Leon:  Hey, Doug. Look, we are looking at all alternatives, and that’s why we’ve outlined that we are evaluating a number of different alternatives. We need to get to the best possible outcome, the one that maximizes value for our shareholders. So we are progressing different alternatives. Now, when you look at the profile, the profitability the competitive position of our international businesses, they are each of them the leader in their respective competitive space. So obviously, they have a very attractive profile for a portfolio capital markets positioning. So that’s certainly a very compelling opportunity.
Doug Leggate – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So my follow-up, maybe it’s just for you, Alfonso, but the value of your onshore resources obviously going to be depended on the pace of drilling, and Wheatstone for sure, and certainly North Sea in each of – would have generated on both – currently generated substantial free cash flow. So how do we think about giving that up in terms of the ability to accelerate the onshore using that international free cash flow as you did separate businesses, and I’ll leave it at that. Thank you.
G. Steven Farris: Let me just start with respect to – you’re not really taking it away, let’s assume that we – if we were to divest of it, obviously, we’d also – we’d just bring in the value forward. If we do spin it, we also have debt associated with those assets that are spun out, so in either way you’re not giving up that assets, you’re just separating them.
Doug Leggate – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So Steve would we expect then to – Apache has always kind of talked about living within cash flow, so in that situation, are you seeing you reduce your balance sheet to accelerate the growing in the lower 48?
G. Steven Farris:  Well, I think what I’ve said, and I'll say it again, and because I said it earlier. We look at our financial position based on what we think is a competitive in the market, and also in such – in a position that we can continue to grow. We're in a different space than we were in when we were acquiring and exploiting. We're in a different space in terms of what our go-forward opportunities are. So how we look at our balance sheet is going to change a little bit.
Doug Leggate – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it, understood. Thanks very much fellows.
Operator: The next question will come from Brian Singer with Goldman, Sachs.
Brian Singer – Goldman, Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good afternoon. A question on the Permian. Relative to your Analyst Meeting in late February, what is evolving in your Permian strategy or assumptions, and how are you looking at potential and drilling opportunities in your central Midland Basin position in Midland, Martin and Howard Counties? 
John J. Christmann, IV:  Well, I mean what we laid out, we’re pretty much in line. We’ve run six to seven rigs at Barnhard. We’ve been taking those learnings and applying them. We’ve now got 18 rigs running horizontally in the Midland Basin. So we’re starting to announce some results in our Scottish rights and our pile area and so forth. So we’re taking those learnings that we’ve had in Barnhard. In general, though, we’re still working. I mean, when you look at what we’re doing right now on the completion side, we’re looking at more clusters, more stages, more sand loading per linear foot, all of those things and I think it’s helping wells holdup longer and so forth. So we continue to take those learnings that we’ve had and progress them into other areas as well as into the Eagle Ford and those things.
Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thanks. And then, what is the timing for a greater decision on the separation of the international assets? Is there a specific time you expect to have that, and does that decision need to be made prior to selling Wheatstone, Kitimat, or other international assets individually?
Alfonso Leon: Brian, we haven’t set a specific timeline. We are working on a number of different opportunities and have been working on them for quite some time at the moment. Each of them has a different timeline associated with it, and we will make decisions as we get to decision points. Specifically on the separation workflow, I’m sure you’re very familiar with, those are multi core processes. So that is not something that is executed on an imminent basis. The work has been underway, but there is still significant work ahead of us.
Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.
Michael Hall – Heikkinen Energy Advisors:  Thank you. A number of mine have been asked on the portfolio repositioning, so I’ll leave that be, but on the Permian, just a couple questions. The oil growth in the quarter kind of slowed a bit on a quarter on quarter basis. Anything in particular driving that, and is this kind of a timing issue or how should we think about that going forward?
John J. Christmann, IV: It’s clearly timing issue. We pulled a few pads forward into the first quarter. That’s why you had bigger first quarter numbers relative to second quarter. So it’s an issue on the timing and so forth. But we remain optimistic and encouraged with our asset base.
Michael Hall – Heikkinen Energy Advisors:  Okay. And I guess in that context, are there any surface constraints that you’re working through at present that might help restructure?
John J. Christmann, IV: We don’t have anything backed up right now. I mean, that’s the nice thing about our portfolio is we plan our schedule, we plan our completion timing, we stay ahead on the facilities. So that’s the big advantage we’ve got, which has really let us have such a track record, 17 out of 18 quarters up. So we remained executing the plan we’ve got out there.
Michael Hall – Heikkinen Energy Advisors: Great, and then just as a reminder, can you remind me what your protection on differentials looks like out of the Permian Basin and in the context the royalty revenues coming from the mineral ownership you have in the basin?
John J. Christmann, IV: In terms of our volumes we do have the ability to take Gulf Coast pricing or WTI or NYMEX. We’ve got protection on the differentials. We have not disclosed anything on our mineral royalties out there. We do have a nice position, but a lot of that is future acreage to be developed and it’s not something that’s contributing a great percentage right now.
Michael Hall – Heikkinen Energy Advisors: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles A. Meade – Johnson & Rice Company L.L.C.:  Good afternoon, everybody. I want to go back to the issue of the international assets. It seems to me that a lot of the conversation questions contain the assumption that all of the assets or the whole set of international operations will all go out in one transaction. I wanted to test that assumption a bit because it seems to me that some of the assets would have a better reception in the capital markets and then others maybe belong with you or belong in some other international company’s portfolio. So can you may be shed a little light on whether there’s going to be multiple transactions or just one?
Thomas E. Voytovich:  That’s a very good question. Honestly, we truthfully have been working on a number of opportunities. One is a complete capital market solution. But we also have other solutions that you point out that could take place and could take place quicker than a complete capital market’s exit. So, yes, it could be some combination of each one of those.
Charles A. Meade – Johnson & Rice Company L.L.C.:  Great, thank you, Tom. And then going back to the Permian, I know you guys have fielded a lot of questions on your royalty position in the last month or so. And I wonder if you could give anymore breakdown of maybe by Midland Basin, central Basin platform, Delaware Basin or by county on where those royalty acres lie.
John J. Christmann, IV:  They’re scattered. We’ve got a big position in the very, very southern portion of the Delaware is where a big chunk of it sits, which is really below where the activity has been, but we think it could ultimately move there. But that’s where a lion’s share of it sits. We’ve also got some gains, but nothing that we’ve lined out is in an area right now that we’re going crazy with on the development side.
Charles A. Meade – Johnson & Rice Company L.L.C.:  Got it. That’s helpful detail. Thank you, John.
Operator:  The next question will come from Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse.
Arun Jayaram – Credit Suisse:  Good afternoon. Alfonso, Steve, understanding you’re still evaluating the potential separation of international. It seems like the comments today suggest that you believe strategically a complete separation of the two makes the most sense. So, is that a fair characterization strategically?
G. Steven Farris:  I think it’s a fair characterization that they are – we recognize and we have recognized that there really are two different businesses and I think how we accomplish that recognition in the end will probably end up a majority of those assets being in another vehicle, if you understand what I’m saying. What that vehicle is if it’s a capital structure solution or for an outright sale.
Arun Jayaram – Credit Suisse: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thanks for clarifying that. Second question just goes along with the Anadarko Basin. Steve, this has been an area that I know you focused on post the Cordillera transaction. Can you just give us a little bit more detail on why the growth rate is coming in a little bit lower than you had thought initially?
G. Steven Farris: I think I’ll let John comment on the details. I think our biggest issue is, I think I’ve pointed out in my prepared remarks, we are 26% behind in terms of getting wells on compared with our plan. Regardless of the results of those wells, 26% is, and honestly the majority of those had some kind of mechanical issue either sidetrack, or casing, or completion problems. We just took our eye off the ball frankly and we got to get our eye back on the ball.
John J. Christmann, IV: And, Arun, just a little color there. We’re 43 wells short of what we plan to have on through the first half of the year, which is huge when you had a program of 163 for the plan. And then when you look at a lot of what’s lead to that we’ve had over 27 wells that sidetrack in. So when you look at that, I mean, that’s big, big portion of where we are. I will say we’ve had good results in all of the play. So we aren’t saying none of them are working. We’ve just got to kind of get refocused and get back to doing it how we approach, how we used to do it.
Arun Jayaram – Credit Suisse: Okay.
John J. Christmann, IV: And with new technology too.
Arun Jayaram – Credit Suisse: Okay. And then just my final quick question, you guys reiterated your volume guidance despite the timing in Australia at Coniston plus perhaps a slower growth rate from the central. Where is this going to be made up, Permian and East Texas?
John J. Christmann, IV: Your Permian, your East Texas, Eagle Ford as well as Bivens play, Canada remains ahead of schedule as well.
Arun Jayaram – Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you for that detail.
Operator: The next question will come from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers.
Jeffrey Campbell – Tuohy Brothers:  Good afternoon. I think I’ve got some, John, questions here. Can you give some color on the current DNC costs and the K-bob Duvernay and what you think these costs can look like over the next 18 months?
John J. Christmann, IV: Well, right now we’ve got two wells down and they were not done off of pads and so not really in a position to steer off of where we’ve been. As we work on the program this fall, we plan to spud six more Duvernay wells and I think we’ll see cost come down significantly. But our first couple wells were science wells. And, so they’re not representative of where we’ll be in the future with our program up there.
Jeffrey Campbell – Tuohy Brothers: The next question was the Hector County Kline well was a very strong result. Can you contrast the extra Kline from the Kline wells you’ve been drilling in the East and Glasscock? Are there any noteworthy differences in geology or mix or cost?
John J. Christmann, IV:  Well, just like the Midland Basin, you get a little bit deeper in the basin. So you get a little bit pressure or little different oil makeup. So that area, we’re very excited about. But geology is a little different and obviously the fluid property as well.
Jeffrey Campbell – Tuohy Brothers: Okay. If I can sneak one last one in. You said in the first quarter 2014 when you were talking about the East Texas Eagle Ford, you were targeting getting some wells up to 10,000 feet laterals. I was just wondering have you drilled any of that long yet? And can you disclose what the lateral lengths were of the two Reveille wells you highlighted in the second quarter supplement?
John J. Christmann, IV: Those Reveille wells have been in the 6,000 to 7,000 foot range and we have not drilled one up to 10,000. I think we had one about 8,000 was one earlier. So we do think we’ll be able to continue to drill longer laterals. A lot of that’s just driven by how we led the units down in the land position.
Jeffrey Campbell – Tuohy Brothers:  Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question will come from Leo Mariani with RBC. 
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: Just a question on the Kitimat disposal here. Can you talk a little bit more about the motivation for this? Is this based on the fact that it’s going to be a significant CapEx burden for a number of years for the company and you wouldn’t see any cash flow out many years? Is that one of the motivating factors behind the disposition? And given how that’s a very early stage project, would you expect to get a material amount of cash for that on the short-term?
John J. Christmann, IV:  Well, in terms of the decision process, obviously if you look at where we are going on our base business and you think about the priority of capital and the time frame associated with LNG projects and specifically Kitimat frankly, it makes sense for someone else to own it that has a different time horizon than we do. And in terms of the order of magnitude of the capital, cash, we’ll have to see.
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. That’s all I had. Thanks.
Operator: The next question will come from Richard Tullis with Capital One.
Richard Tullis – Capital One: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a couple quick questions. Steve, what were the average well costs in the second quarter for your Permian, Wolfcamp and Bone Spring wells?
G. Steven Farris: Our Wolfcamp wells have been running around $7 million roughly, which is kind of an average. One thing we’ve seen is we’ve gone with little harsh sand loadings, some have creeped up, $7 million is probably a pretty good number and our Bone Spring wells have come down a little bit and they’re probably in that same range. 
Richard Tullis – Capital One: Okay. Given this, what could be even in more focused onshore North America assets than say at the time of the Analyst Meeting, how does the Gulf of Mexico shelf fit into that portfolio? Would you still plan to be active there in 2015/2016?
Thomas E. Voytovich: This is Tom. Gulf shelf remains an area of focus for us, but we are in an inventory building mode now. There’s no capital committed for 2014. We would anticipate some expenditures in 2015 provided of course that that opportunity is competitive with other things in the portfolio.  I will say that inventory building is well underway. We have pretty impressive list of prospects. And I will also say though that there’s no pressure to execute on these right now. The only decision making component here is whether or not these prospects are competitive with what we’re doing in North America onshore. And if they are, they’ll get consideration for capital.
Richard Tullis – Capital One: Okay. And then just lastly, how much has been spent to date on Kitimat on a net basis?
Thomas E. Voytovich: I think IR will have to come back to you on that number.
Richard Tullis – Capital One: Okay that’s fine.
Thomas E. Voytovich: I don't have that number yet.
Richard Tullis – Capital One: All right. Thank you. I appreciate it.
Operator: The final question will come from Joe Magner with Macquarie
Joseph Patrick Magner – Macquarie Capital Inc.: Thanks for getting me on here. Just want to go back to the portfolio of repositioning topic here for a bit. I guess I'm still not clear on what actually is driving the moves now, what's driven the recognition that the domestic business or the North American business is different and should be separate from the international and LNG businesses. And it's only a few months ago that you all had laid out sort of the longer term view with all of the moves that it made last year and there was a lot of hope that perhaps that work was behind you. And now we've got one, two potentially a number of additional transactions to be on the look out for over the coming quarters. What really, I mean aside from the recent announcements about some increased interest from some potential shareholders, some certain shareholders, I guess that's what I'm trying to get a better handle on. It seem like you were comfortable and had made comments in the past, but the moves that have been made were the moves that you had in sort of in mind and thought that was going to be enough. And now we've got another change here, so could spend a little more time on that?
G. Steven Farris: Certainly. Let me start off with talking about from late 2009. And I thank most of our shareholders and (indiscernible) most have that chart because what I showed is that we made a strategic decision to get back into North America. And if you look at what we did over that timeframe, I think, we brought $16 billion worth of properties and 85% of were with North America onshore. And if you look at about what we were about after 2012, first part of 2013, I think at our year-end analyst call we said we were going to sell $1 billion worth of properties at that time. In the second quarter we came out and announced we were going to sell $4 billion worth of properties and end up now of selling $10 billion worth of properties. I think the overriding thing that we take from this is that number one; we started out being on the forefront of coming back to North America. And I think what you’re seeing is, what does it take to get North America onshore to center part of this company? And if you look at what we’ve been able to do, it's getting us a long way there. If you look at what we got in front of us in terms of these LNG projects and the long term nature of them, the amount of capital it takes to invest in them. I think that’s an easy decision. I think the difference what we come to the conclusion of frankly in our North American versus international is they are two different businesses, and if you look at the way that you go about doing them in workflows, et cetera, they are two different businesses. So, in our opinion it makes sense that we continue to reduce the size of our international assets because we made a decision long time ago, we’re going to be North American onshore. So that’s, honestly that is and we’ve had some recent discussion about that, among lots of folks and I think it’s important that we state our case and that is our case.
Joseph Patrick Magner – Macquarie Capital Inc.: Okay, we will stay tuned for additional updates, thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
Castlen Kennedy: Great thank you so much. We appreciate you all participating in our call today and as always feel free to reach out to IR with follow-up questions. Thank you all and have a great day.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brady Parish, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.
Castlen Kennedy: Thank you, Jennifer. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation’s first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. On today’s call, we will have three speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. I will start by giving a brief summary of results and then we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; followed by Alfonso Leon, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, joining us for the question-and-answer session are John Christmann, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of North America; and Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer of International. We prepared our quarterly financial supplemental data package for your use, which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss, such as adjusted earnings, or cash flow from operations. In addition, we have prepared an operations supplement which summarizes our activities and includes detailed well highlights across the various Apache operating regions. These can both be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financialinfo. Today’s discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website. This morning we reported first quarter 2014 earnings from continuing operations of $753 million or $1.90 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results totaled $707 million or $1.78 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital totaled $2.2 billion during the quarter. During the first quarter, total reported net production averaged approximately 640,000 boe per day with liquids production constituting 58% of the total. Production during the first quarter was impacted by the sale of our operations in Argentina which closed March flow and were shown as discontinued operations on the income statement. Including discontinued operations from Argentina, our total production for the quarter was 672,000 boe per day. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Farris: Good afternoon everyone and thank all of you for joining this afternoon. As you know, Apache has taken some significant steps to rebalance our portfolio and to focus our strategy on predictable production growth among North American onshore assets which are fuelled by our substantial cash flow that we generate from our international operation. As we reshape our portfolio for the last four years, we’ve now shifted our focus to execution which has been a long core strength of Apache for a number of years. As Castlen pointed out, today we announced strong first quarter results generating $707 million of adjusted earnings, and $2.2 billion of cash flow from operation before changes in working capital. During the quarter, as Castlen pointed out, we experienced weather impacts in the North Sea as well as our central region where weather not only impacted our production but it also impacted our delay in our drilling schedule. Despite these significant disruptions, our first quarter production numbers were ahead of our internal plan. We remain on track to deliver within our previously stated production guidance for the year at 15% to 18% North American onshore liquids growth, and 5% to 8% global boe growth on our pro forma 2013 production of 537,000 barrels per day. During the quarter, our operational focus in our [indiscernible] acreage position across the number of hydrocarbon rich basins, allowed us to drive production growth in North American onshore liquids where we averaged 198,484 barrels per day which is up 6% or 11,600 barrels per day over the fourth quarter. North America onshore liquids represented 53% of our total worldwide liquids and 31% of our total overall production. You can read a number of details in our operational performance and the quarterly operations supplement. I am going to go over a few of the highlights. In the Permian, we got off to a strong start to the year, with production increasing nearly 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day or 12% quarter over quarter. This growth was a result of our continued strong performance relative to our tight curve and the ability to move some of our well forward. We continued to have exceptional results on the Wolfcamp where we drilled an additional $43 horizontal wells during the quarter and further delineating our potential in the southern Midland basin where we averaged 7 rigs .We also saw significant results in our Bone Springs play in the Delaware basin. In our Gulf Coast region we saw some very encouraging results from our Eagle Ford acreage. Earlier this year at our investor day we outlined our 400,000 gross acreage position in the northern part of this play. We’re continuing to progress on stranding [ph] of the area despite nine additional wells during the quarter, our most recently completed well was McCullough-Wineman in Brazos county which 30- day IP averaged 1,455 barrels of oil equivalent a day well above our initial type curve. Based on this recent well result, and our overall understanding of the play, we plan to increase our rig count from four currently to eight by midyear. In the division we’re driving costs down in the play and are currently working to reconfigure our wells to further enhance our returns. In Canada, quarter-over-quarter we grew liquids production by 10%. We experienced strong growing results in our new liquids rich area of the Duvernay and Montney. We have 3D wells with encouraging results but we don’t plan to disclose further details at this time. Earlier this week we disclosed two recent field discoveries in Egypt, including a well in Matruh basin and Khalda Offset Concession which encountered pay in five separate formations and tested at combined rate of 49 million a day and 7,700 barrels of condensates per day. As you know we rigorously review our opportunity set and allocation of capital on a quarterly basis. Based on the strong results we’ve seen in the Permian so far and the Eagle Ford and our Gulf Coast regions we are evaluating the programs with an eye towards reallocating capital for those regions. Looking ahead to production for the rest of the year, we anticipate strong second half growth as projects come on line in Australia and North Sea, a bit recovery from a very difficult winter. Let’s turn now from operations to our continuing efforts to fine tune our overall portfolio. During the quarter we announced several additional divestments, in March we closed our previously announced sale of our operations in Argentina. In addition we announced the sale of non-core assets in Canada from Noel, Wapiti, and Ojay which did close on April 30. I am sure you saw this morning we announced the sale of our deepwater projects Lucius and Heidelberg and 11 primary term exploration blocks to Freeport-McMoRan for $1.4 million. We have retained all current production in deepwater as well as the 147 deepwater primary blocks. Based on the operator’s current timeline for the estimated production contribution for Lucius, we’re foregoing about 0.4% or approximately 2000 barrels of oil per day at gross for the year – both of this transaction. As I previously mentioned we remain confident in achieving our 2014 growth guidance. I also want to provide an update on the progress related to our two LNG projects Wheatstone and Kitimat. We are in advanced discussions and on track to decide on the most appropriate financing options in the near future and at Kitimat we have been working with our partner to reduce our 2014 capital spend given where we are in the project lifetime. Currently we anticipate reducing the budget by approximately 40% to around $600 million net as you recall that’s down from an initial budget net (indiscernible). Also at Kitimat, we are currently in discussion with several interested parties as we look to right size the overall investment in this project. This is an ongoing process and one that we are focused on getting done in this calendar year. Finally I want to provide an update on our buyback program. Utilizing proceeds primarily from divestments during the quarter as we bought back an additional $485 million of stock, this brings our total, since the launch of the buyback program to the end of the first quarter to nearly $1.5 billion or 17 million shares. As a reminder our board authorized 30 million shares buyback program in early 2013 and we’re continuing to believe that Apache shares are a compelling investment at this price. But on the first quarter conference call last year that we initially outlined our plans to redefine our global portfolio and bring greater focus to our expanded North American onshore asset base. We’ve made significant progress over this past year. We emerged a leaner, a more North American onshore physical company. We believe our current portfolio gives Apache a tremendous foundation with sustained, predictable, repeatable and profitable growth for the foreseeable future. I would like to turn it over to Alfonso Leon.
Alfonso Leon: Thanks, Steve. I am going to cover three areas today. Our balance sheet, reporting matters and earnings performance. As Steve indicated we continue to take important steps in pushing our portfolio for profitable growth. Within the first four months of the year we announced and completed the sale of our entire operation in Argentina and certain dry gas properties in Canada. Today’s announcement of the monetization of our development stage projects at Lucius and Heidelberg represents yet another step forward in focusing us in our growth area while crystallizing value for shareholders. We continue to actively repurchase Apache’s common shares. During the first quarter we bought back $485 million in stock bringing our total re-purchase in initiating our $2 billion buyback program last year to $1.5 billion through the end of the first quarter. We continue to view our shares as one of the most attractive options to capture cash flow, reserve value and portfolio debt. We recently allocated an additional $300 million of cash availability through incremental buybacks and now has a further near term optionality on this front with funds from Lucius and Heidelberg transactions. Of course, our balance sheet remains very strong and supports our deep opportunities for organic value growth. We ended the first quarter with $1.6 billion of cash and debt unchanged at $9.7 billion which puts us at 22% debt to cap. We have approximately $1.8 billion in new proceeds from our Canada and deepwater transactions coming our way now and we expect our E&P capital expenditure to be within our cash flow for the year. So our financial position is really very strong. Now, there are two balance sheet items in front of us. First is managing our interest in two integrated LNG projects for maximum shareholder value growth. Steve discussed this briefly but given the importance of this issue I want to touch on them as well. We have identified competitive alternatives to finance our remaining investment in Wheatstone LNG outside of our cash flow and expect to announce our decision over the next few months. In regard to Kitimat LNG, since our analyst day in February we have been working with our partner to reduce the proposed investment in 2014 by 40% to $600 million net to Apache. In addition we are in discussions with other potential partners to right size Apache’s percentage interest in the project. Kitimat is one of the most strategic projects underway in the global energy industry. It will open Canada’s gas exports to Asia. Kitimat has real pipeline solution in place, is backed by an unprecedented 100 TCFs of supply in the highest quality gas shale in Bakken in North America and can be delivered from the Art Well Pass [ph] producing up to 1 TCF each with minimal environmental impact. It’s a good project. What we must do is right size Apache’s participation and states the investment to build long term value while supporting our competitive per share performance today. The second balance sheet item to keep in mind is that most of our current cash is overseas and cannot come back to United States without tax consequences. This is the common issue for global corporations like Apace and yet one more reason why our monetization step announced today with Lucius and Heidelberg is important. This is U.S cash for Apache. Moving to financial reporting. In our first quarter earnings, our former business in Argentina is reported as discontinued operations under accounting rules for current and historical period. This is the only component of our nearly $10 billion of recent portfolio focusing steps that you will see reflected as discontinued operation and that is strictly a function of GAAP rule. [indiscernible] is based on continuing operation on the total I stated. A financial supplement posted on our website provides additional details regarding Argentina operation. I am now going to turn to results. Our performance for the quarter was driven by strong production and price realization and resulted in reported earnings from continuing operations of $753 million or $1.90 per share. Our results included a couple of non-cash items, including an unrealized after tax gain on our derivatives of $49 million and some deferred tax impact. When we remove these non-cash items for comparability purposes, our adjusted earnings were $707 million from continuing operations or $1.78 per share, up from $610 million or $1.52 in the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow was strong driven by the performance of our North American onshore base, we generated $2.2 billion of cash flow from operations before working capital items, up from $2 billion in the fourth quarter. Now I would like to provide a bit of line by line color on our financial expectations through the end of the year. Let me start with production. In February, we outlined 2013 performance production of 537,000 barrels equivalent per day. These represent before a gas production for 2013 minus all the divested properties, the each of non-controlling interest in Egypt tax barrels [ph]. This 2013 number provides the baseline for comparability. As outlined in detail in Page 4 of our operations supplement, the equivalent underlying production in the first quarter of 2014 was 548,000 barrels equivalent per day. We performed ahead of our expectations through the first quarter and remain on track to achieve our guidance for the year and in spite of the loss of production growth from Lucius and the weather impact in our central and northeast regions in the first quarter. Turning to realization, oil realizations averaged approximately $101 per barrel for the first quarter. Based on the current market outlook for differentials, we see our first quarter North American realization discount to WTI of $4.60 widening in the second quarter by approximately $2 or $3 and then falling back to first quarter levels by the end of the year. We see international oil and North America gas realizations at about the first quarter discount to benchmarks for remainder of the year. On NGLs, we currently expect to realize about 30% of WTI through 2014. Going to the expense side, LOE per boe was up a bit quarter over quarter to $10.37. We expect this for boe cost to increase 10% driven by general increases in labor and power costs and our divestments of dry gas properties for the rest of the year. DD&A per boe is expected to rise by as much as $2 by the end of the year driven by our capital focus in liquids projects, although this is subject to significant variability spending on timing of reserve bookings. We broadly see other per unit cost metrics relatively stable through the rest of the year from the first quarter levels. On income taxes, our first quarter effective tax rate was 40.4%. Going forward we expect our effective tax rate for the rest of the year to be in the range of 40% to 44%. Our deferred tax percentage in the first quarter was 28% in line with what we would expect for the remainder of 2014 absent nonrecurring items. Finally, through the end of the first quarter, our E&P capital is on track with our planning for the year. Overall and despite significant weather events it was a very strong quarter for Apache and we reported strong production results, earnings and cash flow. This concludes our prepared remarks. And I think we are now ready for any questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Co.
Pearce Hammond – Simmons & Co.: Regarding capital allocation within the portfolio, does it make sense to dial back activity a little bit in the central region and redirect those dollars to higher rate of return plays like the Permian or Canada et cetera? I'm not sure if you were kind of touching on that a little bit in your prepared remarks at all, Steve.
Steve Farris: Yes, we haven’t made a final decision but I would suspect with the results that we’ve gotten out of the Eagle Ford, and some of the really better results in our type curve in the Permian basin, you could see us allocate capital a little differently than we did going into the year.
Pearce Hammond – Simmons & Co.: And would that the a decision that's more made at midyear?
Steve Farris: Probably a decision will be made in the next couple of weeks, I would say.
Pearce Hammond – Simmons & Co.: And then my follow-up is, given your tremendous success in growing volumes in the Permian, are you getting close to reaching a max operational limit for Apache and the region as it pertains to people, rig availability, procuring need of services, et cetera?
Steve Farris: With respect to services and rigs, we’re in very good shape, frankly. One good thing about having [indiscernible] rigs running that we have is we can’t get rigs and frac those. Certainly I made this analogy before, it’s a little bit like when you have a four month for 16 [ph], and you can add one more – it’s 16, you’ve got to add another 4. We can go up some, but we are not going to be able to go up some the way we’re going at from 2011 to 2012 and from 2012 to 2013. But we have made [ph] in that account.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.
John Freeman – Raymond James: Alfonso, just following up on what you said about Wheatstone where you're looking at these competitive financing alternatives. I mean can you just kind of give us some ideas of what those alternatives are?
Alfonso Leon: We need to get some decisions going our side but the basic principle is this is not going to come out of our cash flow, this is not going to come out of our existing assets. Where this is a project that is contracted and a project that can finance itself, so that we don’t have to make any incremental investment in this project. And it can also be something that we’re obviously looking Q4 value, we’re going to do whatever adds in those value for our shareholders –
John Freeman – Raymond James: And then other question, shifting gears on the central region when you discussed that the weather not only impacted your production, but also the drilling and completion schedule. Just for context, you drilled 44 net wells during the quarter. How many did you originally budget that you were going to drill and complete in the central region?
Steve Farris: John Christmann who runs our North American company you got --
John Christmann: Yes, we had originally planned and kind of outlined at the February analyst day 418 plus which is about 100 wells a quarter. So it’s a significant reduction in terms of what we were able to get on.
Steve Farris: That is really a result of jut the backup testing when you have – we had two different weather at those and it really weathers the production as much as being able to get wells down and frac and volume production.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Charles Meade of Johnson Rice.
Charles Meade – Johnson Rice: I wanted to ask the other press release -- the other news that you guys have been talking about today is the sell or the sale rather of Lucius and Heidelberg. And I wondered if you can -- you made reference in that press release that you're continuing to pursue the sale of other prospects I believe was the word. So I wondered if you could just give a bit of the narrative back story on how the sale came about. Whether it was someone who came and knocked on your door, whether you guys had the for sale sign on those for a while given the mark that Anadarko put on them?
Steve Farris: Well if you recall back in the beginning of 2013 even our yearend earnings call, we started unveiling what really had been planned for sometime but unveiling our goal to rebalance our North American portfolio make it a bigger chunk of it and we identified a number of assets internally that we were going to be on that risk, actually the deepwater was on that list at that time. The one thing I would tell you is that we made the conscious decision we would not sell any properties that we didn’t think that we got a fair value for. So that probably answers that question. It hasn’t been actively marketed but it has been in the market for sometime.
Charles Meade – Johnson Rice: That does. And I wonder if I could turn to the Permian here. When I look at your operations report and I see that you look like you've had some of the best results you guys have had in the Wolfcamp. In northern Reagan and in Upton County I know that's a little bit different from where the bulk of your area -- bulk of your activity was in 2013. So maybe this is best for John, is that a fair read on the quarterly results out in the Permian? And what's got you excited now?
John Christmann: I mean I think we continue to see improvement on all our wells, driven by completions, the things we are doing but we did run six rigs in the Mariam county, we may not track there, and continue to have outstanding results there. We have added 5 horizontal rigs that we started adding late last year and kind of started to hit our strides in most other counties, Midland, Upton and Reagan, so we’ve got 5 rigs running there, two verticals, you will start to see some of those kick in. The thing about Wolfcamp is you’ve got multiple beaches and we’re still early in understanding exactly how many wells we can drill per section, how many laterals and that sort of thing. So I am excited about all of it – our whole portfolio in the Permian is we’re having great results not just in Wolfcamp. So it’s not about the whole but –
Steve Farris: I might add, when John mentioned the number of wells per section, that number is not going to go down, that number is going to go up because we have identified that we may be able to downspace more than we are currently and we may have more batch of horizontals being able to go out, so the reverse per section certainly in that Wolfcamp area is not just in Barnett, but all through that play, we could see significant upwards.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Roe with PPH.
Michael Roe – PPH: I was just wondering you mentioned earlier in your prepared comments that you're seeing on the LOE side a 10% increase in general increase in labor and power costs, for the rest of the year. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color around that please?
Alfonso Leon: If you look across the industry and even if you look at the variance on our first quarter versus fourth quarter LOE per boe, those are the driving factors in terms of forward experience with the level of activity out there. Those are the two biggest drivers of our variance on a going forward basis within this year.
Michael Roe – PPH: And then I guess just my follow-up question would be it sounds like you're planning on using the cash from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico sale for additional share buybacks. I'm just wondering is there anything else you were contemplating for that or just how you're thinking about allocating that cash flow infusion. Thank you.
Alfonso Leon: We are going to a board meeting next week and that’s the discussion that we still need to have internally. Just announced the transaction today, so we have to go through that. But we are very conscious obviously the value of opportunities that we are crystallizing right now through our buybacks in front of us.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Malone with Mizuho Securities.
John Malone – Mizuho Securities: Just looking at Kitimat. Clearly it's been a drawn out process getting a partner. You've seen some potential partners go with competing projects. Is there anything you can say Steve about any differences in perception that you might have of potential partners, since it's late and just a longer process? Maybe on pricing or cost or environmental question in BC and can you talk just a little bit about the landscape in Asia LNG in general?
Alfonso Leon: In terms of our partner strategy, we brought Chevron into the project just last year and that was in ’13. We have been pursuing a very deliberate one step at the time of pros that brings value to this project – bringing Chevron in last year in 2013 was the very value added for us, it’s a downstream operator to complement our upstream expertise at Apache. At this point as this project gathers further momentum, we have decided it is the right time to bring in additional partner into our group, if anything the momentum of the project had accelerated beyond our expectations, the pipeline is in very good stage, the facility is in a very good stage and Chevron is very keen and start to head with this project. So it’s just the right time for Apache now to bring in another partner as we think about how much we had, and what project within our portfolio to maintain our balance.
John Malone – Mizuho Securities: And just Alfonso, just one analogy as well some housekeeping. You haven't spent anything from a general cash flow in Wheatstone to date? Is that correct?
Alfonso Leon: We have incurred capital expenditure year to date in the Wheatstone project. We have not affected our financing decision as it fits very welded and up until the date, within this year and which we implement that in anything transaction, we will be funding that capital expenditure either by all means.
John Malone – Mizuho Securities: And one last one for me just on the North Sea, can you give me a sense of what you think the run rate could be there, net of any weather affects? I know you've got new wells coming on in hopefully the 40s in barrel how will that compare to or offset the natural declines?
John Christmann: Well, as you are well aware, our strategy going into the year was that we were going to have growth regions and cash flow, so we measured the investment in the North Sea essentially deep flat. So we expect to meet that end of the year, I think that catch up from the weather event in the first quarter was already underway, and I would look for you to see that the production rate stabilized, where it was probably about in the fourth quarter.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of Credit Suisse.
Arun Jayaram – Credit Suisse: John, maybe starting with you. I was wanting to see if you could comment on how some of your initial well results have been doing on the horizontal side and the Delaware Basin?
John Christmann: We’ve got 3 rigs running over that whole area, and we have been very pleased, I mean we are predominantly growing in Bone Springs, and in Wolfcamp. And I think there is a couple volumes to be listed in the ops report and we are very pleased over there. We do have some acreage to the south that we are evaluating, and later in the year we will be looking at some of those areas but if I am looking the page 1, 1H and number 02H, both net, they’re still playing on the 30 day IP, they came out over a thousand boe per day. And over 12 rigs and high pressures.
Arun Jayaram – Credit Suisse: John, if you're going to put some incremental capital as it stands today, would you be looking more on the Midland side or the Delaware side?
John Christmann: Right now we are probably running two-thirds of rigs running in Midland, that’s the easiest place to add, and that’s driven based on just where we can put in immediately. I think the economics are very comparable in both basin though – as the year unfolds, mostly it’s getting more active in the Delaware.
Arun Jayaram – Credit Suisse: My second question is, Steve, you reiterated your North American onshore liquids guidance. Obviously the Permian is ahead of plan as we stand today. Do you expect the central region to be able to make up some of the weather induced downtime they had in the first quarter?
Steve Farris: I think it will make it up, some of it, I also think that we have opportunity set for day in the Eagle Ford and starting off the year based on what we have learned over the – really the last four months, we have an opportunity to ramp that up. I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we’re going to go to from four rigs to by the middle of the year to 8 rigs there – plenty of upside [ph] on that to be able to do that.
Arun Jayaram – Credit Suisse: And my final question is for Alfonso. The CapEx number in the quarter came in a little bit of above, at least what I was modeling. Just wanted to see if you could give us a sense of -- your full-year CapEx at the analyst day for your E&P was I believe a $8.5 billion, how you're trending relative to that target.
Alfonso Leon: We’re exactly on plan, it’s actually slightly under in some regions but all in all on plan for that target. When you look at the table in our supplemental financial disclosures I think there might be a bit confusion out there, when people are looking at those numbers and thinking about the 8.5, the numbers on that table include LNG CapEx within the relevant countries, that’s something that we are going to look at for us coming quarters except – to provide better clarity so the people can actually see how we find those to the 8.5. You also have Argentina in there and you also have to keep in mind that, that table includes Egypt on a 100% basis, so it does now have our two-third interest economics interest in Egypt [indiscernible] in the 8.5. So we’re going to work to make that a little bit clear for the next quarter but we are on plan with our CapEx.
Steve Farris: I want to reiterate what Alfonso said, you have a 100% capital – in that line you have 100% capital for Egypt, and our equity interest is two thirds. So it takes a little work to get to the net numbers. So overall --
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Eric Otto with CLSA Americas.
Eric Otto – CLSA Americas: Just a follow-up on Kitimat. Can you give us an update or color on discussions with customers? And related to that does your partner still require oil link pricing for them to move forward with FID?
Steve Farris: I think starting with customers, the one thing I would say is that it’s a very active marketing group right now. We are – we have had discussions with most everyone you would expect that you would market LNG to and those discussions we are ongoing. With respect to oil price, I think as a group, has been our partner, pretty good realization that it really doesn’t matter how you make up that basket but you really have to bear – at a price at the end of the pipe that will make up an economic project with the project, and I think we are both on the same page there.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale.
John Herrlin – Societe Generale: Kitimat, is it easier having FID to seek partners or does it matter at all in terms of bringing someone in?
Steve Farris: John, I don’t – I think Alfonso put a pretty good focus on – we are moving the project forward and we have a lot of momentum right now, I think that’s being hopefully recognized on the market side and in terms of FID, we would expect – we still have – final to do on the downstream, on the upstream it’s not just about – all about just drilling wells, we got an awful of facilities with takeaways planned success – we are in pipelines that we have put in there. So we are involved in that FID right now, that FID should be done – upstream should be done by the middle of 2015 and likewise in terms of where Chevron is on the other side. But they are not contingent on each other let me put it that way.
John Herrlin – Societe Generale: One for John Christmann. We're hearing a lot more about changing well designs and multiple launch for unconventional plays. Also the use of more ceramics. Are you changing your well completions designs at all in the Permian?
John Christmann: We showed a slide at analyst day that showed early results relative to the new changes we have made. I think as we get in and drill more of these wells, and better understand the source that we are dealing in, and the spacing and the – we are getting better and you are seeing more sands, more stages, more zones, and finding ways to place it properly. So it’s a combination of a lot of things.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy.
Michael Hall – Heikkinen Energy: I'm just curious on the good result you've been seeing there in the Eagle Ford, what are the hydrocarbon mix splits on those wells? And do you think you're stimulating the chalk at all with those? And what are the cost running on them?
Steve Farris: With respect to the mix, that well I mentioned made about 730 barrels for condensate for the rest of the year. So it’s about 60:40 liquids to gas. With respect to cost, I don’t know – well costs, -- we’ve just redesigned our Eagle Ford wells, we think we can take about $1.2 million off the well design that we’ve got right now. I am hopeful we can take more than that out of it. As you go into pad drilling and you go into manufacturing mode, you can really bring your cost down, we have shown that at Bernhard [ph] area, we’ve seen that honestly – we start off drilling wells $16 million and today they are under 7. So we expect those costs to come down significantly.
Michael Hall – Heikkinen Energy: And then you highlighted in the commentary or on the balance sheet all the cash that's sitting in the international arena. Any plans to do -- what are your plans to do with that cash I guess? And how should we think about that?
Alfonso Leon: As we go through the next few months in terms of getting to the way forward in our LNG projects, we have to get – good decisions where it did not represent any type of cost, in our cash flow and we have – lot of exposure to Kitimat. Once we have complete clarity [indiscernible] it is our objective to have over the next few months and we have some more at that, clearly at this very moment, we cannot bring that international cash to the United States without tax consequences. But that is something that we will have to continually looking at and figure out what we do about it. We do generate NOLs in the United States as we go along as that can give us path – as we find our way to bring that cash back.
Michael Hall – Heikkinen Energy: And one more if I could sneak it in on -- just total capital cost, just kind of the outlook you're seeing, particularly in the Permian, as you rollover contracts for the end of the year and into 2015. Any commentary around any cost increases you're seeing on drilling or pumping?
John Christmann: No, we just recently refrac tender and actually had a pumping services come down amazingly. So we see things pretty well, I mean there is pressure on the bigger rigs, 1500 horsepower rigs with top drives, there is more demand, for those will be just up a little bit, I think the big deal is with the efficiencies, the things we have been able to do, we have been able to maintain or lower our oil costs.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers.
Jeffrey Campbell – Tuohy Brothers: The first question I wanted to ask you was as I survey the Permian, the industry is moving towards stacked lateral moment on TAD. And when we see Apache horizontal success with the less than households name zones, Penn Shale [ph], Wichita, Albany, Strawn do those zones or that acreage have multi zone horizontal stag development potential?
John Christmann: That just varies, I think what they show you is the diversity of our asset base. So we got acreage in place, so not everybody is, and so we’ve got – and that’s the nice thing about our portfolio. While there are some areas in there where you could put multiple laterals, if you get over to the edge though in the Heady count, but some of those are really low zone targets but the nice thing about the Permian is that you got other stack zones that are – the strata that work as well. So that you are seeing horizontal drilling really grape hold in the central platform, the wells in Delaware and Midland basins.
Jeffrey Campbell – Tuohy Brothers: Going back to the Eagle Ford McCullough-Wineman well. Is that going to get more drilling near the Brazos-Burleson border or maybe push more into Burleson County? At the investment day, it looked like most of the drilling was taking place to the West. And I guess overall I'm asking what do you think is the direction of Eagle Ford delineation over the next several quarters?
John Christmann: I think McCullough-Wineman well, that is running very high on, it’s built in some things up and you will see us get very active in that area, Steve mentioned with Heady rigs, towards mid-year, as far as direction of where it goes, that’s not something we comment on at this point. We are excited about it on our acreage.
Jeffrey Campbell – Tuohy Brothers: And if I could sneak one quick one in on the use of cash. If the Montney and the Duvernay continue to create some excitement over time, could those programs become home for some of the international cash later on?
Steve Farris: We didn’t announce our results but I would say they were – we drilled two Montney wells now, we drilled two Duvernay wells, both of them are stellar walls. And we have quite a bit of acreage both in Montney and the Duvernay. We are drilling up right now to look at – when we talk about capital allocation because we are in the sober [ph] month in Canada, we will have a plan going in for our winter drilling starting at about August September that will probably look a little stronger in the Duvernay and Montney.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of James Sullivan with Alembic.
James Sullivan – Alembic: Just wanted to go back to the East Eagle Ford for a second. And you guys talked about the McCullough-Wineman well was a nice result. But I think you had a couple of wells drilling in the Reveille -- at least next to where you had the well -- the older well that you guys had talked about the 8, 9, and 10. Did you guys have results on that yet?
Steve Farris: We do not at this point, we [indiscernible] well there and so we are stacking some things up, that will be completed in the near future.
James Sullivan – Alembic: And then could you -- obviously you guys are sounding pretty high on the play based on the McCullough-Wineman results and that was over on the other side of the county there. But can you talk just a little bit about the geology there? I mean obviously you've discussed the launch at the analyst day, but I mean is it -- are you guys feeling it's quite repeatable across the acreage in terms of how continuous the section is and all that?
Steve Farris: It’s very practical as you go across, I think the thing we have seen in the area is the QRs go up little bit which is helping you, so little higher gas rate with it, which is a good thing. So we’re very encouraged – got more energy in the system –
James Sullivan – Alembic: If I could just switch over for a second to the Permian. I -- and let's see if I can express this question in a way that makes sense. But obviously you guys have an enormous vertical program that's transitioning over now into horizontal program. So in a sense the ramp in horizontal activity -- it's not coming in, in a vacuum you've got human capacity there for the vertical program and in logistics and so forth. Can you just characterize -- I mean actually you guys went down up by four vertical rigs and up by one in the horizontal. Is that, I know it's a little crude to think of it that way, but is that not a bad sense of scale in terms of how -- what you take from one program to give to the other in terms of capacity? If that makes sense?
John Christmann: It’s a good question. That is not how we think about it. I mean we look at the baseline, we really look at how the plays work on an economic basis and we have been shifting as we have been building the horizontals, you will see a little bit of continued trend as we add rigs, there will be likely to be horizontals. I think we’ve got a baseload program out there, really high graded projected with the verticals that we like to keep, I mean the nice thing about the verticals is we get on quick, the competitive rates of return and you don’t have to wait on pads and those things, so you will see us run a baseload of vertical rigs and then continue to grow the horizontal rig count.
Steve Farris: When you are setting your base, sort of when you confirm a vertical wells, I don’t decline likely horizontal wells, you kind of match vertical wells and get the base going up.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC.
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: Hey guys. Can you speak a little bit to how much acreage you have in the Permian and Upton and Reagan County's? It looks like you just start getting after that with some strong results there.
John Christmann: In terms of the acreage there, I mean we’ve got – we showed that at the analyst day those 3 counties I think couple hundreds, hundred thousand acreage, I need to check that exact number. Just a second.
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: While you're checking on the, you guys just mention the ability to sort of keep the vertical rig count consistent and add horizontal rigs over time. Could you give us a sense of where you think that number could go to? What is the current horizontal rig count today in the Permian? And I'm sure you guys have a plan over the next couple of years to ramp that up, could you maybe put some numbers around that?
John Christmann: Your first question, we got 292,000 acres in those 3 counties and 232,000 net. You got significant Wolfcamp exposure in and – when we look at our plan for the year, we plan on 39 rigs – total rigs, we plan on 26 horizontals and 13 verticals, so almost 2 in 1 horizontal and vertical ratio, that’s probably a pretty good ratio for where we are today, right now there is capacity growth – to put couple in there but as Steve alluded to, it’s about just people and execution.
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: I guess just talking to about asset sales here, I guess obviously you guys just announced the deepwater. I guess I thought it was a bit surprising. On previous calls you said there weren't a lot of big deals left in terms of selling assets. So I guess anything else we should expect on the asset sales side later this year?
Steve Farris: Well I tried to answer that earlier, when – the year end analyst call last year, we talked about portfolio of baskets that we were going to sell and we identified a number of candidates and quite frankly the deepwater was more of those candidates. The other thing we had decided is we went from stalled properties to something less than we thought the value to look for, so that assets it’s been on the list for over a year. We are going to make sure we got what we call we get value for that asset and it’s really – from our standpoint it wasn’t a surprise, we talked about order of magnitude, we have always indicated that we were moving out the deepwater, we still have about 900,000 barrels, 95,00 barrels today in the deepwater, we continue to reduce that. We are not going to sell it unless we find someone is willing to pay what we think is, and I mean what is worth, but in terms of our, really in the deepwater we will have done that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One.
Richard Tullis – Capital One: Steve, in today's press release announcing the sale of the deepwater, it sounds like the Company's planning to get a decent amount more active among the Gulf Coast. Could you give a little more detail there and maybe what activity could look like over the next year or two?
John Christmann: Well, as you are ware, a year or so ago, we went into effect the strategy to reposition ourselves in the Gulf of Mexico to become to be able to generate meaningful organic production growth on the shale. Now as the shale of course is when we had interest in about 500 blocks, 125 of those operated and most of which have never experienced any deep exploration. So it’s also where we transition our very experienced technical team out of deepwater with your advanced techniques for deepwater to similar geology on the shale and basically we are focusing on exactly the same horizons on the shale that we have been in deepwater for years. This is something that hasn’t experienced a lot of activity in the past. There is lot of advances to be in over the shelf, there is a lot of room for liquids rich and oil growth, there is a much shorter concept to realization times and when compared to the deepwater, and we can certainly leverage existing infrastructure to cut the time and the cost on this process. So it’s where – prospects can also better compete with the risk of our pretty robust global portfolio and that’s something that really for the last couple of years the deepwater has been able to do. So in short, we are going to move our technical talent, out of the deepwater and merge that with a much more sensible resources that are available on the shale. You may want to think about this as especially 2014 is a year of inventory builds, and we would expect to come out of the blocks in 2015 with a nice drilling line. I think we will hear our first real prospects and [rig count generated] realized in 2015.
Richard Tullis – Capital One: And just as a follow-up, does your partner Fieldwood have any activity currently along -- that you're involved in along the coast? Well results that we should look for near-term?
John Christmann: The only well that – really is the easing out with 136 which is put out in the first quarter, I think about 6 million a day and a few hundred barrels oil, I mean 300 barrels of oil, other than that, I don’t see any additional activity in the near term.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Doug Leggate with BofA Merrill Lynch.
Doug Leggate – BofA Merrill Lynch: Thanks good afternoon guys thanks for taking my questions. Steve in the Gulf of Mexico there the sale of Lucius and Heidelberg, what does that mean for the remaining interest you have in the deepwater in terms of your commitment to that area? In other words could they be for sale at some point?
Steve Farris: Let me answer that, I think maybe you didn’t hear me or maybe you can’t hear, I understand, maybe [indiscernible]. We still have about 96,00 barrels a day in the deepwater, it would have been nice to be part of a package that we sell. As I mentioned earlier, we made a decision about a year and a half ago that we weren’t going to sell anything under a value that we thought it was worth. So we are going to continue to operate those, we have 147 deepwater blocks, but you will see us migrate out of the deepwater either through producing that out and then abandoning it or if someone was interested in it, we certainly think it was worth for [ph]. But we have moved, that team – we moved that team to the shale where we have a significant acreage and I think the real opportunity to have more organic growth there.
Doug Leggate – BofA Merrill Lynch: Sorry I wasn't reading between the lines. So I'm guessing you originally had tried to sell that together with Lucius and Heidelberg and decided not to -- is that how we should think about it?
Steve Farris: Sorry, I didn’t quite catch up you.
Doug Leggate – BofA Merrill Lynch: Sorry, so just reading between the lines, should we assume that you tried to sell the entire package and decided against it -- decided to hang onto those assets? So they were for sale in other words?
Steve Farris: You bet.
Doug Leggate – BofA Merrill Lynch: Thanks for that. My follow-up is onshore and hopefully it's not too convoluted. But just comparing the operating report to last operating report, there seems to be a fair amount of movement in your acreage positions. And the one that jumps out is the Marmaton. It's dropped from 512,000 to 395,000 net acres. So I'm just wondering what's going on there? Is there active sort of high grading process going on or is this acreage expiry or what's causing the moving parts? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
Steve Farris: I can’t comment. John?
John Christmann: We got two rigs in the Marmaton in the first quarter, 26 we have working in the Anadarko basin.
Steve Farris: Yeah one other things -- we’re completely, we got an upper Marmaton and we’ve got a lower Marmaton. And I don’t know what’s in that book but it depends on if you are in that lower Marmaton, which is more gassy but it comes on like gangbusters for the upper Marmaton. So we need to reconcile that. I don’t know what those numbers, but I am sure as the total both upper and lower is probably the same number, I think we probably set up a lower Marmaton, we’ve got listed in there which is just subset of the total Marmaton.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Harry Mateer with Barclays.
Harry Mateer – Barclays Capital: Hi guys. Just a question for me on the balance sheet. Can you just give us an update on where you think the debt balance should be? Are you happy with your debt levels now or should we anticipate potential use of proceeds going forward to be further debt reduction?
Alfonso Leon: Clearly the strong position we don’t have any immediate need for any debt run up or debt reduction, we are in a very comfortable position and the most important question is what do we do with the cash coming out our way and what do we do once we complete will be pursuing on our LGN projects.
Harry Mateer – Barclays Capital: Okay. It’s fair to say it sounds like investing in the business and potential returns to shareholders are going to take priority over debt reduction at this point?
Steve Farris: I think what he said is, we don’t feel we need to pay down any debt. We just need to make sure we will be able to cover the things that we are liable for, and we are going to look at obviously certainly share buybacks at our current pledge or on the table.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to our presenters.
Castlen Kennedy: Great, that concludes our call for today. Once again we want to thank you for joining us and if you have any additional questions, feel free to reach out to investor relations. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference call and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is [Tammy], and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brady Parish, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.
Brady Parish: Thank you, Tammy. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation’s full year and fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. On today’s call, we will have three speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. I will start by giving a brief summary of results and then we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Tom Chambers, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, joining us for the question-and-answer session which will follow the prepared remarks are Roger Plank, President and Chief Corporate Officer; John Christmann, Executive Vice President and COO of North America; and Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President, COO of International. We prepared our quarterly financial supplemental data package for your use, which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations, pre-tax margins or cash margins. In addition, we have prepared an operations supplement which summarizes our activities and includes detailed well highlights across the various Apache operating regions. These can both be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financialinformation. Today’s discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website. This morning we reported 2013 earnings of $2.2 billion or $5.50 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results totaled $3.2 million or $7.92 per diluted share. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $9.8 billion for the year. During the fourth quarter, total net production averaged approximately 688,000 boe per day with liquids production constituting 55% of the total. Total net production excluding the noncontrolling interest in Egypt totaled 661,500 boe per day. In addition to the sales of the noncontrolling interest which closed on November 14th production during the fourth quarter was impacted by the sale of our Gulf of Mexico Shelf operations which closed on September 30th, the sales of selected Canadian assets which closed in September and October, and the impact of severe weather on our Permian and Central region operations all which we previously disclosed.  As a final note, I want to remind everyone about our upcoming Investor Day which will be held the morning of February 26th at Houston. Among other things we will be providing 2014 capital and production guidance, as well as a longer term view of our high graded portfolio is capable of achieving. We look forward to see you there. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Farris: Thank you, Brady. And excuse me, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks all of you for joining us. As Brady pointed out, despite the uncertainty surrounding our fourth quarter results associated with divestitures, Apache reported another year of strong financial results. We generated $3.2 billion of adjusted earnings and $9.8 billion cash flow from operations. And our performance is in large part due to the success of our strategy to rebalance our portfolio to drive returns by achieving the right mix of predictable production growth from North American onshore assets combined with substantial free cash flow generation from our International operations. During the past year we successfully executed our strategy in three important areas. Rebalancing our portfolio by divesting of assets that’s no longer fit our ideal growth for cash flow return profile but the end results being a higher growth, more predictable and profitable portfolio. Maintaining our relentless focus on being best-in-class in operational execution, which frankly has been a long time core of Apache over the years. Taking a discipline approach to capital allocation that enables us to grow production, reduce operating costs and enhance return to shareholders. First, with the Argentina sales which we have announced yesterday after the market close, we have largely accomplished what we have set out to do in 2010. To make our North American onshore regions a center piece of our growth strategy going forward. This latest transaction is on the heels of completing over $7 billion of divestitures in 2013, needed high grading our portfolio to include the right mix of assets capable of generating strong returns, driving more predictable production growth and enhancing shareholder value. We still have a couple of small packages, we are marketing one in South Texas and one in Canada, but we should get done in the first half this year, but in all we expect the heavy lifting is certainly behind us. Pro forma for 2013 completed transaction plus Argentina. Our North American onshore production represents nearly 60% of our total production during the fourth quarter of 2013. That’s up from 70% during 2009, the year before we embarked on our strategy to substantial bolster our North American resource base. In addition, our North American asset base which contains 1.81 billion barrels of oil equivalent approved reserve now represent 71% of our total year end reserves with the pro forma of Argentina and even a larger percentage of our total resource base. Second, with regard to operational execution, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our transition for North American onshore liquids growth in 2013, with all four of our onshore North American regions increase in liquids production at attractive rates of return. You can read more details about our operational performance in our operational supplement. But I am going to mention a few highlights. Our North American onshore liquids production increased nearly 46,000 barrels per day or 34% full year 2013 versus 2012. During the fourth quarter we averaged 187,000 barrels per day represents nearly 50% of our total worldwide liquids production and 27% of our overall production. Just as impressively, our 2013 onshore North America crude oil production grew nearly 23,000 barrels a day, which is an increase of 23% versus 2012. Our fourth quarter North American oil production averaged 134,000 barrels per day, representing nearly 19% of our total worldwide production. Both of these exceptional production growth rates place us in the top of our large peer group. Furthermore, our U.S. onshore resource base continues to deliver sector leading performance. During 2013, Apache was the most active onshore U.S. driller, running an average of 71 rigs and completing 1,150 gross wells. During the fourth quarter, we averaged a combined production of 227,000 barrels equivalent per day from our Permian and Central Regions alone. We are nearly one-third of our total production. In addition for the first time, we treated 100,000 barrels a day of combined crude oil production from these two regions. Importantly, we have combined our production growth with a relentless focus on operational execution and cost efficiency. In all of our onshore regions, we continue to do what Apache does best and that’s reduce costs, increase production, driving returns. During the fourth quarter, we lowered our lease operating by 11% to nearly $10 per boe. Finally, as I mentioned in our press release, we replaced 140% of our worldwide production to our exploration and development activities. We also grew our proved reserve base by nearly 4% on a pro forma basis. Excluding acquisitions, divestments and revisions, this was predominantly driven by our outstanding results from our onshore North American drilling activities from which we replaced over 200% of production. The Permian had exceptional performance, replacing nearly 325% of production and drilling reserves by nearly 14%, from 800 million barrels of oil equivalent to 910 million barrels of oil equivalent, which now comprises over 34% of our year end proved reserves. This is best-in-class versus Permian Basin operators in our weight class. Similarly, Central replaced nearly 200% of its production and grew its reserve by nearly 14% to 304 million barrels of oil equivalent, which constituted nearly 12% of our proved reserves. Third, with respect to capital allocation, on prior calls, we stated we will primarily use the net proceeds received from these divestitures to reduce debt and repurchase shares under our 30 million share authorization from our Board. Using a portion of the sales proceeds received during 2013, we reduced our debt by $2.6 billion to $9.7 billion and repurchase $1 billion of stocks at year end. In addition, we have repurchased $100 million of stocks so far this year, bringing the total number of shares to 12.4 million. We continue to believe our stock is a compelling investment at current price levels. Finally, we announced last week that our Board increased our 2014 quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.25 per share. This follows increases of 18% in 2013 and 13% in 2012. The significant increases are direct reflection of the confidence we have executing our future growth plans. As Brady mentioned, we are going to provide our 2014 capital and production guidance at our Investor Day on February 26th as well as provide a longer term view of what we believe our high graded portfolio is capable of achieving. I think you are going to be pleased with what you see. As a final comment, we firmly believe that the strides we have made in our efforts to rebalance our portfolio have enabled us to emerge from this process a stronger company. One that can continue to do what we do best. Exploit our inventory of opportunities, allocate capital to generate attractive returns, profitably and predictably grow our production and in the end create long-term value to our shareholders. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom Chambers.
Tom Chambers: Thanks, Steve and good afternoon everyone. Fourth quarter like the rest of the year was a busy one in terms of activities to reposition the portfolio. This was the first quarter without the shelf production. We completed two additional property sales in Canada and closed on the sale of one-third non-controlling interest in our Egypt business to Sinopec. We also bought back additional $750 million of Apache shares during the quarter, bringing the buyback to total of $1 billion in 2013 and in addition, paid down debt. Consequently, the quarter’s financial results were not fully reflective of Apache going forward in 2014. One key element I want to highlight before we go any further is the change you will notice in our financial reporting as a result of sale to Sinopec, up to one-third minority stake in our Egypt operations. Since we retained a controlling interest in the assets under the accounting standards, we continue to consolidate the entire region to reflect Sinopec's non-controlling interest separately in our financial statements. For instance, on our income statement, we back out Sinopec’s interest in the new line item called net income attributable to non-controlling interest. Similarly, production and reserves are also reported on a fully consolidated basis and the amount attributable to the non-controlling interest is indicated in footnotes of the tables. As a result, all of our comparable metrics remain the same. All data to which I refer is based on the GAAP numbers. The financial supplement also on our website provides additional details showing the impact to Apache on a net basis. Turning to the results, we finished the fourth quarter with production averaging nearly 690,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, lower than the previous quarter as expected, primarily impacted by the Shelf and Canadian property sales. More importantly though we created a strong foundation on which to move forward. During the year, we were able to shift our production mix to 54% liquids, up from 51% in the prior year. Also, North American onshore liquids production increased over 34% from 2012. Oil price realizations averaged approximately $102 per barrel for the year, down 1% from 2012. For the quarter, oil realizations were 6% lower than third quarter at a $100.59 per barrel. Bear in mind for the quarter and going forward, with the divestiture of our Shelf assets, less of our oil production is receiving Brent like prices, which directly reduces our overall realizations. We are now seeing about 60% of our oil production priced at Brent or Brent comparable indexes, down from 64% in the third quarter. Gas prices for the year averaged $3.70, a $0.10 per mcf decrease from last year as our prior year hedges rolls off. For the quarter, bit of a cold weather propped up prices to $3.71 in mcf, 6% higher than the sequential quarter. Heading into 2014, we have hedged 62,500 barrels per day of each Brent and WTI oil at a $100 and $91 per barrel respectively. On the gas side, we’ve hedged 100 million cubic feet a day of gas, commencing in February, rising to 150 million cubic feet per day in March through December at an average price of $4.29. All hedges are financial and not cash flow hedges. Despite a year with a lot of moving parts, we are able to report solid earnings of $2.2 billion or $5.50 per share, up $0.14 -- 14% from 2012 despite the impact of several key non-recurring items. Our results included $659 million in after-tax non-cash property write-downs primarily related to full cost ceiling impairments in the U.S., North Sea and Argentina. We also distributed $643 million in cash proceeds received from our strategic partnership with Sinopec in Egypt, back to the U.S. which resulted in a deferred tax charge of approximately $225 million. In current year net operating loss will be utilized to offset any current tax otherwise due on this repatriation. We had unrealized after-tax derivative losses of $142 million and the $65 million benefit in other deferred taxes associated with foreign currency fluctuations and valuation allowances. When we remove all these non-cash items for comparability purposes we earn $3.2 billion or $7.92 per share for 2013 versus $3.8 billion a year ago. Operating cash flows remain strong given the performance of our North America onshore base. We generated $9.8 billion cash flow from operations before working capital items and $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Total cash operating expenses were $17.32 per barrel of oil equivalent for the quarter and $17.62 for the full year. The lower rate in the fourth quarter reflects some of the benefits of exiting the higher cost Shelf properties, the lease operating expenses which we have done over $1 per boe from sequential quarter. Apache’s cash margins decreased by 5% versus the third quarter to $40.50 per boe and 5% versus the prior year to $40.99 per boe, primarily driven by lower oil prices and realized derivative losses. Our product mix and shift to geographic emphasis has also impacted our tax rate for the quarter. Our effective tax rate after adjusting for non-recurring items was 44%, higher than historical. This was the result of loss of Shelf revenue which skewed our total revenue to our higher tax rate international regions. This higher tax rate, plus the lower realizations discussed earlier could be two of the main differences between reported and consensus estimates. Likewise our effective tax rate for the full year 2013 was 46%. Adjusting for non-recurring items mentioned earlier, the effective tax rate would have been a more typical 42%. The $7 billion in cash proceeds from our Egypt Shelf and Canadian transactions we were able to effectively deploy the cash to increase drilling in 2013, enhance our [audio gap] and commence our share buyback program. We increased our U.S. onshore drilling program by $700 million over our original budget, paid down debt by $2.6 billion to $9.7 billion at year end and bought back share in 2013 totaling $1 billion. We purchased an additional $100 million of stock in January bringing the total buyback since inception to $1.1 billion and 12.4 million shares bringing the outstanding share count as of end of January at 394.7 million shares. Just as important we exited the year with a debt to capitalization ratio of 22%, no commercial paper outstanding and $1.9 billion in cash which adds flexibility to our balance sheet and is a nice position to have as we head into 2014. This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn call back over to Brady?
Brady Parish: Thank you, Tom. Operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Co.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Co.: As highlighted in your operations of data, I noticed in the Permian a change in some of your net acreage positions, have you done some recent land work or is it just a new assessment of prospectivity for the different zones in the Permian?
Steve Farris: Pearce, it’s really something we continually do as we look at this and some areas we picked up some acreage, some areas we have let it little bit go. So I think that’s the dynamics of what we are doing. Also in the plays we’re chasing we’ll be acquiring. So it’s a little bit of everything and I think we will outline that in great detail in a couple of weeks at the Analyst Day.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Co.: Great. And then a follow-up, it was the big industry-wide ramp in activity in the Permian, how are service costs trending there right now and what have you done not relating yourself from any surface cost creep or service availability issues?
Steve Farris: We continue to the business as we build critical math and we’re in the low 40 rig count the Permian for mid part of last year. So I think it’s something we got people in place we got relationships in place, we’ve kept frac crews and drilling rigs busy. So that’s been very good. I think in general we see cost trending now and they are flat right now in terms of service. A lot of that at this point is going to be driven by efficiencies. Producing days are just getting better and the exploits we continue to do every day.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Co.: Great. And then the last one for me, I know it’s the gathering transmission and processing facility capital spending, last year was a big enough to think about 1.3 million up from nearly 800 million year before. Is that something, is that little more one-off or you would expect it to be at these elevated levels for a while?
Steve Farris: Again we looked at the detail of the chart, I would assume that it’s one of our Wheatstone project and also we built the plant in (inaudible) it’s a best plant in (inaudible) it’s probably the uptick. The vast majority of it would be associated with our Wheatstone LNG in Australia.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Co.: Thank you very much, Steve
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein.
Bob Brackett - Bernstein: Okay. Following up on the comment on the heavy lifting behind us in terms of asset sales, how does that drive with the notion of the Sinopec deal being part of a strategic partnership?
Steve Farris: When I was talking about its repositioning, we are probably out. In terms of what we set out to do several years ago actually is North America went to work is centerpiece of our growth because we have over 3 million acres in the Permian, we have over 2 million acres in the Anadarko Basin and we have some plays in South Texas, we have some plays in Canada. And that’s going to attract most of the capital, but it really taking about is the base in terms of either having assets that can grow or assets that provide cash flow and if they can’t do either, that’s not going to be part of the portfolio.
Bob Brackett - Bernstein: And then on the other question, if I look at sort of the implied price at which you were repurchasing your equity. It’s probably closed to the high 80s, almost touching 90 and we’re sitting here today at a much more attractive entry point. How does that drive your thinking about the share repurchases?
Steve Farris: No. I think I said in my prepared remarks, we view our stock as a good investment price now. I think our average price was probably around 85 bucks or little. I don’t have that in front of me.
Bob Brackett - Bernstein: Well, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo: Hi. Good morning. Can I just talk about the ramp? I guess, good afternoon. Sorry. Could I just talk about the ramps and the vertical to the horizontal and in the Permian. How should we think about that over the next whatever -- next four quarters, next six quarters, I’m just trying to figure out with you guys, what that looks like?
Steve Farris: David, I think where we ended the fourth quarter was about 50-50 on the terms of what you see out there. We did start dropping some vertical rigs in the third quarter as we transitioned and picked up some verticals. Right now, we’re running slightly more horizontals and verticals and I would anticipate that trend moving forward. We’ll get into the details at the Analyst Day as we start looking forward.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo: Okay. And then if I just -- I hate to ask a detailed question. If I could just ask about the weather impact in both the Permian and Central. Did you guys have -- I’m just trying to figure out what the true run rate is for what those region ex weather impact. Can you give us…
John Christmann: In Permian, it was about 3,000 BOE a day, net in terms of the fourth quarter. Most of that was from the November storm that hit pretty hard. Central was a smaller number and it was not as impacted as we were in Permian.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo: Okay. And all the weather impacts behind for now?
John Christmann: You will see several numbers in Central as you look going into January and February and a little bit Permian as well.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo: Okay. I’ll let somebody else chip in. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Malone with Mizuho Securities.
Steve Farris: Two questions is enough.
John Malone - Mizuho Securities: Good afternoon. One, just, can you give us an update on Kitimat, the marketing process here, I’m going to talk now about Asian companies looking at gas and (inaudible) anything you can comment on that and how things are going there?
Steve Farris: Well, I will tell you with Chevron as our Partner and Chevron is leading that effort. The downstream and the pipeline is now operated by Chevron, really part of the marketing. We have a dual marketing agreement but certainly Chevron with their knowledge and history in the market is leading that. I can tell you we continue to talk to people more than just slightly. I think what we said, I know I said it in Goldman this -- this year is a year. We got to rightsize the size of Kitimat in our portfolio and that could come several different ways. One is with a Sinopec buyer taking an interest across the board. But I happen to read, John Watson’s comment in Chevron’s year end conference call. Certainly it is a big asset for them and it is a big asset for us.
John Malone - Mizuho Securities: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. There is a question for Tom. It looks like there was an uptick if I’m reading correctly and the additional portion is of DD&A. Can you just tell me what was behind that?
Tom Chambers: There was a lot of DD&A and I kind of went through a number of those on the call. We had write-offs. We had charge for bringing cash back to certain charge of $225 million to bring cash back. So when you add all that in, that picked up DD&A.
John Malone - Mizuho Securities: Okay. So all that you mentioned now gets piled into that, that additional DD&A number?
Tom Chambers: Yes.
John Malone - Mizuho Securities: Okay. Perfect. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Good afternoon.
Steve Farris: Hi Brian.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs: In Permian, you highlighted in the ops update, you are buying hard area and the Reagan County as the key component of the Wolfcamp program. Can you put into context your views on the rest of your Midland and Wolfcamp acreage, the differences and similarities you see in the upper versus the middle zone wells and whether you plan to test any of the shallower zones horizontally?
John Christmann: At this point, Brian, (inaudible) lot of wells. We ramped six rigs versus last year. We currently got five in there right now. As there we got and it really work hard to try to understand. I think as we all know as you move back to the lower to the west and Midland Basin, we’ve had good results. Clearly, we got, I think seven rigs running in those other areas. So it’s area we will start to shift to, take our learnings from Barnhart and that’s something we will walk through in two weeks as we outline in our Analyst Day. But there is also multiple other zones that we’re looking at there. And so not just in the Wolfcamp.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs: Got it. Now you’re seeing some of the results so far from the Upper, from the Middle and the Barnhart?
Steve Farris: I would say good results from both zones.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thanks. And then separately just in terms of how you’re thinking about 2014 maybe this is more analyst material but can you just talk about CapEx versus cash flow and level of comfort without spending versus not outstanding this year ex Kitimat and Wheatstone and with Kitimat and Wheatstone?
John Christmann: In terms of the details of all that we’ll certainly get into that on in our February 26 Analyst Day. I think I’ve said at Goldman conference. We’re going to look within our cash flow with our E&D budget and we’re going to finance our LNG project outside of our cash flow.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale.
John Herrlin - Societe Generale: Two quick ones, assuming you’ve maintained a kind of run rate in Permian and Central as you have been on a spending basis and activity basis. Should we expect if prices are kind of constant to have a similar or large amount of reserve ads in terms of expansion discoveries. As far as I can recall, this is the most onshore ad you’ve ever had onshore. That’s one -- if this is run rate basis we’ll see this repeat?
Steve Farris: Well, certainly let me kind of answer that directly. We’re going to show a lot of that on the 26th of February. But what we’ve been up to over the last three years is to make those certainly the Permian and Central region and some of the other things we’re doing in North America, the center piece of our growth. So we would expect to continue to be able to grow on Permian, Central and our overall onshore North American assets.
John Herrlin - Societe Generale: Okay. Thanks Steve. Regarding Argentina, you did have a lot of unconventional potential. Was it just not worth all the hassles, political in terms of getting money out of the country in terms of repatriation?
Steve Farris: It’s a situation that is for us. It was 3% or 4% of our reserve, 3% or 4% of our production. And if you think about the opportunities that we have in North American onshore and you think about bringing that money forward, what we can do with, it made all the sense in the world, John.
John Herrlin - Societe Generale: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America: Thanks everybody. Hey Steve, I was wondering if I could just come back on portfolio rationalization question. Specifically when you sold the Gulf of Mexico, one of the, I guess, justifications was the reserve life had -- it is difficult to see how you could replicate recent terms of the market and have been able to give credit for it. But it did generate free cash flow. I’m just wondering, it seems to me that the U.K. kind of falls into lot of the same categories. So I guess, my question is are you not done with your portfolio rationalization and if so why does U.K. to rank as competing for capital versus the onshore. And I’ve got a quick follow-up please.
Steve Farris: Yeah. What we have said is we want assets that generates substantial cash flow. We want assets that can grow. In the North Sea, we’ve been able to generate quite a bit of excess cash flow while keeping it relatively quiet. But one thing I would say, the difference between that and Gulf of Mexico we were facing about $250 million a year of abandonment liability because of the change in the laws, because of Macondo, so it was time to divest that asset.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America: Okay. So do you (inaudible).
Steve Farris: What we have on the books right now is our assets going forward and we think we have tremendous potential to grow where we are.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America: Great. I appreciate that. And maybe my follow-ups for Tom maybe. Tom, you gave us the earnings number for the non-controlling interest, I wondered -- and which is the housekeeping question though, I wonder if you can give us cash flow numbers associated with that and I will leave it there? Thanks.
Tom Chambers: I don’t have the cash flow, you know the way the accounting, accounts work there wasn’t very much actual cash flow that came out and since we didn’t do the acquisition for the sale until middle of November, but it’s going to come out in investing and will show up in investing activities on a go forward basis. I don’t have that number in front of me Doug, but we can get. If you call Brady afterwards, he will get it for you.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America: All right. Thanks everybody.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC.
Leo Mariani - RBC: Just a follow-up question here on Argentina, would you guys expect to report that is discontinued operations at all in the first quarter, or is it going to stay in your financials until the deal closes? And then I guess additionally, are you guys going to be able to repatriate all that capital back to the U.S. and there isn’t going to be any tax leakage.
Tom Chambers: Leo, we are still looking at how we are going to report. Obviously, we just signed the deal yesterday, hasn’t closed yet. So we are looking at, by the end of the day we should have an answer on how we are going to report it. In terms of the cash, the cash will remain overseas until we determine what our needs are both internationally and domestically.
Leo Mariani - RBC: Okay, I guess…
Steve Farris: And the currency is U.S. dollars.
Tom Chambers: U.S. dollars.
Leo Mariani - RBC: Okay. I guess just looking at Egypt here, kind of getting into your financial supplement, it looks like your gross production kicked up this quarter from Q3 in the first time a little while. Do you guys see any kind of renewed growth going forward? In Egypt I think your rig count has been pretty steady, but I guess the growth production hadn’t done much until this quarter. Just trying to get a sense of dynamic there, do you guys think that you have done better captive growth here going forward?
Steve Farris:  I think that the uptick that we have seen in the fourth quarter is largely a timing thing. We had a fairly slow process in getting new development leases approved, but what’s that happened at the beginning in the year of the third quarter we had that uptick in production and you are seeing all the new discoveries coming online at this point in time. That’s the explanation to that.
Leo Mariani - RBC: Okay. And I guess that is looking at the Gulf of Mexico Shelf, I thought it was a little bit of production in the fourth quarter, is that just prior period adjustment or is that actually some lingering legacy stuff and maybe one so?
Steve Farris: Well, I think it’s associated with the state water stuff that we have.
Tom Chambers: But also remember we had some rights that didn’t close until the fourth quarter, so that reflects the production off of properties until they close.
Leo Mariani - RBC: Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy.
Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy: I guess, first on my and the operational supplement had some info on the Delaware Basin, just curious, it look likes it’s pretty low working interest on the acreage position there. How much of that is operated and all the activity you are moving forward here near term? Are there any particular areas that you are focused on and what’s the interest looks like around those assets?
Steve Farris: When you look at Delaware Basin position, we have picked up a lot of that through BP and so we do some metals which has some lower interest and the good news is we’ve got high nets. There is an update to the operational supplement that Chaparral 89 #101H, it’s a 3rd Bone Spring horizontal. We had opened the chokes as well as the numbers in the report are flowing, it’s now making 972, it’s kind of a peak on the oil side at 3.4 million for boe a day of 1,375 and 30 day average now is over 1,000 barrels a day. We have got another one in the Shelf and we have the demonstrated staying on. So we are excited about the Delaware and which is our acreage position, it’s taken us a little longer to accomplish some things together and get some critical mass so we can clear in a position to drill horizontally in there.
Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy: Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks. Look forward to more color at the Analyst Day and then I guess last one, you have mentioned a package for sale in South Texas, any color around what exactly for sale there, is it more, is it there, getting your asset?
Steve Farris: Yeah. I -- its small gas assets that are just scattered around the South Texas, they are just cleaned up.
Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy: Okay, and…
Steve Farris: I am sorry?
Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy: Not the big block usage in era?
Steve Farris: I mean which is drilling in so we are drilling quite a few well in that part of the world right now.
Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Magner with Macquarie.
Joe Magner - Macquarie: Good afternoon. I want to follow up on the Barnhart’s question from earlier. It looks like in the ops report volumes in December were down to 10,000 barrels a day, I think that’s down from around 13,000 barrels a day in early October. I am just curious what’s happening there at the Barnhart.
Steve Farris: It’s a timing issue, I mean I think now what we have found is with five rigs running out there currently right now, we now have to drill sections and some buffer before we go on and complete the lot of wells. So it’s just a simple timing issue of when you bring those pads on, I mean right now with the section where we laid out four uppers and four lowers, we think we can get those on with five to six rigs running and two frac crews in about 90 to 120 days. And so it’s purely a timing issue of brining production on.
Joe Magner - Macquarie: Okay. And that’s four lower, four upper is that sort of the spacing that you determine is optimal for that area?
Steve Farris: We will go into more of that on Analyst Day, but I mean right now that’s kind of where we are, but I think as you look the unconventional, just like conventional in Permian you know you have been in for drilling for 50 years in this type rock. And when you look at the unconventional, they are even tighter. So I think there is going to be room to continue downspacing as we go forward.
Joe Magner - Macquarie: Okay. Just one clarification Steve you mentioned what’s in the portfolio now is what would be in the going forward. There has been some talk about potential deepwater Gulf of Mexico transaction, any update or thoughts on that?
Steve Farris: No, I think we stand by our statement. What we are going into 2014 now with the Argentina now I will tell you, Argentina was the long-term company, we have worked on that for a months and months and months, but in terms of assets that we have right now as stands Argentina and stands the Canadian gas package, small Canadian gas package, I don’t want to over-emphasize that, I just want to bring up that we have couple of other things marketing out there. The assets which you see right now, the assets we are going to go forward with and I will be real honest with you, I am extremely excited about what we are today.
Joe Magner - Macquarie: Okay. Thanks for the update.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.
Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research: Good afternoon. I want to go back into the Delaware again and just be a little bit more specific. In the supplement that you put out, you have said that you got to achieve commercialization of the 2nd and 3rd Bone Springs and the Wolfcamp and Reeves and Loving County. I was wondering if you could just give some color as to what commercialization means maybe on acreage or locations and are this going to be develop simultaneously on that?
Steve Farris: Well, Jeff, Oldham County specifically, we’ve got a really nice block of acreage out there. We got three rigs running right now. We’re drilling second third most rigs both, as well as in Wolfcamp. So we’ve got a play that we feel really good about in there and the numbers are starting to show and that Shelf well that is update to be honest, one of the third Bone Springs that we brought on in December. So the nice thing about that area it doesn’t take big acreage block because you can stack a lots of horizontals in and we’ve got a pretty good material block in there with high, high nets and we’re very excited about it.
Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research: Okay. That’s helpful. And another question I have was with regard to the rocker B on 106 Cline well. I notice that was completed in Reagan County and I was wondering first of all just one of your first Reagan Cline wells and going forward is the program going to increase in Reagan or is it going to still predominantly be Glasscock?
Steve Farris : That is one of our first wells in Reagan, I think as we get over there. You got multiple branches in the Wolfcamp and we’re also excited about the Cline basin to do. So we continue to test our acreage and as we set up our 2014, ’15, ’16 and beyond programs, we got to get in and understand all the various expansions and that’s exactly what that is.
Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One.
Richard Tullis - Capital One: Good afternoon, everyone. Steve, just a quick question on the Gulf of Mexico shallow water subsalt play, what has been the recent activity there and how does it fit into your plans for 2014 based on what you see so far?
Steve Farris : Let me give you an overview and then I’d like number that we have achieved to run that some detail. The exploration potential varies significant and what we -- what is the reason we retain that 50% is that we don’t to dreg the base on the shallow Shelf. But we have a real opportunity to grow that in the future. And with that, Tom, you might mention some of the things we are doing.
Tom Voytovich: There are a couple of rigs active. They are all outside operated at this point time on the shelf itself. The most notable one probably is the appraisal well to our (inaudible) which is main pass 295. That appraisal well is making whole as we speak and in the next 45 days or so we are to see some results from that, it’s a down-dip appraisal test to establish reserve magnitudes and hopefully provide us with our first drainage point in that field. There are other wells underway. I believe there are two other ones that are drilling or completing. There are fairly low-risk tests being drilled as well. We don’t have any results on that at this point. We see that they are fairly slow in 2014, as we convert over from the old Gulf of Mexico shelf to the new program. And I think it will take a while to build inventory and prioritize those so that we can look forward to the feature. I think it’s an outstanding opportunity for growth.
Richard Tullis - Capital One: All right. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of the Michael Rowe with Tudor Pickering, Holt & Company.
Michael Rowe - Tudor Pickering, Holt & Company: Yes, good afternoon. I just want to follow-up on the discussion of severance costs, trends in the Permian and kind of wondering if you could talk about sort of recent well cost you’re seeing down in the region and particularly for the Barnhart assets where you all have been drilling some longer laterals.
John Christmann: Yeah, I think, in general things are holding pretty good. I mean, we’re getting more efficient there. But in some areas, we’re also experimenting on the completion side and putting more sand in and less fluid and those various things. So we’ll get into those in detail but I feel good about the cost. And obviously if we want to increase our completion size, obviously we expect to get bigger recoveries for that relative. So it’s all about either taking cost down or increased our EURs, and that’s something that Steve highlighted in the opening comments about our operation excellence we will continue to do. But I think in general, they are at a point right now where they are holding pretty firm its topline and it’s all about what kind of efficiencies we can drive in right now.
Michael Rowe - Tudor Pickering, Holt & Company: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on that would be. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, maybe this is an Analyst Day question but maybe some of the Wolfcamp potential that you see in Glasscock Counties specifically and where you all primarily have been drilling the Cline information?
John Christmann: Yes, that is something we’ll get into in Analyst Day. I mean, it’s right there in Deadwood where we’ve been. It is more heavily in the Cline and you’ve got the Wolfcamp coming off and it does not lend itself quite as much for horizontals right in the area we are. Get South of us there, the geology changes, you see a lot more activity. But we’ll get into more detail about that at Analyst Day. And then, I would also expect to see us drill a couple of horizontal Wolfcamp wells done there as well.
Michael Rowe - Tudor Pickering, Holt & Company: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles Meade - Johnson Rice: Good afternoon, everyone. If I could go back and ask another question about the Permian. One of the things that distinguishes you guys -- Apache, from a lot of the other independent E&Ps out there, particularly in the Permian Basin is your big position on the Central Basin platform. And I noticed in your operation supplement you have, you made a point of saying that three bar field had one of that, I guess, it was a second highest production increase in the quarter. But you really only detail one well there which was at the, I guess the Three Bar Shallow and the Wichita Albany. I’m worried if you can give us an idea, there’s been a lot of questions on the Wolfcamp and the Midland Basin, a lot of these Delaware Basin, unconventional plays? Can you give us an idea where your Central basin platform projects or target fit in terms of relative attractiveness with these other more industry-led horizontal drilling programs?
John Christmann: Yeah, it’s a great question. It's something that tends to get overlooked is the potential for horizontal in the Central basin platform. I’ll tell you that Wichita Albany play at Three Bar will stack up against anything in the industry. We’ve got 16 wells on there. We did give highlight, that is in the year we’ve got and there has also been fantastic there. We are looking at taking that play outside of that, just on Three Bar unit there but additionally as you start to look up and down the section, there are all sorts of zone that we’ve not completed vertically or not drilled vertically that make great horizontal targets. And we always typically have run one to two rigs on the Central basin platform. I think we’ve got three of -- they are right now and they are chasing these exact types of things. And there is lots of oil to be found in Central basin platform.
Charles Meade - Johnson Rice: So just to be clear, I think you said it John but I want to make you understand, you said what you’re seeing there is as good as any of these horizontal conventional plays you’re seeing elsewhere in the Permian basin?
John Christmann: Our Three Bar development, absolutely.
Charles Meade - Johnson Rice: Okay, thanks for that detail.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions in the queue. Mr. Brady, do you have any closing remarks?
Brady Parish: Excuse me. No, I don’t have any closing remarks. I just wanted to say thank you all for participating in the call and putting up with my cold. And if you have any additional question, please reach out to Investor Relations. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Rachel, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter Earnings -- 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brady Parish, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.
Brady Parish: Thank you, Rachel. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation’s third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. On today’s call, we will have three speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. I will start by giving a brief summary of the third quarter results, and then we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Tom Chambers, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, joining us for the question and answer session which will follow the prepared remarks are Roger Plank, President and Chief Corporate Officer; Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer; Tom Voytovich, Executive Vice President for International Operations and John Christmann, Region Vice President for our Permian region. We prepared our quarterly financial supplemental data package for your use, which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations, pre-tax margins or cash margins. In addition, we have prepared an operations supplement which summarizes our activities, includes detailed well highlights across the various Apache operating regions. These can both be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financialinformation or financial info. Today’s discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website. This morning we reported third quarter 2013 earnings of $300 million or $0.75 per diluted share, cash flow from operations before changes in working capital totaled over $2.7 billion. Adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $932 million or $2.32 per diluted share. During the third quarter, total net production averaged approximately 784,000 boe per day with liquids production constituting 54% of the total. This represents an increase over the 771,000 boe per day reported in the third quarter of 2012 and a decrease from the 790,000 boe per day reported in the second quarter of 2013. Production in the third quarter of 2013 was negatively impacted by a decrease in North Sea production 6,100 boe per day predominantly due to a planned turnaround at 40s as well as natural field declines in the offshore Gulf of Mexico and Australia, all of which we guided to on our second quarter earnings call. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Farris: Thank you, Brady, and good afternoon, everyone. And thank you everybody for joining us. As Brady mentioned, we’re delighted to have Tom Voytovich and John Christmann, join Roger and Rod and Tom Chambers and me on the call. And although Tom and John are not officially assuming their new Co-COO positions until the beginning of 2014, in typical Apache fashion they’re burning the candle at both ends rapidly getting up to speed with respect to their new responsibilities. As Brady pointed out, Apache reported another solid quarter generating $932 million of adjusted earnings and $2.7 billion of cash flow from operations before changes in working capital. On the operational results I’d highlight one number, Apache’s North America onshore liquids production grew by 49,000 barrels of oil a day or 35% from the third quarter of 2012 reaching nearly 190,000 barrels. Our North American onshore oil production grew by 26% during the same period to 129,000 barrels a day. During this time those regions made no acquisitions, so this is a 100% drill bit generated growth and it puts Apache in the top-tier of North America onshore liquids growth generators among all our peers. Apache continued to be most active US onshore driller in the third quarter running an average of 77 rigs and completing 306 gross wells. Importantly, we coupled our production growth with a relentless focus on operation and cost efficiency to ensure that our wells are not only increasing production but doing so at attractive returns. In all our onshore regions, we continue to drive down drilling and completion costs. And I’ll give you a couple of examples. Year-to-date we reduced our drilling and completions costs by $1.5 million per well in Tonkawa play in the Anadarko Basin and over $1 million per well in the Wolfcamp and Cline Shale plays in the Permian Basin. And we expect to further reduce these well costs as we optimize our development activities in these plays. You can read more details about our operational performance this quarter in our quarterly operation supplement which has been posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. Commensurate with building a deep asset base in North America onshore and delivering leading liquids growth performance, we set about restructuring our portfolio to focus more around this North American onshore resource base. We’ve successfully completed the lion share of that portfolio review. We’ve already announced in excess of $7 billion of divestitures aimed at rebalancing our portfolio to include the right mix of assets capable of generating strong returns, driving more predictable growth and enhancing shareholder value. As a result of these efforts North American onshore production was 56% of our production in the third quarter pro forma for the transactions we have announced year to date. That’s up from less than a third in 2019, the year before we embarked on our strategy to substantially bolster our North American onshore resource base. This was achieved through a number of key steps during the third quarter. We exited our production operations in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf. This transaction closed on September 30 and generated $3.6 billion in cash proceeds. We expect another $200 million of cash from prep [ph] properties to be received in the fourth quarter. In addition, with this transaction, we removed $1.5 billion of P&A obligations and given the maturity of the Gulf of Mexico Shelf, this step strengthens the production growth profile and reserve life visibility of our portfolio. It also goes a long way in eliminating a significant historical volatility factor in our production profile, hurricanes and other Gulf of Mexico offshore weather events. Those of you who have followed us for many years will understand that this was a big step for Apache but it was a right time for us because of our expanded visible and profitable opportunity base in North American onshore. We have retained half of the deep rights exploration across our divested properties. So while we have exited that production, we are still very much exposed to the value of the upside in hydrocarbon rich region, especially in the sub-salt play. The other thing that it’s done for us is it’s given us an opportunity to grow without the significant declines we have seen on the shale or the P&A liability. The second major step in the quarter was our partnership with Sinopec in Egypt. We are taking a one-third interest in our Egypt business in exchange for $3.1 billion in cash. We are on track to close this transaction in the fourth quarter. As we indicated for some time we have been looking for a way to validate the value of our business in Egypt and I think we delivered on that. The transaction allows us to continue grow at attractive rates of return in Egypt, without Egypt being excessively largely component of our portfolio.  In joining forces with Sinopec, we’ve gained a very well suited partner who will add value to our operations and positioning in Egypt, and we expect to pursue a number of future growth projects jointly in different geographies around the world. A third component of our portfolio of focusing steps in the third quarter was high grading our Canada properties. We have divested in excess of $300 million of properties there, primarily consisting of maturing gas properties. Having captured a very large resource base there, we are turning Canada into our horizontal drilling growth region that we can expect, or we do expect to compete with the Permian and the Anadarko basin, and rationalizing some of our legacy assets has been an important step in that process. With these strategic steps, we are now positioned to drive more predictable growth through our enlarged North America onshore resource base and we also have the financial strength to fund that growth from our international free cash flow, the diversity of opportunities to complement it with very profitable international projects. We are still actively pursuing additional divestitures. We continue to be disciplined in our approach and we will only execute transactions that contribute to our overall strategic and financial goals. With respect to capital allocation, on prior calls, we stated we would use proceeds that we receive from these divestitures to reduce debt and repurchase shares under our 30 million share authorization from our board. Using a portion of the sales proceeds received, we paid down almost $2 billion of debt during the third quarter and have repurchased approximately $700 million of stock, putting us well on our way of achieving our stated use of proceeds objectives. Regarding the remaining proceeds from the Gulf of Mexico Shelf and the expected proceeds to be received from the Egypt partnership, we have been evaluating the most tax efficient way to fund international capital investment, pay down additional debt, repurchase shares and fund capital investments in our onshore U.S. regions. We are currently running an accelerated pace in our Permian and Central regions. At our current pace, we will drill over 800 wells in the Permian versus 700 originally planned and over 375 wells in the Central versus the 300 that were originally planned there. This will increase our capital investment in those two regions by a combined $700 million to $800 million this year. Based upon this increased drilling activity we would expect onshore North American liquids to grow nearly 35% during 2013 versus the 25% growth rate we previously guided. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom Chambers.
Tom Chambers: Thanks, Steve. This morning we reported third quarter earnings of $300 million or $0.75 per share, adjusted earnings of $932 million or $2.32 per share. 784,000 barrels of equivalent of net daily production and over $2.7 billion of cash flow from operations before working capital items. Overall, our bottom-line results reflect another solid financial performance for this quarter. Oil and gas revenues totaled $4.4 billion, a $300 million increase over the second quarter driven primarily by higher oil prices with oil comprising 80% of total revenues despite only accounting for 46% of our total production on a boe basis. Including the impact of hedging, third quarter oil prices averaged $107.50 per barrel, up $9.57 per barrel from the second quarter, while gas prices averaged $3.49 per mcf down $0.38 from the second quarter. For the quarter, oil continued to sell for more than 30 times the price of North American natural gas. Our total cash operating expenses were down slightly for the quarter to $17.53 per barrel of oil equivalent, primarily as a result of lower lifting cost and G&A expenses as we continue to focus on reducing costs. As a result of our commodity mix and reduced cash operating costs, Apache’s cash margin increased by over 7% versus the second quarter to a healthy $42.74 per boe. Turning to earnings, we had several adjustments which impacted our results. Earnings for the quarter were negatively impacted by $478 million after-tax adjustment for non-cash property write-downs, including one in the US, predominantly related to our restructuring efforts, one in Argentina, relating to expiring concessions and one in Kenya, following our decision to exit the country. These were offset somewhat by $28 million deferred tax benefit for foreign currency fluctuations and other deferred tax benefits totaling $31 million. In addition, we recorded an unrealized non-cash after-tax commodity derivative mark-to-market loss of $213 million primarily related to our 2014 oil hedges. We hedged 62,500 barrels per day of WTI accrued at almost $91 per barrel and 62,500 barrels a day of Brent crude at just over $100 per barrel versus realizations which were roughly $5 and $3 per barrel higher for WTI and Brent respectively as of the end of the third quarter. When we remove these non-cash items for comparability purposes, we earn $932 million or $2.32 per share for the third quarter versus $2.16 a year ago and $2.01 in the second quarter of this year. In the third quarter Apache generated $2.7 billion of cash flow from operations before working capital items demonstrating our ability to generate consistent operating cash flows to support our robust drilling program and other planned capital expenditures. Turning to taxes, the third quarter effective tax rate primarily reflects the impact of the adjustments just mentioned, excluding these items our effective tax rate would have been 42%. Similarly, these adjustments impacted our percentage of deferred taxes in the quarter. We would expect the deferred rate of approximately 28% for the year after these adjustments. I would like to emphasize, as Steve just mentioned, we utilized a portion of the cash proceeds from the Gulf of Mexico Shelf sale and our first Canadian asset sale to reduce debt by $1.85 billion from the second quarter of this year. This decreased our debt-to-capitalization ratio to 25% at the end of the quarter from 28% at the end of the second quarter. We also utilized these proceeds to repurchase an additional $450 million of stock in October bringing the repurchased total to $700 million to date and nearly eight million shares. Also, as Steve mentioned, regarding the remaining proceeds from the Gulf of Mexico Shelf sale and the expected proceeds to be received from the Egypt partnership, we are evaluating the most tax efficient way to fund international capital investments, pay down additional debt, repurchase shares and fund capital investments in our onshore US regions. Utilizing these proceeds will allow us to further enhance our debt maturity profile, preserve our balance sheet flexibility to fund operations and growth and enhance shareholder value. This now concludes our prepared remarks and I will turn the call back over to Brady.
Brady Parish: Thanks, Tom. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram [Credit Suisse].
Arun Jayaram – Credit Suisse: Steve, I wanted to get your comments around international. I think in the press release you talked about how going forward these regions will primarily be a source of excess cash flows, and I assume that the incremental cash flows would be reinvested in North America. But how should we think about international growth going forward?
Steve Farris: Well, we would like to be able to at least keep it flat – that regions that we keep we would like to be able to either keep flat or grow a little bit. For sure we’d also like them to be able to generate significant cash flow with our capital program for the year. For Egypt, for example, I think generated about $900 million of cash flow in the first three quarters. So – and it has – and basically stayed flat.
Arun Jayaram – Credit Suisse: But Steve, by this comment, essentially you are communicating that relative to maybe Apache a year ago that you’re going to be investing more of your cash flows in North America versus internationally? Is that fair?
Steve Farris: You bet. When ‘13 ends, you will see that in 2013 and certainly 2014 – a much stronger than that.
Arun Jayaram – Credit Suisse: And my second question is for Tom. You produced 784,000 barrels for this quarter, your pro forma run rate that you show on page four of the supplement, is that 625 which is – with all the asset sales gone. So my question as we think about the fourth quarter, it would just reflect, I assume, for the fourth quarter just the Gulf of Mexico Shelf and Canadian assets and then going forward as we think about the first quarter of ’14, that’s when we start thinking about 625 and maybe some growth on top of that, as that being kind of what you do next year; is that fair, Tom?
Tom Chambers: That’s fair. That’s exactly right. Go ahead.
Arun Jayaram – Credit Suisse: And can you just quantify -- overall I know you have done several transactions in Canada, what the impact will be in terms of the fourth quarter?
Steve Farris: Depending on we still have some pending transactions it should be around 22,000 barrels a day, or thereabout equivalent a day, predominantly gas. 
Operator:  And your next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond [Simmons & Co.] 
Pearce Hammond – Simmons & Co.:  Steve, in your prepared remarks, you were talking about Canada and the ability to maybe have that asset compete with the Anadarko basin and the Permian basin assets for capital. Are you referring to your Duvernay and Montney assets and is this a foreshadow in that we should see an increased amount of CapEx for this region next year?
Steve Farris: Duvernay, Montney, also we have Bluesky and also some of our Viking stuff that we are doing, all of it going horizontal, I think we will have by the end of November we should have 12 rigs running out there, all 12 will be sideways. We will spud our first Duvernay well. We’ve got an acreage position right in the heart of the play. So we will spud our first Duvernay well this winter. The rocks looks very similar to what they look like in the Anadarko basin there, they are called something different but that whole – western sedimentary basin looks an awful lot like the Anadarko basin.
Pearce Hammond – Simmons & Co.: Do you think the economics could compete because of the – it seems like with the differentials being a little wider up there, it might make a disadvantage?
Steve Farris: Well, I would tell you North American capital is going to have to compete with each other, so our program up there is going to have to compete with the Permian and Anadarko Basin in order to get funding.
Pearce Hammond – Simmons & Co.: Great. And then my follow-up question is when you look back at the BP transaction from a few years ago where you bought some assets in the Permian and Canada and Egypt, but specifically in Permian, sort of, an after-action review on that particular acquisition. What do you feel like you picked up and how has it helped your asset base and especially in light of all the de-risking that’s going on in the Permian right now, how does that transaction look a couple of years on?
Steve Farris: Well, I’ll give you a broad overview. I mean, honestly it’s been a home run but John Christmann is sitting here, who runs our Permian and is getting ready to run all our North American onshore. So, John, do you want to comment?
John Christmann: I mean, I think when you look at – there is really two transactions, you can’t just talk about, you know, BP without talking about Mariner, both those transactions really help change our whole program, I mean, you now look we’ve got over 1.1 million acres in the Midland Basin, you know, we’ve been in a transition out there, really an evolution into – in fact, in this quarter we now have, you know, across, we’ve got more horizontal rigs running than vertical rigs and we’ve got a lot of acreage contributed from, both, BP and Mariner. So I think it’s really helped the region put it where it is today.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin.
John Herrlin – Societe Generale: Yeah. Hi. Steve, you mentioned that you had well cost savings. How much of it was hedge related and how much of it was well completion, onshore?
Steve Farris: How much is what now, John.
John Herrlin – Societe Generale: You mentioned that you hedge for wells, so just wondering –
Steve Farris: Yeah, the Tonkawa is really not been too affected by pad drilling right now because we’re just not going to that, frankly. The biggest cost savings in Tonkawa is number of days drilled and the completion cost. And the completion cost because we’re self-sourcing all our chemicals, all our sand and our horsepower now.
John Herrlin – Societe Generale: Okay. And didn’t you also mention that Permian as well or was it just the Tonkawa?
Steve Farris: No, I also mentioned the Cline. It’s many of the same thing. That is pad drilling. Certainly in the Wolfcamp in our Barnhart area. It also is associated with self-sourcing all our services.
John Herrlin – Societe Generale: Okay. Next one for me is in the Permian you built a very large organization quickly. How automated are you going to make your operations just given the fact that infrastructure is so critical?
Steve Farris: John, do you want to –
John Christmann: Yeah, I mean, I would say we have, you know, in a matter of three years, we’ve now got over 330 folks in Midland and I would stack that organization up against any. I think the thing we’ve got with the mid-40, 44 rigs running right now, when we are – you know, as I mentioned we’ve now got more horizontals than verticals, the beauty that we’ve got is, we’ve got multiple plays and that we’ve got the ability to kind of time these where we can work around our infrastructure both on the processing side as well as having facilities built for water handling, you know, the pads built and the sourcing for the fracs. So, I think it actually puts us in a position where we’ve got the ability to plan. We’ve been working on getting further ahead so we can do an even better job doing that. But I think that’s why you see such strong performance from the Permian in the third quarter and it looks good going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman.
John Freeman – Raymond James: Good afternoon. Have you all made a decision yet on when you do get those Egyptian proceeds whether or not you’re going to lead it offshore versus you lead in places like Wheatstone next year or if you bring it back and try to use your inner wells to kind of shield your tax hit?
Steve Farris: Well, you’ve pretty well outlined the alternative. Certainly, we are looking at it, you know, we’ve made some commitments to pay down debt and to buy shares back which we expect. One of the things that I said – I think I said on the last call is is that we have so more producing assets than the $4 billion which means we’re going to have to pay down the debt than the $2 billion that we paid down so far. And we also have repurchased 8 million shares, which we intend to continue.
John Freeman – Raymond James: And then my other question – looking at Australia in Australia, if I am looking at this rate, the current production there that is at is 56 million a day, which is about 60% higher than what you all said, you thought the net daily production was going to be last quarter, I was just wondering if you could add any color.
Tom Voytovich: This is Tom Voytovich. I think that we are pushing more gas through Macedon earlier than we thought we did and it’s a nameplate gas plant of 200 million, we are up to around 225 million. So arithmetic I think is fairly self-explanatory.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade [Johnson Rice].
Charles Meade – Johnson Rice: I recognize that, that if you are all ready to give guidance and talk about 2014, volume growth you would have come out and done that. But I was wondering if I could get you to talk a little bit more about how you are internally thinking about what 2014 would look like, this year. Doing some of the same math that Arun did earlier, it looks like to me that you have been having kind of year-over-year growth of around 2% and just the denominator effect from the sold volumes will get you more like 2.5%. But I think there will also be some effect from the fact that the Gulf of Mexico Shelf was declining and that might add a bit more to your growth. So is there any discussions or thoughts that you have had internally that you can share?
Steve Farris: Yes, I can’t quite – depending on how you calculate the math, the way that we look at 2014 is 2013 based on a pro forma, we should be able to increase our production growth rate for 2014. We’ve got a lot of moving parts in 2013; to peg a number it’s pretty difficult right now other than looking at it on a pro forma basis.
Charles Meade – Johnson Rice: And is there a pro forma number that you have in mind, Steve?
Steve Farris: No, we are going to have analyst day in February and we will come out with a 2014 production growth and capital plans for 2014.
Charles Meade – Johnson Rice: That will be great. I can wait till then. And then if I could follow up on the Permian, I notice that I have asked about this horizontal on the Central Basin platform you guys a few times. It seems like you are the only operator that’s really doing it. And when I look at your operations report, if I am interpreting correctly, I think you’ve got a few more in there, horizontal Wichita Albany, and horizontal Australia I think it was. And so those are quite impressive wells and they look like they have had great economics. And am I right in that and how does this stack up with some of the more industry wide plays that are happening in the Midland basin?
Tom Voytovich: I would say you are exactly right and those are, three of our wells right now are some of the best economics we’ve got in the region for sure. The beauty we’ve got is having a big position on the Central basin platform, we’ve got a lot of assets, we’ve got areas where we can go in and target and use horizontal drilling, and we’ve done it quite successfully. And we have been doing that since 2010 in the Grayburg, Squire 4 [ph], [indiscernible] and obviously Wichita Albany has been a big story for us this year. So I think the beauty of it there is you’ve got your areas where you come off of main units, you’ve got on the flanks, you’ve had units performed on paycuts and parameters that were little better than what you are drilling horizontally and it makes for really, really economic wells. But the big deal is you’ve got to have the assets in the acreage and positions in those deals and the infrastructure to drill. They are very good economics.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of David Tameron [Wells Fargo Securities].
David Tameron – Wells Fargo Securities: Hi, just back to the Permian. Can you give us a breakdown – you have -- I think it’s 45 operated rigs running, can you just ballpark that for Central, Midland and Delaware?
Tom Voytovich: We’ve got roughly 3 in the Mexico, handful of them in Central basin platform. If you look at the Wolfcamp alone right now, we’ve got about 9 horizontal wells running in the Wolfcamp, I have got another 3 or 4 in other plays down in the central – or in the Midland basin. So you’ve got over half of the rigs indefinitely in the Midland Basin and that over half of the rigs are horizontals. We’ve got a couple down in the Delaware and they’ve kind of scattered out in some other areas.
David Tameron – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. John. And if we think about, just a year ago or year-and-a-half ago when you guys had your Analyst Day you kind of rolled out what your plans were for the Permian and what you knew at that time. Looking back, any areas you’re more excited about, less excited about, kind of what’s changed, I know there’s been a lot going on the last year-and-a-half, but kind of what’s changed in the last year-and-a-half that you could summarize that for us.
John Christmann: Well, I mean, I think, you know now the – obviously there’s a lot of momentum, you’re seeing a lot of these plays are real. They’re getting more legs underneath. If you look back at what we guided to it was kind of 13% growth, I think with where we’ve been the last two years, we’ve well exceeded that. So, I think we’re very excited about what’s in front of us. I think you’re seeing the cost come down significantly as we alluded to, you know, with the use of pad drilling and the completion side and starting to go that direction you’re seeing multiple landing zones, so there’s more to be excited about today as we see that it’s starting to really prove out and we’re being able to deliver on what we said we’ll do to you back in June of 2012.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Matt Portillo.
Matt Portillo – Tudor Pickering & Co.: Good afternoon.
Steve Farris: Good afternoon.
Matt Portillo – Tudor Pickering & Co.: Just two quick questions for me. The first in regards to the Permian. I know that you guys have really focused a lot of your drilling activity, initially, around the Barnhart area for the Wolfcamp but you do have a very big footprint in Reagan and [indiscernible] and Upton in Midland County. And I was curious, as we think about the program progressing forward, especially given some industry results we’ve seen in all the various areas, how should we think about the expansion of your Wolfcamp program in the Midland Basin. And I guess, alongside that I did see that you had a very good Wolfcamp well, Loving, and I was curious how you guys are thinking about the Wolfcamp drilling program in the Delaware Basin?
John Christmann: Well, you got, you know, three different areas we’re talking about there. You know, we’re running six rigs in the Barnhart area, which is Irion County. You know, I think one of the legs up we’ve got on industry right now is we’ve probably drilled more concentrated wells in an area. So, we’re probably further ahead in terms of understanding spacing lateral lengths and really moving into development mode. So, we’ve been working hard there to understand that and actually doing a lot of field test to help us optimize wells. So, we’re excited about Barnhart, I think you’ll see us run a similar number of rigs as we start the plan for next year in that area. The one thing we’ve done this year is we’ve picked up two rigs, now we’ve got three rigs actually in Reagan and Upton. We’ve got two wells here, the Miller that are in the ops report that both are very strong wells. You know, I think an early look EURs will be north of our type curve that we put out in June of last year. And I think as you see us going into next year that will be an area where we will expand the rigs going forward as we get into those areas. The other area you allude to is in the Delaware, that actually is a third Bone Springs well, a horizontal, but it’s really close to the Wolfcamp which is why we tagged it that way. Very, very good well, you know, we’ve got some room to drill some more over there as we just kind of start to understand our Delaware position. The big difference in the Delaware and the Midland is you’ve got higher pressure, you’ve got little more water volumes to deal with over in the Delaware but right now all three programs look very, very compelling.
Matt Portillo – Tudor Pickering & Co.: Okay.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani.
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: Hey, guys, just wanted to follow-up on a comment you made regarding asset sales. It sounds like there could be some more coming from you folks, just wanted to get a sense, I mean, do you think there is anything really large are we kind of talking about small pieces of portfolio to clean up?
Steve Farris: Well, I think we’ve done the lion’s share. I think I said in my prepared remarks, we’ve done the lion’s share. We do have some other assets that we’re looking at as part of our review. And I think it’s important to note that if we can’t get good value from at this point that we probably won’t sell them but we are actively pursuing some of those.
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: Alright. I guess in terms of cost, you guys obviously talked about a concentrated effort to reduce LOE and G&A, certainly showed up in the numbers this quarter. You know any sense of continued improvement, any kind of magnets that you can give us, I mean, could we see another 5% to 10% per boe come at a cost going forward and how should we think about that.
Steve Farris: Well, I think certainly that if you look at our operating costs on the shelf, our fourth quarter operating costs are going to go down, because if you put in that much production at $21 a barrel and average that over the rest of our property base, your operating costs are going to come down. Certainly on the G&A side, obviously we’ve gone down quite a bit on the product side and also – mentioned that when we talk about our sales in Canada, that’s about 52% of our well count up there. So it wasn’t just about getting rid of the dry gas, it’s also getting rid of well count. So overall our G&A ought to continue to come down also.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jeffrey Campbell [Tuohy Brothers Investment Research].
Jeffrey Campbell – Tuohy Brothers Investment Research: I noticed in your operations supplement that you mentioned that drilling fewer wells per section is 18, to better find well performing, I was wondering if you could provide some updated spacing for acre and will this be continued throughout your Cline areas?
Tom Voytovich: Well, I mean one thing about these shales is they are homogenous. So different areas, you got to attack them different ways but we have found in the class, especially in Glassglow [ph], we are right now kind of looking at four wells per section, we are seeing better results, so it’s all a function of within that area but as you move into other areas, it changes. But I think that’s one of the advantages we’ve got as getting into some areas where we have got in the pads and drilling more laterals and get more wells down, we are going to have more data we can understand how to optimize this.
Steve Farris: On a broader scale, one thing I think that – and not just for Apache, I mean truthfully with the number of zones and the amount of oil in place in the Permian basin, we just scratched the surface. I mean I truly believe that. I think the Permian is going to have years of surprises in it, most of them are going to be good.
Tom Voytovich: Kind of follow up on that, if you take the Wolfcamp down and Barnett, we have tested four different zones in there, we’ve now placed two in the upper some would call the Wolfcamp but we’ve got a buffer, the lower portion of the upper are an upper. So there’s going to be more laterals stack in all these fields. So they will walk in on just how many per section for sure.
Jeffrey Campbell – Tuohy Brothers Investment Research: Let me ask one further question, regarding the inherent risk of all exploration wells, maybe it’s too early but I was just wondering having gotten to a 100 feet pace, that’s efficient to commercialize the well, your announcement of the follow up drill kind of on the hill, it’s very positive.
Tom Voytovich: Right, I think you can presume that we reached total depth on that well and we are about waiting selection options or evaluating options to conduction some appraisal drilling, so I think that will happen before the end of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall [Heikkinen Energy Advisors].
Michael Hall – Heikkinen Energy Advisors: I guess circle back on few things, number one, on the international production front, trying to little bit better understand that commentary about holding things flat, would that be from kind of current and or 2013 exit rate levels or should we think about that more as a flat year on year average?
Steve Farris: I think it’s important that we articulate that plant – Egypt, we made that transaction for a number of reasons. Obviously validate the value of it. But the other thing, it also gives us an opportunity to grow that region because it won’t be as big as part of our portfolio. So we can – it truly still have tremendous upside, we are drilling our first horizontal, actually we are going to drill seven horizontal wells this year but our first one is just about completed. And in the North Sea that is a matter of how much capital and how much cash you want to take out. In terms of our profile for 2014 versus 2013 more like an exit rate of 2013 than it is at average for the year.
Michael Hall – Heikkinen Energy Advisors: And I guess the other from my end is on the spending side, I am just trying to think about – what in the current, let’s say quarterly spending rate would be non-recurring, if you will or should we – you know, why would though you do not think about just taking the roughly $3 billion spent this quarter and kind of annualizing that next year?
Steve Farris: Oh, you mean your capital – annualizing capital, I’m sorry I didn’t quite.
Michael Hall – Heikkinen Energy Advisors: Yeah.
Steve Farris: You know, we haven’t allocated capital for 2014 yet. Certainly we’re very active in the Permian, the Anadarko right now but I think we got to be careful about just annualizing the third quarter’s capital numbers, that’s probably a little strong.
Michael Hall – Heikkinen Energy Advisors: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate.
Doug Leggate – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thanks and good afternoon, everybody. So, you guys gave us a pro forma production number for the quarter, I’m just trying to think in light of the strength of your balance sheet with the disposals coming in, can you give us a pro forma cash flow and CapEx number for the quarter? And maybe opine a little bit as to whether you expect to start out spending cash flow given that you’re going to have basically $6 billion of cash in your balance sheet when all disposals are done? And I’ve got a follow-up, please.
Steve Farris: Brady, you –
Brady Parish: Well, I don’t think – I think it would be premature to put out a pro forma cash flow and CapEx number for the quarter. You know we did breakdown capital by region within the financial supplement. Obviously you know the two major items that we've sold which is really the source of the pro forma number that we have in the operation supplement. So, you can assume even though ultimately we're going to – we’ll record 100% of Egypt on a non-controlling interest for the third that we don't own as the way we’ll account for it, but if you assumed a third of the capital for Egypt is not ours, we’re spinning two-thirds there and if you assume the Shelf obviously is not in those numbers, that would give you a sense for what our capital reduction would have been for the quarter. As far as cash flow, you know, Egypt is pretty easy to figure out what our cash flow is, when you look at historical financials you get a good sense for what kind of cash flow we generate there, even on a quarterly basis. And with respect to the Shelf, the one guidance we had given around the date of the divestiture when it was announced is that we were roughly going to get about $500 million of excess cash flow out of the Shelf with about $900 million of capital, so that obviously implies about $1.4 billion per year at least for 2013 that we thought we might do this year.
Doug Leggate – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: So, that’s helpful, Brady. Thanks. I guess what I’m really trying to figure out is you guys have got enormous opportunities there, obviously in the Permian. And I know you don't want to talk about 2014 guidance but historically, Steve, you’ve always talked about Apache will spend its cash flow but that was before you had potentially $6 billion on the balance sheet. So I’m just wondering should we anticipate some of those disposal proceeds accelerating some of that value? And I'll leave it at that, thank you.
Steve Farris: Well, I think, a little bit you’re seeing that this year. We're going to make the best capital decisions we can. And certainly we would like to have a growth profile for 2014 that’s stronger than 2013.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Richard Powest [ph].
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Steve, just going back to the sub-salt play on the Gulf of Mexico shelf, with the success at the Heron well, do you have a reserve estimate on that well at this point and well cost?
Steve Farris: You know we've got one well down. So, it's a little premature to talk about reserves. In terms of – the one thing I will say about that is, it is probably the next big play that’s going to come on the shelf. I mean all you're doing is taking that same rock and coming up on the shelf and looking for the same things you were looking in Deepwater, the only difference is we've got infrastructure across the Gulf because of our relationship, our negotiations with Fieldwood, we have rights to go through platforms on all those wells we drilled, including Main Pass 295. So, you should expect us to drill quite a few sub-salt wells, exploration wells, next year. And I think it has tremendous room.
Unidentified Analyst: Are you currently drilling any additional sub-salt wells?
Unidentified Participant: There are two additional rigs that are running on the shelf right now. And we will continue program at that pace probably.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Joe Magner [Macquarie Research].
Joe Magner – Macquarie Research: I was wondering if you could provide us with an updated production number for the Barnhart area.it looks like you added 10 more wells from the last update that was provided a couple of months ago and just kind of curious what the trajectory looks like there?
John Christmann: We have not come out on with anything external yet but we continue to run on active program out there. We were well above 8000 oil and gas has gone up nicely as well too. So I mean I think you will see more of that in February of next year when we walk through the analyst stuff.
Joe Magner – Macquarie Research: Just I wondered if you could give us an update on, I think the length of the well being drilled up there has moved around a little bit, just current economics and costs and well performance.
John Christmann: I think we are pretty all in line with type curves that we disclosed back in June of ’12. We have drilled some longer laterals as long as 9300 feet, where it makes sense with the land we seem to be – drill a mile and half, so we’re just kind of setting that up right now. Our well costs have come down significantly as Steve alluded to. We are well under $7 million, the mid to high 6s right now. And so – and that’s for the 7500 foot laterals.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of John Malone [Global Hunter Securities].
John Malone – Global Hunter Securities: I’ve just two quick questions about BC, any update you can give us on status of Kitimat and then on Liard basin, you talked about these 10 new wells, can you give us some idea of what the production capacity of those Liard wells are?
John Christmann: So for Kitimat, things are progressing on a number of fronts there. From the regulatory standpoint, we are currently working with BC government to work out their desire for their LNG tax scheme. We are moving forward on the environmental approvements in areas that are concerning our pipeline occurrence right away. Of course, the downstream portion is operated by Chevron, in the upstream area we are completing our conceptual engineering for the placement of facilities that will support the rental drilling program. As far as the second part of your question on the yard, the one well that we have which is a premier well which is outlined is the D-34-K well which we think is one of the most productive shale gas wells drilled to date in North America, if not the world, that well probably may cost 20 Bcf, it’s been in production now for over year and a half, it’s the current – exactly as we forecasted at the analyst day last year.
Unidentified Participant: The number of fracs are slight compared to what we will do on a development plan.
John Christmann: Exactly that particular well we only had six frac stages applied to at a very limited lateral compared to the design fracs for the wells going forward with the development plan which will be much longer laterals at a many frac stages we apply at it in Permian and Anadarko area. The 10-year program itself beginning in 2010 as we will mention more detail in February at our analyst day, is principally to hold acreage and less sulphur production, only a few of those wells like to see production in 2014 and 2014.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) There are no further questions at this time.
Brady Parish: Okay, thank you Rachel. Thank you everyone for participating on the call. We obviously greatly appreciate your interest in Apache. If you have any additional questions, please reach out to the IR department and will be happy to help you out. Thank you. Have a great day.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Rachel, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the 2Q Earnings 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brady Parish, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference. 
Brady Parish: Thank you, Rachel. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation’s second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. On today’s call, we will have three speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. I will start by giving a brief summary of the second quarter results, and then we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer; and finally, our CFO, Tom Chambers is out today so he has asked me to pinch it for him with respect to his remarks. We've prepared our quarterly financial supplemental data package for your use, which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or pre-tax margins. In addition, we have prepared an operations supplement to summarize our activities across the various Apache operating regions. These can both be found on our website at www apachecorp.com/financialinfo. Today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to defer materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website. This morning, we reported second quarter 2013 earnings of $1 billion or $2.54 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital totaled $2.6 billion. Adjusted earnings which exclude certain items that impact the comparability of results totaled $801 million or $2.01 per diluted share. In the second quarter total net production averaged approximately 790,000 boe per day with liquids production constituting 54% of the total. This represents an increase from the 782,000 boe per day reported in the first quarter and the 774,000 boe per day reported in the second quarter of 2013 was negatively impacted by a decrease in North Sea production of 6000 boe per day from the first quarter partially due to deferred production as a result of unplanned facility maintenance at the Forties Field as well as natural fuel decline in some of our other international regions. One final item of note before I turn the call over to Steve. An effort to further provide transparency with respect to our disclosure of oil and gas production we’ve included within our quarterly financial and operation supplements say more detailed breakout of net production for our Egypt region. As you can see on the bottom of pages five through seven of the financial supplement. We have provided three separate line items for Egypt production. Gross production, net production with tax which is gap and net production without tax. For the terms of our production sharing contracts the state owned petroleum company EGPC pays our Egyptian income taxes on our behalf using the share of it's profit oil. As a result for accounting purposes we record income tax with an equal and offsetting increase in our oil and gas revenues. As you can see this accounting treatment is both earnings and cash flow neutral. However it does result in Apache recording additional production volumes what we call tax barrels, because the recording of the tax barrels is both earnings and cash flow neutral we’re disclosing Egypt net production with tax barrels which is GAAP and without tax barrels for completeness. If you were to exclude tax barrels from total reported production, our second quarter 2013 net production would have been 751,000 boe per day versus 727,000 boe per day excluding tax barrels in the second quarter of 2012 which is a 3.3% increase. This compares to the 2% increase based upon our reported net production which includes tax barrels. We have included an illustration of our Apache’s production breakdown on page four of the operational supplement for your review because Egypt tax barrels introduce additional variability in our reported net production. We have included this additional disclosure in an effort to assist you and estimating production on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We will be posting a presentation at a later date that includes a detailed illustrative example of the mechanisms and accounting for a typical EPSC to help further enhance transparency. With that I’ll turn the call over to Steve. 
Steve Farris: Thank you Brady and good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. As Brady said Apache reported a strong results for the quarter, we generated over a $1 billion of earnings and more importantly $2.6 billion of cash flow from operations. I think the most important thing about the last quarter is we are transitioned towards more North American onshore growth was evidenced again this quarter with each of our four onshore North American regions significantly increasing liquids production both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, which are at attractive rates of return. As a result, our onshore North American liquids production increased to 175,000 barrels of oil per day and that constitutes 41% of our total worldwide liquids production and over 22% of our total overall production. This represents an increase of over 6% quarter-to-quarter and nearly 42% from second quarter of 2012. In addition, our onshore North American crude oil production increased to nearly 120,000 barrels a day, an increase of 26% versus second quarter of 2012 and now it comprises over 15% of our total production. Digging more, our U.S. onshore resource base continues to deliver sector leading performance. Apache is the most active U.S. onshore driller with 81 rigs currently running. During the second quarter, we averaged to combine production of 214,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day from our Permian and Central regions alone, or 27% of our total production. This represents more than a 34% increase over second quarter of 2012 and a 28% increase after adjusting for the Cordillera acquisition which we closed on April 30, 2012. In the Permian, we are currently running 45 rigs. In the Anadarko Basin, we are running 35 rigs. And as a result of this drilling activity, we remain on track to achieve our guidance of greater than 25% North American onshore liquids growth during 2013. I would like to turn to Egypt right now. During the second quarter and throughout the recent political unrest, our operations have remained uninterrupted. In fact, I traveled to Cairo, last Thursday night I was in Cairo Friday through Tuesday of turning our quarterly operational review at an opportunity meet with the new minister of petroleum in a number of new administrations who have reiterated the importance of Apache’s investment in Egypt. Frankly, it was business as usual. We are currently running 26 rigs in Egypt. This morning we announced several impressive discoveries across our vast position in Western Desert. These discoveries continued to highlight the prospectivity of our $9.7 million gross acreage position. Now, moving from the second quarter results, I would like to provide a brief update with respect to our portfolio review process. I mentioned in our first quarter earnings call after significantly both during our onshore North American asset base over last 3.5 years. Last fall, we embarked on a strategic preview of our portfolio with the ultimate goal of keeping the right mix of assets that generates strong returns, drive a more predictable production growth and create shareholder value. Since the beginning of this year, we have begun executing on multiple processes with respect to a robust list of priority divestiture candidates. On July 18th, we announced our first divestiture when we sign an agreement to sell our Gulf of Mexico shelf operations to Fieldwood Energy for $3.75 billion on cash, net of $1.5 billion of P&A liability. We also retained 50% interest in deeper rights, including what we consider exciting subsalt plays. We are moving forward on our other processes and we will keep you at price of our progress. We hope to have additional transactions announced before year end. Given the highly confidential and sensitive nature of these potential transactions, we are not going to provide any further details at this time, but we will update you as progress unfolds. At the end, we intend to use the net proceeds to be received from the disposition of these priority assets to reduce depth and repurchase shares under our 30 million share authorization from our Board. And through the end of the second quarter, we have repurchased 2.9 million shares. The share repurchase program combined with our recent increase in our dividends I hope demonstrates our continued commitment to deliver value to our shareholders and reflects confidence in the underlying value of our business. Please keep in mind all of these potential transactions and the use of the proceeds received or subject to market conditions and I want to rest assure we’re dead eye serious about rebalancing our portfolio and emerging from this process is even stronger company than we’re today. We want to continue to do what we think we do best which is export our vast inventory of opportunities rigorously allocate capital to generate great attractive rates of return and profitably and more predictably grow our production and create long term value for our shareholders. I would now like to turn the call over to Rod Eichler. 
Rod Eichler: Thank you Steve and good afternoon. We have once again compiled an operation supplement detailing our activities across all 10 of our regions. I would like to take a moment to highlight some of our activities in the Permian and Central region and in Egypt. As Steve mentioned we had an outstanding quarter drilling and completing wells across the globe and we continue to ratchet up production on our North America onshore liquid plays. During the second quarter we averaged a 116 rigs worldwide and completed 343 total gross wells with a 99% success rate, 248 of these wells or 72% were located onshore at North America. At our Permian and Central Regions alone we completed 215 gross wells or 63% of our total. Our production in North America onshore liquids grew 42% over the prior year to a 175,000 barrels per day and was predominantly by our Permian and Central regions. Combined these two regions grew liquids production approximately 8000 barrels per day quarter-over-quarter or 6% to a 136,000 barrels per day which represented nearly 32% of total worldwide liquids production. Combined production of these regions was 214,000 boe per day representing 27% of total company production for the quarter. In the Permian region we averaged a 123,000 boe per day 74% liquids constituting nearly 16% of our total production. This represents 18% production growth over the second quarter of 2012. We continue to be the most active driller in the basin holding a record 41 rigs for the quarter. We spot 214 gross wells of which 58 were horizontal and completed a 128 gross wells during the quarter. Along with Deadwood, drilling at Barnhart is down leading the region in production growth along with three bar (ph) and a Yeso Play in New Mexico. We continue to add strong results in our vertical drilling program and Deadwood and area acquired in the 2010 transaction we now have over 600 operating wells for this year in the field. Second quarter drilling activity at Deadwood focused on the vertical (inaudible) play maintain a six rig vertical Wolfwood (ph) campaign and our Lower Cline Shale Development Program. The region continued it's successful (inaudible) program on four recent vertical wells in the play averaging IPs of approximately 300 barrels of oil per day, 70% oil. The Lower Cline Shale program continues to increase inventory and results. Our 2013 11 wells have been drilled and there are 28 wells remaining for the year. Our 30 day average IP for 2013 Cline wells online through second quarter is 311 boe per day 81% oil. Currently our lower Cline inventory is spread over more than nine sections. Well spacing for (inaudible) and for 3D seismic conversion interpretations are all being evaluated to optimize the development program. Also during the quarter the Barnhart area was extremely active with key two production growing 32% on the second quarter of 2012 and averaging 4700 barrels oil per day and 13.5 million cubic feet of gas per day. We continue to run six horizontal rigs toward the upper and little Wolfcamp shale. By the end of the second quarter we had drilled 37 wells with a total 83 expected by year end. We now have a total of 26 Apache operated horizontal Wolfcamp wells producing in the field with average 30 day IP in excess of 600 boe per day. With respect to cost reductions one of our focus areas has been the conservation of water resources as frac operations have employed the use of 1.2 million barrels of recycled flow back water. After initial drill out of frac wells all flow back and produce water from the horizontal development is recycled for us in the future frac jobs thereby conserving the non-potable groundwater available in the area and reducing our overall water cost. During the second quarter we also added two rigs to our Three Bar Shallow Unit with selling and development of the Wichita Albany reservoir. A total of 7 wells spud another successful horizontal completion was added to that field. One well of note was the Three Bar Shallow Unit 113H drilled to a measured depth of 13,200 feet with a 6,000 foot lateral section. After a 16-stage frac, the well began production on May 9 and recently tested at rates of 795 barrels of oil per day and 1.3 million cubic feet of gas per day. Six additional wells are in various stages of completions, flow back and tie-in. Two vertical and one horizontal rig continue to develop the Yeso play of New Mexico. For the second quarter, 27 new Yeso wells all verticals were brought on production. Gross production for the 2013 Yeso drilling program doubled from 1,500 barrels of oil per day and 3.2 million cubic feet of gas per day to about 3,000 barrels of oil per day and 6.3 million cubic feet of gas per day during the second quarter. Completion activity on 8 horizontal wells drilled to-date should commence later in the third quarter. Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2013, Permian expects to maintain an active rig count of 45 drilling rigs of which 20 will be horizontal. Moving now to Anadarko Basin, we are in our central region we averaged 91,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. This is approximately 4,700 barrel of oil equivalent per day, or 5% increase over first quarter 2013 production, and notably 100% of the quarterly growth came from oil and natural gas liquids. Our liquids production rose 12% quarter-over-quarter to 45,000 barrels per day. Liquids now represent nearly half of our total region production versus 29% in the second quarter of 2012. During the quarter, we accelerated activity in the Anadarko and Whittenburg basins. We further exploited our vast resource potential by running an average of 28 rigs of which 27 were horizontal and completed 87 gross wells. We are currently running 35 rigs in that region and remain on track to drill 300 wells during 2013. About a third of our program will target prolific liquids-rich Granite Wash with another third targeting the oilier Tonkawa. Rigs will also continue to work the Cleveland, Marmaton, Cottage Grove and Canyon Wash plays. In our liquids-rich Granite Wash play, our wells continue to come on strong. Two recent well result highlights include the Ramp 26 #7H with an IP of 199 barrels of oil per day and 7.5 million cubic feet of gas per day the Ramp 27 #7H with an IP of 139 barrels of oil per day and 7.4 million cubic feet of gas per day. We still have many years of well locations and our resource inventory awaiting exploitation. In the oily Tonkawa play we had strong results in Roger Mills County with our three largest completions averaging over 500 barrels of oil per day and approximately 600 Mcf per day. Again, Apache has identified years of viable well locations in our resource inventory. In Ochiltree County, Texas, we have a successful Cleveland program underway with our most recent four completions coming on with an average IP of 540 barrels of oil per day and 630 Mcf per day. The Marmaton formation is also showing strong results with recent completions averaging 400 barrels of oil per day and 4.9 million cubic feet of gas per day. We are also having tremendous success in our Cottage Grove play development and the Stiles #23-3H well came online at 790 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 82% oil. In our Canyon Wash play in the Texas Panhandle, we brought on several strong vertical wells including the (indiscernible) with an IP of 1,237 barrels of oil per day and 1 million cubic feet of gas per day and the Boys Ranch 116 #10 at 984 barrels a day and 101.3 million cubic feet of gas per day. In addition, our two most recent wells are flowing back after frac at a combined rate in excess of 3,000 barrels of oil per day. We are also continuing to drive down drilling and completion cost through detailed analysis of even smallest operations. In May, we reported $5 million of drilled and completed Tonkawa well. Thanks to the efforts of a number of Apache engineers, petrophysicists and geologists. We have lowered that number by nearly $1.5 million with production results equal to or better than before. During the second quarter, we also concentrated heavily in our Tonkawa bit, motor, torque, and drag combinations. Half of the 25 Tonkawa wells drilled in the quarter had significant rate of penetration increases with our last two wells drilled in under two weeks versus four weeks six months ago. We mentioned on our last earnings call that we have lowered our average Granite Wash completing well cost by $1.3 million to $2 million per well. The same team that reduced our Tonkawa cost by nearly half is now focused on the Granite Wash, so we anticipate additional future cost savings by continuing to apply best practices we expect to reduce cost further and apply these technicians to our other plays. As Steve mentioned our operations in Egypt remain uninterrupted and we continue to find new oil and gas discoveries in the prolific Western Desert. In fact this morning we reported seven oil and gas discoveries across four basins at six concessions. Our continued success highlights a geologic and geographic diversity across the company’s 9.7 million gross acres in Egypt’s Western Desert. The discoveries include the Riviera South West-1X on the Southern Plank of the Abu Gharadig Basin which test flowed 1500 barrels of oil per day and 2.8 million cubic feet gas per day for the Lower Bahariya sand. And the Faghur basin we had four new discoveries including the Narmer-1X which encountered 85 feet of net pay in the middle of Jurassic Safa sand. The wells have flowed 1166 barrels of oil per day and 400 mcf of gas per day. Despite downtime in the North Sea we did have some positive news recently at our Bacchus field. Last month we completed our third successful development well Bacchus B1 which mobbed 257 feet of net oil pay along our horizontal wellbore and high quality Jurassic Fulmar sandstone. Production commenced from the B1 during the fourth week of July adding 9400 barrels of oil per day of new rate taking the field to 17,600 barrels of oil per day with plants to further optimize the rates and operating conditions of the subsea infrastructure. During the third quarter we planned to acquire a new treaty seismic survey over Bacchus in order to identify further development opportunities. That concludes the operational highlights. I’ll now turn the call back over to Brady. 
Brady Parish: Thanks Rod. This morning we reported earnings of 1 billion or 254 per diluted share. Overall our bottomline results reflect an another solid quarter of financial performance driven by increased production. Our production this quarter averaged 790,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Oil and gas revenues totaled $4.1 billion for the quarter flat with the first quarter; oil revenue was lower as higher production volumes were offset somewhat by a drop in the oil prices. Gas revenue was slightly higher than the first quarter as higher prices offset a slight decline in production. Oil accounted for 78% of total revenue. Including the impact at hedging second quarter oil prices averaged $97 and $0.93 per barrel down $3.79 from the first quarter our gas prices averaged to $3.87 up $0.15 per mcf for the first quarter. As a result we generated 2.6 billion of cash from operations before working capital items. We were able to consistently generate these cash flow levels given the fact that over 45% of our total production on a boe basis is oil which continues to sell for well over 20 times the price of North American natural gas. In addition our international gas portfolio is continued to bolster our realizations as our international realizations exceeded those in North America for the sixth consecutive quarter. We head the portion of our 2014 production to secure prices in cash flows that will support our continued growth through our very active drilling program. We hedge 62,500 barrels per day at WTI crude oil at almost $91 per barrel and 62,500 at Brent crude at just over a $100 per barrel. When you look at our income statement this quarter you will notice a new line item titled derivative instrument gains, losses, net. This line item represents the mark to market impact of our oil and gas commodity price financial derivatives and was segregated due to the magnitude of the amount of $247 million gain in the quarter. This line item will continue to appear each quarter as long as we have financial derivatives and be one of the components utilized to calculate adjusted earnings. Our focused drilling program produced a 42% increase in liquids production in North America onshore properties from the prior quarter and 6% increase for the first quarter. This is primarily driven by continued strong results in the Permian and Anadarko Basins although as noted earlier each of our four North American onshore regions increased their liquids production from second quarter a year ago and sequentially versus the first quarter. Worldwide liquids production for the quarter averaged 426,000 boe per day an increase of 10% from the comparative 2012 quarter and 2% sequentially. For Apache our liquids growth and drilling opportunities are primarily focused on crude oil. Over 84% of our second quarter liquids production is crude oil. Our production efforts directly translated into a pretax margin that exceeded 35%. Our operating costs for the quarter were up 5% sequentially driven by increased repair and maintenance and power and fuel costs. Typically repair and maintenance cost run higher in the second and third quarters each year as we compress this work into the favorable weather window. I also wanted to note that second quarter earnings were impacted by $59 million deferred tax expense for foreign currency fluctuations in addition to the after-tax commodity derivative mark-to-market gain of $156 million both of which are non-cash adjustments. Adjusting for these non-cash items, we were near $801 million or $2.01 per share versus $2.07 a year ago and $2.02 in the first quarter of 2013. Turning to taxes, the second quarter effective tax rate of 37% primarily reflects the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on deferred taxes just mentioned. Absent this foreign exchange movement for the quarter, our effective tax rate would have been a more typical 40%. Similarly, this adjustment impact in our percentage of deferred taxes in the quarter. We would expect the deferred rate of approximately 25% for the year absent the adjustment. Detailed calculations for margins, adjusted earnings, adjusted tax rate, and cash from operations can be found in the financial supplement located on our website. Looking at the balance sheet, our ability to generate consistent operating cash flows continues to support our robust drilling program and other planned capital expenditures. This quarter, our total debt balance increased slightly, but at the end of the quarter our debt to capitalization ratio was 28% the same as last quarter. However, as Steve mentioned earlier, we are working to rebalance our portfolio by actively pursuing asset sales to be completed in 2013. Proceeds from the first of these, the Gulf shelf sale for $3.75 billion will be used to reduce our debt including commercial paper balances and $400 million of debt maturing in September, and we purchased Apache common shares under a 30 million share repurchase program authorized by the board earlier this year. At the end of the second quarter, we took the opportunity to initiate the share repurchase program and buyback 2.9 million shares. The results of our efforts to rebalance our portfolio will enhance our debt maturity profile, preserve our balance sheet flexibility to fund operations and growth and enhance shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram. 
Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse: Good afternoon, gentlemen. 
Steve Farris: Good afternoon. 
Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse: And Steve understanding that you are not probably going to provide a lot of details, but I do want to maybe see if you could give us maybe some broad thoughts as you look to rebalance the portfolio obviously you announced the Shell, but from here will the portfolio look pretty similar to what you have today? I mean, are you thinking of more smaller types of transactions down the road or could we see something pretty meaningful where you really reduced the size of the organization to increase your leverage to the U.S. onshore properties which are growing pretty sharply? So, just trying to get your thoughts on from here what the scale of the asset sales could look like? 
Steve Farris: Well, I – thank you for the question. I think we said during our first quarter earnings call, we had a robust list of assets that we were in the process of marketing, which we still do. We have multiple processes going on at the same time. The end results of this and I have said it before, but the end results of this is we want assets that can grow or we want assets that can generate cash to fund that growth. And if you think about where that portfolio would lead you, it would lead you more towards North American onshore. The other thing we have said and I made a comment about being in Egypt and it was business as usual, I drove around Cairo for three days and it was very quiet and business as usual but we also recognize that we need to find a way to validate the value of Egypt for our shareholders and we continue to work on that also. 
Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse: And Steve just a follow-up maybe on the North Sea you commented about, you had a little of maintenance related downtime, can you give us maybe some thoughts on how the back half of the year could like in terms of production. I know that the third quarter you generally see some turnarounds and things like that but just maybe some comments on the North Sea. 
Steve Farris: The North Sea does go through, we had some unplanned downtime in the second quarter, we had some planned downtime in the third quarter. We have a turnaround schedule, our production will be down a little bit from the second quarter and then our expectation for the fourth quarter is to be considerably stronger than the rest of the quarters of the year. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond. 
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Co. Int'l: Steve how should we think about total company production growth for on the divestiture the Gulf of Mexico Shelf in the past, we’ve talked about kind of total company production growth of 3% to 5% then of course that included the shelf. So how should we think about that moving forward? 
Steve Farris: And that’s a very good question and it really, when we come out of the other side of this when depending on how much we get done this year we still have the a large portfolio or a pretty robust portfolio things we would like to divest up. When we get through with that what we will see is by it's nature that our North American onshore will become a bigger part of our portfolio so we would expect our future growth to be stronger than our 3% to 5%. 
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Co. Int'l: And then my follow-up is just a little bit how do you feel like you’re progressing right now on the Wolfcamp currently and do you think there is an upward bias to the 350 million boe resource potential figure that you put out last year at the Analyst Day because it looks like you got some attractive acreage shelf over in Upton County and a little bit Midland County and Martin County as well where some other operators have had some good wells. 
Steve Farris: I’m going to let Rod talk about the detail. So one thing I would say and for the most part we had a presentation back in June of 2012 where we did some tight curve. For the most part we have exceeded those tight curves in the Wolfcamp, in the Deadwood area and the Cline et cetera. But as Rod pointed out we have six rigs running, we continue to be very active there. 
Rod Eichler: We have 45 rigs currently operating as a Permian we have about 20 of those rigs were operating in the southern half of the Midland basin. Big concentration in Deadwood and Barnhart where we have a strong acreage concentration which I talked about but we have a lot of other blocks of acreage in Midland County area and I have some other operations I mentioned some results just in the last day or two, we have acreage in the cities, in fact we have two wells are currently drilling and testing offsetting some of those results that were just recently announced and we have great expectations, we continue to the success on the Wolfcamp. We’re targeting two different landing zones in the middle Wolfcamp across the area. 
Steve Farris: I think to answer your question in broad terms you will probably see our resource potential in the Wolfcamp from what we put on June of 2012 we’re going to have an analyst day later this year probably in the fourth quarter but I think you will see those resource potentials in the Wolfcamp go up from where it was. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Bob Morris. 
Bob Morris - Citigroup: Steve you last quarter mentioned a full year budget of $10.5 billion that you’ve increased  activity in both the central region and the Permian. What has been the impact on the budget apples-to-apples. I know there was some associated with the couple of Mexico shale but on an apples-to-apples basis what is the impact on that $10.5 billion from the increased activity seen on sort of North America. 
Steve Farris: Well at the present time we’re running at a pace would outpace that a little bit but we intend to gauge our capital program with our sales proceeds and also our cash flow. We are also ahead a little bit on our cash flow. 
Bob Morris - Citigroup: So, that $10.5 billion apples-to-apples maybe goes up couple of hundred million or $500 million for the increased activity, source it elsewhere and (indiscernible). 
Steve Farris: Honestly, probably the higher number. 
Bob Morris - Citigroup: Okay, alright. 
Tom Chambers: And I will tell you honestly, I mean, we are talking about we are at the end of July. So, we still got five months of activity level yet, so… 
Bob Morris - Citigroup: Alright, thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin. 
John Herrlin - Societe Generale: Yes, hi. Quick one for you, Steve, in terms of the reconstituted Apache, conceivably could you be more like 70% on conventional and the rest conventional given the added North American focus? 
Steve Farris: That’s a pretty strong number. I would say this Canada has to be a part of our portfolio going forward. We are in the Permian. We are in the Anadarko Basin. We are re-looking and doing a resource assessment in our Canadian region. We should start seeing some results of that in the next couple of weeks internally, and we’ll make that presentation in the fourth quarter or at the Analyst day, but what we would like to have is three areas in North America that is predominantly unconventional. I doubt if we ever get to the 70% range, but it certainly will be a bigger part of our portfolio. 
John Herrlin - Societe Generale: Okay, that’s fair. Next one from me and last one is your Permian well reserves you are giving 30 days what would the IPs be, because it looked like in the Central region you were giving shorter-term IPs and not 30 days. So, I was just wondering how these wells started? 
Rod Eichler: I believe that we use 30 day IPs across the board unless we say otherwise. That goes in the Central region as well as the Permian. 
Steve Farris: Obviously, Rod, yes, the initial 24-hour test would be, I don’t want to say significant, it would be certainly quite a bit larger than what our 30-day IPs are. 
John Herrlin - Societe Generale: Okay, thanks. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett. 
Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein: Hi, good afternoon. Any update on Kitimat and we still in some of the LNG projects? 
Steve Farris: Wheatstone continues to move forward. We are finally getting in a range, where the end of 2016 isn’t that far off. So, one thing I would say is is that based on our models and our partner’s models, when that comes on, it will pay out in 4.5 years of all our costs and it will generate about over $1 billion a year net to Apache. So, as we get closer to that time it becomes more and more interesting. The Kitimat project frankly is we are going through a supplemental FEED with Chevron. Chevron has now taken over the operations of the downstream. We are operating the upstream. We had a meeting with our Chevron counterparts last week and went through a number of things. The predominant one was marketing, and although I can’t talk specifically about it, they are high and behind the marketing side. Obviously, marketing is going to drive this program. 
Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein: Great, thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman. 
John Freeman - Raymond James: Good afternoon. On the Central region, you announced a group of pretty solid Canyon Wash wells and I know that Rod, you mentioned that you are still sticking with the same game plan of third-year rigs on the Granite Wash, a third at Tonkawa, and a third in these other areas, and I am just curious if maybe not this year, but next year if Canyon Wash just based on the fact it appears to be pretty strong results, a lot oiler than some of these other plays if that might start to get some incremental rigs as its in the least developed of your central region properties? 
Rod Eichler: Of course, it’s a new property for us having just started this discovery about two years ago. We have about 35 rigs operating in that region by year end. Well, probably one or two rigs continue to operate in the Bivins Ranch area. It’s a vertical program. We drill the wells relatively quickly. We anticipate drilling into a water flood opportunity that exists in that (inaudible) field in the very near future. But we’re very pleased with the results we have seen to-date. 
Steve Farris: Yeah we have about 130,000 acres there and I think they are actually going to drill a horizontal well in there fourth quarter this year. Number of operators on either side that are experimenting with horizontal wells. 
John Freeman - Raymond James: And just one follow-up from me, in the Permian another pretty good Wichita Albany well, can you remind me I know you’re adding rigs there, what sort of the running room is there. Is that present across majority of your central basin platform acres, is it isolated into one area? 
Rod Eichler: In the three bar unit area we have probably about two dozen locations that we’re currently exploring. It's been a very robust program to-date and we’re just now been able to step out in other blocks of acreage we have in the same county to see if that same kind of high potential exists on those other acreages we have. 
Steve Farris: I think the most interesting thing about a number of other operators and ourselves is that the future of the Permian is still an emphasize, because it is a tremendous amount of oil in place there and you see quarterly and including ourselves trying new ideas and going horizontal in new plays and you really have a real tremendous potential continuous to be in the Permian basin that is untouched. People haven't even thought about it yet. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate. 
Doug Leggate - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch : I’ve got two, one is on Egypt and the another one is maybe a little bit off the wall but the way things to Permian but. On Egypt, Rod there has obviously been another stream of tremendous success over there it's obviously not getting any purchase at the market currently given the situation but can you just tell us today as things stand how do you see the running room, the scope for additional growth and following your conversation Steve what is the risk that you see any changes, the tax regime or anything has really threatened your operation as thing stand today. And I’ve got a follow-up. 
Steve Farris: All that Rod talk about the what our running room is in terms of our operational position and then on my comment on our view of what’s happening in there from a political standpoint. 
Rod Eichler: Yeah Dough we’re clearly running 26, 27 rigs in Western Desert. We anticipate drilling a similar program in 2013 probably about 2075 wells as we had 2012 so the program level of activity is continued to pace for the previous years, pre-revolution. Our gas production as an example is it's record levels. In fact we have some facility constraints our gross operating production is running about 920 million cubic feet of gas per day and in the second quarter we managed to finally put on the 24 inch pipeline from Abu Gharadig to Dashur which we have been working to restore to it's original operating parameters when it was held by BP and we now have half that line, half of the capacity being put into service. So we anticipate to continue the same kind of program with a good prospect inventory and the every year we show this at Analyst Day presentation as the inventory both drilling and then completion opportunities as well as work over opportunities it seems to be no change in the actual amount of the inventory grown going from year-to-year even though we continue to grow 300 wells and do well over 1,000 work overs and rig completion opportunities every year. 
Steve Farris: And I'm going to prep with this with the comments that, we've recognized the uncertainty and how our shareholders view Egypt and we're working on how to validate that. Having said that I will say this and I have said it many, many times. Egyptians are Egyptian first and Arab second and I think if you see what's going on currently you get a pretty good picture of that. I mean they want stability in terms of our position in Egypt we met with the Minister of Petroleum, we met with the Minister of Investment, we also met with the Minister of Industry and Trade and met with a number of business people over there that I have met over a period of years with the US-Egyptian Business Council. The importance to Egypt of Apache or the importance of Apache being in Egypt it is very big. We are the most active driller. We drill more wells than everybody else combined in the Western Desert. And I say this and it’s a factual statement and I understand the uncertainty, but from the way we see it, would it be very difficult for Egypt to change our tax regime or change our position, because we are their oil growth in Egypt going forward. 
Doug Leggate - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: I appreciate the answers, frankly, my kind of off the wall follow-up, so today one of your competitors, I guess smaller competitor Pioneer announced another stream of strong well results in the Permian stocks up significantly. I am just curious as to whether you would ever consider separating your Permian business as part of your broader portfolio, if you are given the value that’s not been recognized in your portfolio that has been recognized elsewhere? And I’ll leave it that. Thanks. Like I say it’s a bit off the wall. 
Steve Farris: Yeah, truthfully, I think we are getting good value for our Permian assets. I think it needs the Permian and the Anadarko and some of the other things we are doing needs to be a bigger part of that portfolio, and that’s what we set out to do. And honestly, we are (indiscernible) serious of doing that. 
Doug Leggate - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Alright. Okay, fine. I will leave you there. Thanks. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Allman. 
Joseph Allman - JPMorgan: So, Steve your comment about validating the value of Egypt that seems to imply some kind of monetization, could you just give us some color on that? 
Steve Farris: Well, there – obviously I have said those words a number of times and I have answered that question a number of times. There is a number of ways I think to validate the value of Egypt. Obviously, one of which is monetization, one of which is, if you look at the gamut, you could spin it out, you could list part of it, you could sell part of it, you could sell all of it. The most important thing about Egypt is it generates a tremendous amount of cash flow. And we just need to figure out a way to validate that value without giving up that value. 
Joseph Allman - JPMorgan: Got you. Do you think if you sold a small slice of Egypt, would that cause investors to value the whole asset using the same metrics based on selling a small slice? 
Steve Farris: Well, I think that would be, beauty would be in the eyes of the beholder honestly. 
Joseph Allman - JPMorgan: And in terms of the option of selling the whole thing, I mean is that really an option? I mean could you sell it or do you think there would be buyers out there with the government budget? 
Steve Farris: Well, we are getting in an awful lot of detail, but one thing I would say is that in fact I went to Europe with Brady the first part of June. The rest of the world has a different view of the events in Egypt than folks in the United States. Europeans and other parts of the world have a different view of Egypt. They see truthfully a little less risk there than U.S. investors, but not saying the right or wrong or the U.S. investor is right or wrong, that’s just – that’s a perception. 
Joseph Allman - JPMorgan: Got you. And then on other area, so the media seem to get it right in terms of the shelf, I think the media reported that you are going to sell a minority interest in the shelf and you end up selling the whole thing. The media also reported that you are going to sell the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and those reports came out even earlier. So, how do you view that deepwater Gulf of Mexico, it’s a newer asset for you, how do you view that in the context of the overall portfolio in terms of returns and predictable growth and your ability to add shareholder value? 
Steve Farris: Well, we have said we have a robust list of assets that we might think are more valuable in somebody else’s hands than our own. And we also want to get more predictable and consistent growth. We also have a number of large capital items weed stone being one and kitimat being another. I mean obviously we need to look at that and see how it fits in our portfolio. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade. 
Charles Meade - Johnson Rice: Going back to the Permian in Mid-Continental areas, do you have a sense of how much you might be able to ramp your activity there from current levels before you started to run into above ground issues or organizational issues? 
Steve Farris: Well it depends on which one you bid. Certainly the Central region, right now we're 10 rigs behind the Permian and we could continue to ramp up there. We can continue to ramp up in the Permian Basin. It's a little and I use the analogy it's like when you have to add a new foreman an appeal I mean you get 16 pumpers in a field and then you got to add a new foreman. So I am not sure where that line is in terms of what it takes from an organizational standpoint to make a step change to add another foreman if you understand my analog. 
Charles Meade - Johnson Rice: I think I do. 
Steve Farris: But certainly we could ramp up from here. 
Charles Meade - Johnson Rice: Got it. Okay, in both those areas in both the Permian and Mid-Continent? 
Steve Farris: Yes. 
Charles Meade - Johnson Rice: Okay, great. That's exactly what I was looking for. And then if I could also just try to follow-up a bit on the questions that Joe Allman was asking, do you have a preference on the assets sales that you are pursuing? Do you have a preference for a complete exit from an area or an asset versus a sell down of selling the percentage of what you hold? 
Steve Farris: No different assets in a different way. So, there may be some that we have partners and there may be some that we have a complete access. 
Charles Meade - Johnson Rice: Got it. So, not an across the board preference but it is asset-by-asset? 
Steve Farris: Right. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani. 
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets: Just yet another follow-up on the asset sales. Obviously it looks like you're going to be able to pay down all of your short-term debt with the shelf sale and you're clearly buying back a lot of stock as well. If there are large incremental asset sales where should we expect the proceeds to be directed here? Would it be even more stock buyback or potentially accelerating drilling in the areas like Permian and Central area? 
Steve Farris: I think it's important to note that the more assets that we sell whatever in terms of that are cash flow generating assets. It requires us to pay down more debt in order to keep our A rated and we intend to keep our A rated. So you may see more debt, but you'll have more proceeds. And then that will either depending on our, as we look in the future, it will either buyback additional shares or reinvest it in the business. 
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And I guess in terms of some of your other kind of more fledging areas exploration stuff. Any update on Inland or Alaska or shale’s in Argentina? 
Steve Farris: Yeah. The Cook Inlet in Alaska. In fact we’re getting ready to do some work 3D seismic. Frankly, we were disappointed in the well results that we have there. We drilled the well and actually got too close to a fault (ph) so we really didn't evaluate that well. I am personally still very positive about the Cook Inlet. Obviously we're directing cash to different things right now. So, we've slowed down that activity but in terms of its prospectivity, I still think it has good value. What was the other question? I am sorry. We have drilled or participated in four or five Bakken mode of (ph) wells. We drilled a couple of horizontal wells ourselves that were very short laterals. That area is politically challenged right now. What we have decided to do is spend our cash flow that we generate there. And so, we are pretty slow in actually continuing to evaluate the (indiscernible). 
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer. 
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Good afternoon. 
Steve Farris: Hi Brian. 
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs: I wanted to follow-up on the running room topics on Egypt and the North Sea, because I think one of the challenges unrelated to political risk is assessing the impact on production growth of the discoveries that you regularly announced. If you look at production in both areas itself sequentially and I think in the update you highlighted in part declines in Egypt from new and legacy wells. So, I think the question specifically on Egypt since you touched on the North Sea earlier is what should we expect for oil production trajectory over the next few quarters? And can the discoveries that you have announced here drive growth or just reverse the declines that we have seen on a gross basis in the last couple of quarters? 
Steve Farris: Yes, I think it’s – and Brady went through that the makeup of our production there. And it’s very important to start being able to articulate that because under GAAP what we have to do is report tax barrels, but tax barrels is just a gross up of the revenue line and a gross up of the expense line on the tax side. In order to really look at our growth, because what we do in our plan for the year is we just use last year’s percentages and try to roll them into this year’s plan, because you don’t have any other data to go by. And it plays havoc with really talking about what our percentage growth is, which is why we have worked hard over the last couple of quarters. And that leads into my next point. If you look at our gross operated production, which is where you start in Egypt, our gross operated operation is basically flat for the year. If you look at our net because of the differences in the tax barrels, our production has been down which is why we are trying to make sure we articulate what is happening in Egypt. Right now, we are spending enough money to grow slightly our gross operated production. And it truly is a function of how much capital you want to spend, because with the opportunity set is still very robust. And what we have done right now is we are spending capital enough that we think we can grow gross operated production slightly for the year. 
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs: Got it. And is that going to be maintaining an equal mix of oil and natural gas or do you expect a further shift to more towards natural gas here? 
Steve Farris: Yes, we are about most of the things that we are drilling right now are oil. 
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs: Great, thanks. And then on a follow-up on the Cline shale you talked about your 30-day IP rates, can you just put into context how the Cline competes in your portfolio relative to the Wolfcamp shale and the Mid-Continent? 
Steve Farris: In terms of rate of return, Brian? 
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs: Exactly. And in terms of rate of return, how you think about where the next dollar of capital goes in the U.S. onshore? 
Steve Farris: Well, probably the Cline shale right now, because we are still – if you are talking about horizontal wells, vertical Clines are very economic. Horizontal wells are 20% – honestly, 20% rates of return. If you look at the things we are doing in the Anadarko Basin especially with any kind of oil at all, the rate of returns are in the 30%, because we are ahead of the game in terms of reducing our cost against our benchmarks in the Anadarko Basin than we are in the Permian Basin. We are still on the learning curve in the Permian Basin, Brian, but the Wolfcamp shale is its 30% rates of return. 
Rod Eichler: Our Wolfcamp development is also 18 months further developed in the Cline. And just in terms of share numbers and the things that we are doing out there, we are still learning a lot in the Cline. Our results are very good, but we are not as mature there as we are of our knowledge or the understanding of Wolfcamp shale in the same area. 
Steve Farris: And In fact I said on the European Roadshow, I mean throw us in that broader patch, I mean I can't name another company that can get cost down and production up like this outfit can and this is perfectly example of doing that. If you look at our Tonkawa wells we were, last year we were making about an 18% rate of return and we were $1.5 million more. This year you take out a $1.5 out of that cost side it's over 40% rates of return in Tonkawa. So, it's purely a margin game and I think we can play that game very well. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall. 
Michael Hall: I just want to make sure I’m thinking about the kind of go forward 2013 production outlook correctly, let’s get in the moving pieces. If I have to just hold the U.S. Gulf, the shelf assets let's say flat from the second quarter levels. Will that be with the 3% to 5% growth target that you spoke about previously this year, still be a fair target? 
Rod Eichler: Well I think in the Gulf of Mexico flat it's probably not a good assumption frankly. If you look at on a pro forma basis, where you would to take the Gulf of Mexico shelf operations out of the forecast for '13 and then do the same thing for '12. We projected that we would have a double-digit decline in the Gulf of Mexico shelf so therefore the 3% to 5% would obviously have been a higher number if you did on a pro forma basis. I think that's probably the right way to think about it. 
Michael Hall: I guess I am trying to understand the go forward pieces and how those are progressing well for the prior plan which maybe you will be able to walk through maybe through the key areas. It sounds like North Sea is down third quarter coming back up until fourth, Egypt we just walked through maybe it's around through some of the other? 
Rod Eichler: Yeah I think when you look at the third quarter we’re not going to give specific guidance, but if you look at the onshore North American plays that we’re doing, I would suspect that the third quarter growth would be fairly consistent with what we experienced in the second quarter with the goal obviously the guidance we've reiterated at 25% greater than 25% North American onshore liquids growth. When you look at the offshore Gulf of Mexico including the deep water and you also look at Australia, we had guided earlier in the year that they would be down roughly double-digits. So, I think that's the right way still to think about them, even though the shelf hopefully will close by September 30th we won’t have them in the fourth quarter. And then I think with the North Sea, Steve had already mentioned that we expected to be down in the third quarter a little bit because of the turnaround. You are going to have offsets because of wells coming on production, some of which we announced recently including the Bacchus well today. But you know that turnaround at the 40 field turnaround, on average for the quarter we expect it to be down 10,000 to 12,000 boe per day even though it will happen in the month of August; the average would be about 10,000 to 12,000 boe per day down. As a result of the turnaround but that's what we've already got built into our plan. 
Michael Hall: That’s helpful and then if I could just follow-up in terms of Canada what you're doing of those assets perhaps just a little additional color kind of maybe what the underlying decline of the legacy activity looks like and how quickly you think you could turn that into a growth program with any of these new targets you kind of alluded to? 
Steve Farris: Well I think we have two things going on in Canada. One is we have got our transition into more of an unconventional play up there. And then we got to look at our legacy assets and decide what to do with them. And we're in the process of doing that frankly. We would like that region to come out is in a position to be able for 2014, being in a able position to be able to grow and adding a meaningful growth area for us in North America onshore. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of (inaudible). 
Unidentified Analyst: Steve, just a couple of questions regarding the deep shale for the subsalt in the Gulf of Mexico, I note that you retained half your interest there, what are the near-term drilling plans related to the subsalt play? 
Steve Farris: Actually, we have two wells that we are drilling as we speak, and it will be a continuing part of our portfolio. If you think about it in terms of reserve size to cost, we also have an agreement that we have a facility right on the current HBP acreage that we sold to Fieldwood, so that we can take them through those platforms. The two prospects that we are drilling right now, I think the un-risk predicted or expected reserves on one is 104 million barrels and the other one is 136 million barrels. And we are not down on either one of them, but that’s – so when you think about what the infrastructure costs that you are foregoing and the reserve size that you are looking at, you have a real potential across that shelf to make that subsalt play. 
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And if I remember correctly, you are involved with a 3D shoot in the Central Gulf of Mexico, is that still ongoing? 
Steve Farris: It is. We have a wide seismic shoot going on and that we won’t have the results to the latter part of this year, actually the end of this year the actual process data, but we are continuing to shoot. 
Unidentified Analyst: Alright, thanks very much. 
Brady Parish: Hey, Richard, we do provide a little bit of detail on Main Pass 295, which is one of the wells that Steve is alluding to within our ops report. 
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. 
Brady Parish: As we go into the Gulf of Mexico shelf, there is a little paragraph on it. 
Unidentified Analyst: I appreciate that. Thank you. 
Operator: And I am showing that we have no further questions at this time. 
Brady Parish: Okay, excellent. Well, thank you very much for participating in the call, and again, if you have any additional questions, don’t be shy reach out to us, and we’ll be happy to help. Thank you. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation first quarter 2013 earnings release conference call. [Operator instructions.] At this time I would like to introduce your presenter for today Mr. Brady Parish, vice president of investor relations. Mr. Parish, you may begin your conference.
Brady Parish: Thank you operator. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation's first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. On today’s call, we will have four speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. I will start by giving a brief summary of the first quarter results, and then we will hear from Steve Farris, our chairman and chief executive officer; followed by Rod Eichler, president and chief operating officer; and finally, Tom Chambers, executive vice president and chief financial officer. We've prepared our quarterly financial supplemental data package for your use, which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations, or pre-tax margins. In addition, we have prepared an operations supplement to summarize our activities across the various Apache operating regions. These can both be found on our website at www apachecorp.com/financialdata. Today’s discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A further disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website. This morning, we reported first quarter 2013 earnings of $698 million, or $1.76 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $806 million, or $2.02 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations totaled $2.4 billion. In the first quarter, total net daily production averaged approximately 782,000 BOE per day with liquids production comprising 53% of the total. This represents an increase from the 769,000 BOE per day reported in the first quarter of 2012 and a decrease from the fourth quarter as we had guided on our year-end earnings call. Production in the first quarter was negatively impacted by 8,000 BOE per day of deferred production due predominantly to three cyclones, which impacted production in Australia and third-party gas plant downtime in Canada. This downtime was expected and incorporated within our full year guidance. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Steve. 
Steven Farris : Thank you, Brady, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Apache did report solid financial results for the quarter. We generated over $800 million of adjusted earnings and $2.4 billion of cash flow from operations.  I think of particular note, we generated outstanding production growth in our North American onshore regions at very attractive rates of return. Our onshore North American liquids production averaged 165,000 barrels of oil per day, which constitutes 21% of our total worldwide production, and is an increase of 6% quarter over quarter and nearly 45% versus the first quarter of 2012. In addition, our U.S. onshore asset base, which we bolstered over the last three year, continues to deliver sector-leading performance. Apache is currently the second most active U.S. onshore driller. During the first quarter, we averaged 206,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the Permian and central regions alone or 26% of our worldwide production. This represents a 50% increase over the first quarter of 2012, and a 40% increase if you adjust for the Cordillera acquisition. In addition, our central region in the Anadarko Basin grew production almost 9% from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the first quarter or nearly 36% on an annualized basis and increased liquids production over 28%. We’re currently running 42 rigs in the Permian Basin, 28 rigs in the Anadarko Basin, and so we expect this level to continue. Our exceptional onshore liquids growth was offset primarily by the deferred production that Brady mentioned in his opening remarks, a decrease of 5% in North American natural gas production, as we chose not to drill any dry gas wells during the first quarter, and some natural declines in fields in some of our international regions. As Brady pointed out, we’ve already incorporated these deferrals and declines into our plans and we remain on track to achieve our full year guidance of 3% to 5%.  I’d like to move now from our first quarter results and provide more detail on the portfolio review that I mentioned in our year-end conference call. Just over three years ago, we set out to expand our portfolio in areas that we believed could generate profitable growth. With this goal in mind, we significantly strengthened our onshore North American asset base through acquisitions in the Permian, Anadarko, and Western Canadian sedimentary basin. We also entered the deep water Gulf of Mexico and added tactical extensions to our Gulf of Mexico shelf, North Sea, and Egyptian asset base. Importantly, during this timeframe, we significantly grew our production by almost 200,000 barrels a day, with 162,000 barrels a day, about 198, 82%, coming from North American onshore. Now that we’ve reached the end of this three-year effort, we’ve spent the last several months evaluating our expanded portfolio to determine which assets to keep and which assets might be more highly valued by others. Having been in the oil and gas business for 50-plus years, this is not the first time Apache has gone through this process. The sole purpose of this review was to determine which assets make the most strategic sense for us to go forward with in order to continue to do what Apache has always done best: exploit our best inventory of opportunities, rigorously allocate capital to generate attractive returns, profitably grow our production, create long term value for our shareholders. With this single focus in mind, we developed a fairly robust list of potential asset sales and monetizations that we believe will achieve our goal and expect the initial phase of this process to generate about $4 billion of proceeds.  Over the last four months, we’ve been actively engaged in a divestiture and monetization process for certain of these identified assets. Our goal is to complete this initial phase during 2013 and we intend to announce transactions as agreements are in place. As we finalize transactions, our priorities will be, with respect to the proceeds, first to pay down $2 billion of debt, then allocate proceeds received above $2 billion to repurchase shares.  Given the current level of our stock price, our board has authorized Apache management to repurchase up to 30 million shares, or approximately $2 billion of stock based on today’s share price. This share repurchase, combined with recent increases in our dividend, demonstrate our continued commitment to deliver value to our shareholders and reflects confidence in our long term strategy and underlying value of our company. Given the highly confidential and sensitive nature of these transactions, we’re not going to provide any specifics at this time. Please keep in mind all of these transactions and the use of proceeds received are subject to market conditions. However, we are confident that given the number of items that we have on our list, and assuming commodity prices hold, we should be able to deliver on this plan. I’d like to note that we have not incorporated any material adjustments from dispositions in our annual production guidance for 2013. Some of the assets we are considering have limited production while some have a meaningful amount of production. So it would be premature to modify our guidance until we gain more clarity on the results of the various processes. Finally, I want to reiterate something that I’ve said many times. We’ve build this company by focusing on returns, balance, and long term profitable growth and value creation. We are cognizant of the frustration our investors feel regarding our stock price performance and current value. We are shareholders too. Rest assured we are focused on optimizing our portfolio and emerging from this process an even stronger company than we are today, one that can continue to do what we do best: exploit our asset base to generate profitable production growth and increase shareholder value over time. Now I’ll turn the call over to Rod Eichler, our COO.
Rod Eichler : Thank you, Steve, and good morning. For the second straight quarter, we have compiled an operations supplement for your use, which highlights our activities by region during the first quarter. We received a very positive reaction to our first report, and we have incorporated many of the comments we received in an effort to further improve it, and we hope you find it useful. As Steve mentioned, we had an outstanding quarter drilling and completing wells, in particular in our North American onshore liquid plays. During the quarter, we averaged 119 rigs operating worldwide and drilled 412 total gross wells, of which 402 were development wells, with 355 of these wells, or nearly 90%, located onshore in North America. These wells were drilled with a success rate of 99%. In the Permian and Central regions alone, we drilled 263 gross development wells, or 65% of our total. Our production growth in North American onshore liquids of 6% during the quarter was driven predominantly by our Permian and Central regions.  Combined, these two regions grew liquid production 10,000 barrels per day quarter over quarter, or 9%, to 129,000 barrels per day, which represented nearly 31% of total worldwide liquids production. Combined production from these regions was nearly 206,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, or over 26% of total company production for the quarter. We have truly hit our stride in these two liquids-rich regions.  In the Permian region, we produced 119,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter, 74% liquids, constituting over 15% of our total production. This represents more than 20% production growth over the first quarter of 2012.  We further exploited our 3.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent in net resource potential by running an average of 37 rigs and drilling 187 gross wells, 36 horizontal, with 100% success rate. We continue to have great results in our vertical drilling program and in many cases our well performance is better than expected, especially in plays such as our Midland Basin Fusselman play in which recent 30-day [IP] rates for several wells have averaged over 300 BOE per day, 83% liquids, with only a $1.6 million drilling and complete cost. We are currently running 17 horizontal rigs out of a total of 42. As such, we are still on track to drill 180 horizontal wells during 2013. We have built upon our successful horizontal drilling programs of 2012, and ramped up activity in our Wolfcamp shale and Cline shale developments. We are currently running seven rigs in the Barnhart Wolfcamp shale play in Irion County and four rigs in the Deadwood Cline shale play in Glasscock County, with excellent results. During the first quarter of 2013, we drilled 17 Wolfcamp wells in our Barnhart area; eight wells are currently on production while the remaining wells are in the process of being completed. The expected 30-day IP rate per well is more than 500 BOE per day, or 86% liquids. In the Deadwood Cline shale play, nine wells were drilled during the first quarter, three wells are currently on production, while the remaining wells are in the process of being completed. The expected 30-day initial production rate per well is over 400 BOE per day, 72% oil.  We have moved into full development mode in our Barnhart and Deadwood programs, and have successfully driven down drilling and completion costs by more than $1 million per well, in an effort to further optimize our returns.  We’ll achieve this by reducing our drilling days, primarily by optimizing bit selections and mud programs, among other improvements, and applying best practices on the completion side by substantially reducing our frack costs to self-sourcing, optimizing frack designs, and taking advantage of synergies from pad drilling and frack bonds. These achievements will have a substantial economic impact when spread across thousands of horizontal locations in our inventory. We expect to further reduce these costs as we continue to optimize our operations. In the central region, we produced 86,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. This is a 7,000 BOE per day, or nearly 9%, increase over fourth quarter of 2012 production. Just as significantly, we increased our liquids production by 28% quarter over quarter to 40,000 barrels per day. Liquids now represent over 46% of total region production versus 27% in the first quarter of 2012. During the first quarter, we accelerated our activity in the Anadarko and Whittenburg basins. We’ve further exploited our 5.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent net resource potential by running an average of 25 rigs, 24 of which are horizontal, and drilling 78 gross wells. We are currently running 20 rigs in the region, and remain on track to drill 300 wells during 2013. About a third of our program will target the prolific liquids-rich Granite Wash, with another third targeting the oilier Tonkawa. Rigs will also continue to work the Cleveland, Marmaton, Cottage Grove, and Canyon Wash plays. In our liquids-rich Granite Wash play, our wells continue to exceed expectations. The first six wells that were drilled on production for at least 30 days in 2013 averaged IP rates of nearly 1,500 BOE per day, consisting of 760 barrels of liquids, of which 291 barrels are oil and 4.4 million cubic feet of gas. We still have over 22,800 identified well locations in our resource inventory awaiting exploitation. In addition, our oily Tonkawa play also had outstanding results. Our first seven Tonkawa wells drilled and on production for at least 30 days in 2013 averaged IP rates of 662 BOE per day, which included 420 barrels of oil, 103 barrels of NGLs, or 80% total liquids. These production rates have substantially exceeded our original expectations. We still have nearly 2,800 identified well locations in our resource inventory. Finally, we have expanded our Cottage Grove oil play with our recent Beckham County, Oklahoma Simmons 3-30H well, achieving a 30-day IP rate over 1,900 barrels of oil per day and 1.8 million cubic feet of gas per day. We plan to drill over 20 Cottage Grove wells during 2013 and we are in the process of quantifying our resource potential in this prolific oil play. Similar to the Permian, we are beginning to realize the benefits of scale development in this region. We have been able to drive down drilling and completion costs substantially as we accelerate activity. By implementing new drilling techniques and completion designs, we’ve been able to drive down Granite Wash costs by $1.3 million to $2.0 million per well. And Tonkawa costs, by $1.5 million per well versus last year. By continuing to apply best practices, we expect to further reduce costs by applying these techniques to our other plays in the region.  Finally, I wanted to briefly comment on operations in the North Sea. Having successfully integrated the barrel operations into our North Sea region, we are beginning to bear the fruit of our increased activity. During the first quarter, production from the North Sea increased 79,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 87% oil, 85,000 BOE per day increase over the fourth quarter of 2012. We remain on track for mid to high single digit annual production growth for 2013.  In addition, we are still on plan to install and commission the [fast] topside and complete acquisition of our 3D seismic survey [unintelligible] and drill a total of 27 wells in the North Sea during 2013. Of particular note, we just announced our first well in the satellite Tonto field, about 2 km east of the Forties Bravo platform. The Tonto-1 well came online at an initial production rate of over 10,300 barrels per day from the [unintelligible], the result of successfully applying our recent seismic conversion process and by our geoscience team to delineate the field. This is the third new oilfield brought on in the Forties area within the last three years.  That concludes the operational highlights, and I’ll now turn the call over to Tom Chambers. 
Tom Chambers : Thanks, Rod, and good morning everyone. I’ll repeat one more time, this morning we reported earnings of $698 million, or $1.76 per diluted share. Overall, our bottom line results reflected another solid quarter of production revenues and cash flows. Our production this quarter averaged 782,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, our second-highest quarter ever. Oil and gas revenues totaled $4.1 billion for the quarter, of which nearly $3.3 billion, or 79% of the total, was oil revenue. Strong first quarter oil prices enabled us to generate $2.4 billion of cash from operations before working capital items. We’ve been able to routinely generate these cash flow levels given the fact that over 53% of our production base is oil and liquids, and that oil currently sells for over 20 times the price of North American non-GAAP. Our focused drilling program produced a 45% increase in liquids production in North America onshore properties from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by outstanding results in the Permian and Anadarko basins, as you just heard Rod indicate. Worldwide liquids production for the quarter averaged 416,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 9% from the comparative 2012 quarter. A key point worth emphasizing is that not all liquids are created equal, a fact that was driven home with the significant fall in NGL prices from year ago levels.  For Apache, our liquids growth and drilling opportunities are primarily focused on crude oil. Over 85% of our first quarter liquids production is crude oil. In addition, our international gas portfolio has continued to bolster our realizations as natural gas prices in North America trailed our international realizations by 11% in the first quarter. For the fifth consecutive quarter, international gas price realizations outpaced those in North America. Although realizations in Egypt were down after the loss of a legacy Egyptian oil linked contract that expired at the end of 2012, Australia and Argentina realizations continued to increase, reflecting the impact of new sales contracts. Our production efforts directly translated into a pre-tax margin that continues to exceed 30% on a BOE basis. Our operating costs, while higher than we’d like, are a derivative of our product mix, with oil and offshore properties generally more expensive to operate than natural gas properties. With 53% of our first quarter production oil and liquids, and approximately one-third of our production located in offshore areas, our costs per BOE run higher than many of our competitors. I also wanted to note that the first quarter earnings were impacted by a $31 million after-tax unrealized loss on derivative instruments as well as a $42 million noncash after-tax writedown of our Argentina oil and gas property balance. This was the result of two concessions expiring in the next two to four years, both of which we are currently in discussions with the government to extend. Adjusting for these noncash writeoffs, FX impacts, and deferred tax adjustments, we earned $806 million, or $2.02 per share, down $0.98 from the first quarter of 2012, a period where we saw record oil prices and down $0.20 on a sequential quarter. These adjustments also impacted our effective tax rate for the quarter, which was 46%. If you adjust for items mentioned above that impact the comparability of results, our tax rate would have been a more typical 43%. Detailed calculations for margins, adjusted earnings, adjusted tax rate, cash from operations, can be found in the financial supplement located on our website. Turning to the balance sheet, our ability to generate consistent operating cash flows continues to support our robust drilling program and other planned capital expenditures. This quarter, our total debt balance remained relatively unchanged, and at the end of the quarter, our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 28%, the same as last quarter. However, as Steve mentioned earlier, we’re working to rebalance our portfolio by actively pursuing asset sales to be completed in 2013. The proceeds of some of these sales would be used to reduce our debt, including the $900 million of notes that mature this year.  The first of these sales was completed in February. As you are aware, we completed a transaction with Chevron Canada to jointly build the Kitimat LNG facilities and develop the shale gas resources in the Liard and Horn River basins of British Columbia. The net proceeds to Apache from the transaction were $405 million. The results of our efforts to rebalance our portfolio will enhance our debt maturity profile, preserve our balance sheet flexibility to fund operations and growth, and enhance shareholder value. Finally, one last important item to highlight this quarter. In February of this year we announced that our board of directors increased the regular quarterly cash dividend 18% to $0.20 per share, which demonstrates our confidence in our ability to continue to deliver future growth and shareholder value over the longer term. This increase follows the 13% increase in 2012. That concludes my remarks, and I’d like to turn the call back over to Brady. 
Brady Parish : Thank you, Tom. That concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator, we are ready to open the line to questions. 
Operator: [Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company : I guess my first question is you mentioned joint ventures. Is that separate from the $4 billion? Or is that included in that $4 billion worth of divestitures?
Steven Farris : That would be included, but the proceeds have to be cashed, if you understand what I’m saying. 
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company : So it is included?
Steven Farris : Yes. 
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company : Then you mentioned the $4 billion of the initial phase, does that imply that there’s a second phase beyond the $4 billion?
Steven Farris : Well, what I can say is the asset list that we have generated at today’s prices, and what our market expectations are, would exceed that $4 billion. 
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company : Then my last question is, I think the share buyback plan is a great idea, especially given how cheap the stock is. I guess I wondered why not use the full $4 billion to buy back the stock, rather than pay down the debt, because you have a very good balance sheet?
Steven Farris : Two things. One is we want to make sure we retain our flexibility and our A rating. The other one is that it also gives us financial flexibility to invest that money in our ongoing business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harry Mateer with Barclays.
Harry Mateer - Barclays :  You just touched on it, but perhaps if you could just highlight for us again the importance of single-A ratings, and [unintelligible] S&P for your long term vision for the company. And then second, the $2 billion of debt reduction, as you mentioned, you have $9 million of short term debt. Where does the other $1.1 billion of debt reduction come from? 
Tom Chambers : The other debt reduction comes from we’re going to pay off some commercial paper.
Harry Mateer - Barclays : And what was that commercial paper number at the end of the first quarter?
Tom Chambers : End of the first quarter, it was $619 million.
Harry Mateer - Barclays : And then on the single-A ratings? That is of importance to you guys longer term?
Steven Farris : We’ve historically tried to be finally fiscal, and we want to continue that. It’s given us great flexibility over the years, and we continue to think it will give us flexibility in the future.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Amir Avif with Stifel Nicolaus. 
Amir Avif - Stifel Nicolaus: A clarification on the repurchasing of shares. Will that only begin after you have the first $2 billion of asset sales done, or will you start doing that again at the current share price, given where it is?
Steven Farris : Our first priority is to pay down debt. And we would have a goal to get that done this year, the $4 billion.
Amir Avif - Stifel Nicolaus : Okay, so only after you have the first $2 billion, then we’ll start buybacks? That’s fair?
Steven Farris : Yeah, we want to give ourselves a little flexibility.
Amir Avif - Stifel Nicolaus : And then a follow up question on Egypt. The free cash flow you’re generating in Egypt, are there any restrictions on moving that money back to the U.S., outside of repatriation tax?
Steven Farris : No. We move it in all of our international regions.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.   
Bob Brackett – Sanford Bernstein : Following up on theses asset sales, is Kitimat included in part of that $4 billion target, or is that already done and finished?
Steven Farris : It’s not in the target. Obviously we’re going to have to size Kitimat as we go forward. Right now we are in a position to have taken something from raw materials to wholesale, and there will be a time when it will be retail.
Bob Brackett - Sanford Bernstein : And then I understand you don’t want to talk about the specifics of what potentially is for sale, but can you lay it out in terms of you prefer international versus domestic sales? Is it gas versus oil? Is it production versus acreage?
Steven Farris : I think what we said in our release is that our goal is to come out of this with assets that we think have the potential to grow long term or short term, and that we also have assets that have great generating power to fund those programs.
Bob Brackett - Sanford Bernstein : Not sure that answers the question. Is it looking for assets that are mispriced by the market, where you keep the stuff that’s undervalued, and you trim the stuff that’s potentially overvalued by the global market?
Steven Farris : No, we have an asset base that are growth generators, and we have assets that are cash generators. We want to balance our cash generators with our growth generators.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James. 
John Freeman - Raymond James: Sorry to keep beating the same dead horse here, but just to clarify on the last question, when he asked if the $400 million you got from the Kitimat transaction, that’s not included in the planned asset sales that you’ve got? So you’ll be doing $4 billion above and beyond the $400 million you got from Kitimat?
Steven Farris : That’s correct.
John Freeman - Raymond James : And then just a follow up on a question that Pearce asked earlier, on the JV front. So when you view things in terms of, it would have to be cash, does that mean if you did any JV that had a drilling carry, that joint carry would not count towards your asset goal?
Steven Farris : That’s correct.
John Freeman - Raymond James : Okay, and then on Alaska, are you all still on schedule to complete that first onshore well in the second quarter?
Steven Farris : I’ve got to check when the timing is. I don’t know when the timing of that is.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale. 
John Herrlin – Société Générale Americas Securities: How tax-efficient will the sales process be? Have you thought about that?
Tom Chambers : We have. And it all depends on what the assets are that we sell.
John Herrlin - Société Générale Americas Securities : In terms of a strategic change, does this mean you’ll be reducing your expiration exposure at all?
Steven Farris : Well, certainly if you look at our portfolio today, we’re still going to have a joint venture group that has an exploration bent. But in terms of the amount of funding that they get for the next two or three years, it’s going to be less than they’ve gotten in the past.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eliot Javanmardi with Capital One. 
Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One: I apologize for splitting hairs here, but just want to make sure I’m clear. Are these share buybacks, if things go well, do you expect to have it completed this year, in 2013? Or could we expect it to kind of start in the second half and then perhaps just lead into ’14?
Steven Farris : Well, the share buybacks will be obviously opportunistic. We have a goal to have asset sales of $4 billion by the end of this year, and the first $2 billion are going to pay down debt, and the next $2 billion are going to buy back stock. What the timing of the stock buyback is, based on how soon we get the transactions done and closed, and have the cash available.
Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One : You talked about your composition and how it helps you right now. What are you guys targeting, do you think, as far as maybe after you go through this process, initially, and perhaps in another phase, where do you like to be portfolio-wise on your composition mix?
Steven Farris : I’m not following the question, sorry. What will the company look like? What will the assets look like?
Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One : The production [unintelligible] oil and gas mix, kind of what would you be targeting still, close to a balance of 50-50?
Steven Farris : Yeah, we intend the portfolio balance to stay relatively the same.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles Meade - Johnson Rice : Looking at the region-by-region production in your earnings supplement, I noticed that one thing that stands out to me is Egypt oil volumes were down about 12,000 barrels quarter over quarter. And I’m curious if you could characterize what that is. Is that natural decline? Or was that some facilities related downtime? And give some guideline on what you expect for the rest of the year there.
Steven Farris : We’re going to try to do a better job of our guidance on Egypt going forward. If you look at the numbers, our gross production was down 2%. And the most important thing to look at in Egypt is cash flow, frankly.  But what we’re going to try to do in the future, and I don’t want to confuse everybody on the line, is we’re going to start showing, basically, net of tax. Because Apache is not responsible for the tax in Egypt, and we basically gross up the volumes for the effective tax rate. And it adjusts numbers.  If we had done it on a net basis, it would have been down about 5,000 barrels a day, or 6,000 barrels a day, rather than 12,000 barrels a day. So we’re going to try to clean that up going forward. In terms of the actual production decline, the 2% on the gross, that’s more timing than anything. 
Charles Meade - Johnson Rice : That’s great clarity. I think I understand you. That just kind of introduces some noise that’s not really there. On the flipside of that, I’m also looking at the NGL production you had in your central region in the U.S., and that almost doubled, up 10,000 barrels a day quarter over quarter. And I’m curious, is that just well performance? Or is that also some midstream issues and perhaps ethane rejection that was going on in Q4? Those ethane volumes coming back in Q1?
Steven Farris : No, that’s just well performance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Magner with Macquarie.
Joe Magner - Macquarie Capital : I’ll take another stab at the thoughts or the framework around the asset sale program. With the goal of repaying assets [unintelligible] to drive the near term and long term growth, what should we think about in terms of the growth potential of what could be retained relative to the current five-year, 6-9% growth objective. Is it going to be higher? Lower? Willing to comment?
Steven Farris : It’s premature. We have an asset list that exceeds our target. And how we approach that going forward in the next few months, or six months, will really determine what comes out of the back of it. I’d be premature to answer that question right now. Our whole goal is to be more profitable and more predictable growth.
Joe Magner - Macquarie Capital : And on Kitimat, could you provide us the updates on the [offtake] agreement discussions? And then also, whether there’s a plan in place to exercise the pipeline right away that’s outstanding?
Steven Farris : Well, with respect to to the market, obviously we are in the market. We’re in the market now with our new partner, Chevron, who is leading that charge. Before we got into the current relationship, it was pretty strong then, and I would venture to say, with Chevron as part of the partnership, it is stronger today.  In terms of the pipeline right of way, we’re proceeding forward on all those issues.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Allman with JPMorgan.
Joe Allman - JPMorgan : In terms of the asset sales, when you made the list of non-core assets that made up that robust list, what are the parameters that defined, for you, the non-core assets? 
Steven Farris : Whether they had long term growth potential, short term or long term growth potential, or do they generate significant excess cash. That’s it. 
Joe Allman - JPMorgan : Was rate of return one of the parameters? Lower relative rate of return?
Steven Farris : Well, yeah. I think if you look at those raw definitions of which ones are on either side, rate of return is our primary focus. So it would fit those categories.
Joe Allman - JPMorgan : And then when you guys sit around and think about the stock’s underperformance relative to the group, to what would you attribute the reason for the underperformance?
Steven Farris : I think two things. I think we haven’t done what we said we were going to do in 2012. And I think that as we get further into the process with Egypt in terms of the continuity of Egypt, I think that will help. We’ve got 26 rigs running in Egypt. We continue to get paid every day. It generates a tremendous amount of cash. And I think over time people will get more comfortable with that.
Joe Allman - JPMorgan : And when you look at the underperformance of the stock, are you focused mostly on over the past year or so, are you focused on underperformance over a longer period of time?
Steven Farris : No, if you look at our stock performance truthfully, through 2010, it’s been very competitive with any of our peer companies. If you look at 2011 and 2012, we’ve really digressed.
Joe Allman - JPMorgan : Is a lot of the problem just concerns about Egypt, do you think? The market’s perception, with the headline risk about Egypt? Do you think that’s the reason for the underperformance?
Steven Farris : Well, I think you can make your own assessments. We think that has some impact on our stock price.
Joe Allman - JPMorgan : And then lastly, just the process, have you opened data rooms yet in the asset sales process? And why not define the assets at this point? What is it about the process that makes you just want to keep the assets you want to sell confidential or secret?
Steven Farris : Well, we have a pretty broad asset list, number one. Number two, we started the process about four months ago, and I think the best thing we can do is do it, and then announce it, as opposed to advertising what we’re doing as we go forward, both from a competitive stand and from a market standpoint.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs : Steve, you’ve never been shy about opportunistically acquiring assets from the majors or others. Are you as interested as you have been in acquisitions that can improve predictability of growth? And does the resulting stronger balance sheet open up that opportunity? Or are you going to be more focused on the assets that you have?
Steven Farris : We’ve had this discussion before. I think companies, people, go through lifecycles, and right now our lifecycle is to give us a portfolio that we can grow organically. We certainly have been very successful in the acquisition market. That’s not one of our focuses at the present time.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs : And we’ve seen volatility in Apache’s production, which has been in part a function of a number of items, weather, other disruptions. Yet you mentioned earlier you’re interested in having more predictable growth. Would the assets that you’re planning to sell have reduced the volatility that we’ve seen in production, say in the first quarter of 2013, or in 2012?
Steven Farris : Long term, what we want to do is have a more predictable growth profile.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs : And I guess if you look back on, let’s say the last quarter and the last year, and the assets that you’re looking to sell, if we would have sold those a year ago, year and a half ago, would that have made that more predictable, less volatile? 
Steven Farris : When we announce what we are going to sell, then we can have this discussion.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs : And then lastly, just a single asset question. In your Permian Basin update, you mentioned a couple of strong Wichita Albany wells that had some pretty good rates. I just was wondering if that’s an area that you see running room in what the production mix is between oil and gas and natural gas liquids.
Steven Farris : Yeah, Wichita Albany is largely oil. We do have some running room in that area. Those wells have been, like a lot of the wells in the Tonkawa in Oklahoma, those Wichita Albany wells have far exceeded our expectations. We’ve got wells that make 900 barrels a day and are still making 800 barrels a day. It’s been a very good play for us. And we do have running room in that play.
Operator: [Operator instructions.] Your next question comes from the line of [Kyle Rose] with RBC. 
[Kyle Rose] - RBC: How should we think about Egyptian gas prices for the rest of the year?
Steven Farris : I think Egyptian gas prices, that number will be the same number going forward really forever. That is our gas price now. And the reason is, and I’m sure you’ve heard this before, we had a gas contract that rolled off at the end of 2012 that was one of our higher-priced gas contracts in Egypt. That’s the last one of those kind. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. 
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I apologize, I was a little late getting on the call, so I hope none of these have been asked. My first question, I guess on the portfolio high-grading, or the asset sales I guess you could call it, there’s been a lot of chatter about the Gulf of Mexico discoveries being in that package or in that process. And I guess my question isn’t so much about is that true or not, but it’s really more about your philosophy on exploration and bringing longer-dated projects… You know, you make a discovery, it’s a five year out to development type of situation, is your decision to go down a more aggressive asset sales route impacting your view of exploration as a kind of core strategy for the company?
Steven Farris : I think if you look at our portfolio today, from where it was in 2010, we have now invested in the [Wheatstone] project, which is a long term project that is basically oil-related. It will come on in late 2016 and effectively be 35,000 barrels of oil a day for 20 years. That’s about 270 million barrels of oil production.  So if you look at our long term projects that we have, we’ve got 50 Bcf in Liard that is associated with our Kitimat project. Those are long-lead items that take capital, that also provide steady future revenues for years to come. So in terms of what we look at selling, are the things that have high cost right now, that have lumpy production in the future. 
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Are you happy with the balance? Because obviously these up front long term large projects are dilutive to your core goal, which is I guess return on capital. So are you happy that you’ve got the right balance of short term and long term currently? Or do you see that as…
Steven Farris : We do right now, because Wheatstone, we have 13%, we’ve got one more year of capital associated with it, and frankly, with Wheatstone, we’ll just have to see how that goes. We haven’t reached FID yet with Kitimat, and we’ll have to make that decision when we get there.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And I guess my follow up Steve, and I know this comes up a lot, and I apologize in advance, but Egypt, I think they just had their credit rating downgraded by a third party earlier this morning. It doesn’t seem to be getting any better. And I guess when you think about discount rates applied to your cash flow, which obviously operationally things are going well, but the value doesn’t seem to be [unintelligible]. Is there any updated thought as to how you address the exposure issue? Is it just getting too big a part of the portfolio, given the escalating risk profile? Or are you still happy to hold things as they stand currently?
Steven Farris : Well, I think you’ve got to look at the results. They have gone through a number of quarters now, and almost two years, and we continue to be very profitable there. We continue to think that that will level out over time. My opinion is, Egyptians are Egyptian-first, and then that part of the world. We were just there a month and a half ago, and I feel very good about the forward plan in Egypt. How we convince our U.S. investor base that that is the way it is another matter. 
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Should we think about Argentina as being been a long term part of the portfolio?
Steven Farris : Truthfully, Argentina’s got a lot of great resources. Right now they’re troubled politically. How that fits in our program long term we’ll just have to see.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Amir Avif with Stifel Nicolaus.
Amir Avif - Stifel Nicolaus : A follow up question on the Permian sequential growth. It was a little slower this quarter. Is that just due to the facility downtime? And can you just [inaudible] you might be running into there’s in the Permian, as you start wrapping up activity?
Rod Eichler : Yeah, we had some facility downtime, but we also had some capacity constraints. As we’ve been ramping up our drilling activity and associated production volumes, we’ll be out in front of the ability to hook up the wells and move products out of there. There’s about a 2.5% on the first quarter.
Amir Avif - Stifel Nicolaus : And that should be alleviated by Q2? 
Rod Eichler : That will be an ongoing challenge throughout the year.
Amir Avif - Stifel Nicolaus : And a follow up question, if you could give us an update on your drilling of your acreage in the Miss Lime and the Bakken?
Steven Farris : We have not drilled any wells in the Bakken, nor the Miss Lime, in this last quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harry Mateer with Barclays.
Harry Mateer - Barclays : A follow up on my earlier questions about the debt reduction. You mentioned $900 million of short term debt, and then $600 million change of [CP], but that gets you to a little over $1.5 billion. So if I could just ask a minor point on how we get to the $2 billion, is it because you think you’re going to be slightly free cash flow negative through this year, so you’ll add some debt? And then that will be paid down? Or is there something else that I’m missing?
Tom Chambers : Typically what happens in the first half of the year is when we get off to a quick start, which we have this year, in all of our regions, we usually run a little cash flow negative for the first half, and that’s our plan. We’re actually tracking on that now, so we’ll be able to pay down some debt, [unintelligible] will come from that.
Harry Mateer - Barclays : So relative to first quarter debt balances, debt reduction is not going to be quite $2 billion, it will be less than that? Is that fair? Because it’s going to go up a little bit next quarter? 
Tom Chambers : Yeah, based on balance, that’s correct.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Nathan Churchill of Societe Generale 
Nathan Churchill - Societe Generale: Just back on the asset adjustments, wondering if there are any particular constraints that you have in the portfolio as far as investing some of this additional cash that you have coming in. I know your share price has been a little bit depressed, and I think the buyback makes sense, but just wondering how you think about weighing the buyback versus maybe increasing capex, and also if you’ve considered maybe an MLP of the assets if they’re high cash-generative and low growth.
Steven Farris : I will tell you, in terms of the share buyback, I think, from a board standpoint, and from a management standpoint, we find ourselves in a unique position, because we have relatively high commodity prices, at least on the oil side, and our stock has got a lot of upside in it. So I consider stock buyback [an event], but this is a very good event to buy your stock back. I can assure you, we have, over the last several months, looked at a number of combinations of an asset base that we want to come out of this going forward. 
Nathan Churchill - Societe Generale : On the buyback, it wasn’t really explicitly said, but are these shares cancellation?
Steven Farris : We have no one in here that answers that question. [laughter]
Nathan Churchill - Societe Generale : Okay, maybe switch gears for a second. Can you give us some insight as to what you’re seeing on the service cost side? Has it hit an inflection point as service costs started to bottom, domestically that is?
Steven Farris : I think as we all learn, not just Apache, but I think as our industry learns ways to reduce cost, I think service costs will continue to come down for a while. I don’t think we’ve hit the bottom yet, for all kinds of reasons, because of the different ways you’re sourcing things now, and the different services major service companies provide versus what they used to provide. That’s all changing, as I’m sure you’re aware.
Nathan Churchill - Societe Generale : Of course. And there is the learning curve benefit and then there’s the actual price of the curve, so I was just trying to tease out how I should think about the moving pieces there.
Rod Eichler : Well, drilling rates in the Permian Basin, for example, have been increasing since 2008. However, the curve is flattening. If you look at the day rate increases, the increased from 2012, to what we’re seeing in 2013, it’s only about a 5% increase on average for the 42 rigs we’re running out there. So we’re starting to see that curve starting to turn over. Rig availability is not an issue. As I mentioned in my remarks, we have a large number of programs in place to reduce costs in all elements of drilling and completion. In fact, some of the cost reductions have been rather dramatic that we’ve experienced in the last 12 months through these efforts.
Operator: And at this time, presenters, there are no further questions. Do you have any closing remarks?

Operator: Good afternoon my name is Ally and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instruction) in order to make sure that everyone has a chance to ask a question, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question,(Operator Instruction). At this time I would like to introduce your presenter for today Mr. Brady Parish, Vice President of Investor Relation. Mr. Parish, you may begin your conference.
F. Brady Parish: Thank you Ally, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation's full year and fourth quarter 2012 earning conference call. This morning we reported 2012 earnings of $1.9 billion or $4.92 per diluted share, adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results totaled $3.8 billion or $9.48 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations totaled $10.2 million. On today’s call, we will have three speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. First, we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer; and finally, Tom Chambers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We've prepared our quarterly financial supplemental data package for your use, which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or pre-tax margins. In addition, new for this quarter, we have prepared an operations supplement to summarize our activities across the various Apache regions. These can both be found on our website at www apachecorp.com/financialdata. Today’s discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A further disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Steve.
G. Steven Farris: Thank you, Brady, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank all of you for joining us. Apache achieved some new milestones in 2012 and first of all, despite significant downtime we grew our average annual production to 779,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, almost 5.5% above 2011 if you adjust for dispositions, which is a new record for Apache. And as a matter of information, and I assure you not an excuse, I would like to point out had we not experienced the unplanned downtime in the North Sea and Hurricane Isaac in the Gulf of Mexico during just the third quarter. Our production growth would have been 6.3%. More importantly, during the fourth quarter, we averaged 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, the first time in our company's history which establishes a strong base as we enter 2013. And despite as Brady pointed out, despite much weaker North American natural gas prices, our balanced portfolio enabled us generate $10.2 billion of cash flow consistent with 2011. I'd also like to point out, driving this impressive cash flow were our liquids revenues which constituted 81% of our overall $17 billion in revenues for the year, and North American natural gas accounted for only 11%. By the end of the year, we had fully integrated our Midcontinent North Sea portfolio expansions and we really hit our stride in our large Permian position. As a result, we built operational momentum heading into 2013. We have become the most active Permian basin player with 38 operated rigs and we plan to increase our horizontal rig fleet to half of our total operated rigs during the year. We've also become a leader in the Midcontinent liquids and oil plays, increasing our horizontal drilling activity from six rigs at the beginning of 2012 to 25 today. At the end of the year, we advanced the Kitimat LNG project by increasing our interest to 50% and expanding our strategic relationship with Chevron, so we believe this is the financial and technical LNG wherewithal to complement on our upstream strength, and it should help us accelerate our plants to monetize the over 50 Tcf of natural gas that we have in Liard and Horn River, importantly at the oil-linked prices. I am sure all of you have noted in our earnings release this morning, during 2012 we replaced 156% of our production before revisions. Excluding property acquisitions this replacement ratio would be 131%. Low prices in Canada for natural gas during the year was a predominant driver of the negative revision of 299 million barrels of oil equivalent, in fact it’s over 90% of that number. With this transition behind us, we’re going to move into 2013 with our initial capital budget set at $10.5 billion which is essentially flat with a 2% year-over-year from 2012. Our capital allocation for 2013 really reflects our choice to deliver competitive near-term performance while building balanced long-term value for our shareholders. Approximately $4 billion of our capital would be invested in Onshore U.S., but we expect production to grow in excess of 20%, 2013 driven primarily by our Permian and Central Region drilling programs. We also project our North American oil productions to grow by 14% in 2013, which was up from 12% in 2012. Furthermore our 2013 planned costs for $2.2 billion investments in ten long year infrastructure projects which represents nearly 21% of our total 2013 capital. As a result of this capital allocation choice and taking into consideration production declines in certain of our regions we expect total production to grow by 3% to 5% in 2013. Just for comparison purposes, and using our budgeted economics, if we instead use this long-term capital investment to fund additional drilling in the Onshore U.S. our projected 2013 growth rate would be in excess of 6%. Based on our current ownership of these long-term projects, these projects are expected to contribute 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day over the next five years and over 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent by the end of the decade. As a result of our two major LNG projects, production for our development pipeline is expected to continue to increase over 200,000 of oil a day before settling into a zero decline multi-decade plateau. We have built this company by focusing on returns, balance and long-term value. Over the last three years, we have deepened and strengthened our portfolio. We now have over 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent unbooked resource in our Permian and Mid-Continent positions. That is second to none. We have a robust project pipeline in motion that will provide a stable base of free cash flow for decades and we have broad exposure to quality resource and exploration opportunities around the world. On a broader and deeper footprint, provides us the opportunity to optimize our portfolio. And as such, we are in the process of identifying approximately $2 billion of asset rationalizations to be completed during 2013. We're not in a position to get into specific details at this time, but having acquired $16 billion of assets over the past three years, and strengthening our asset base, we have been in the process of reviewing our overall portfolio. We are here for one purpose and that is to generate long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. And we truly believe we can continue on that mission. Finally, another important item of note is that last week our Board approved increasing our common dividend by 18% from 17% to $0.20 per share. This follows our increase from 2012 of 13%. We remain confident in Apache's ability to continue growing profitably and see dividend growth as an important component of shareholder returns. So with that, I’ll hand it over to Rod Eichler, our COO.
Rodney J. Eichler: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon. As Brady previously mentioned, we have compiled an operations supplement for your use which highlights our activities by region during the fourth quarter. We have put this together in an effort to be responsive to feedback we have received and hope you find it useful. In this supplement, we have provided detailed operational information for the fourth quarter. We also like to highlight some of our most notable achievements during 2012. Firstly, with our growth in the U.S. onshore sea drilling. Combined, our Permian and Central regions grew production nearly 24% year-over-year and represent 25% of Apache's total global production by the fourth quarter and 197,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As impressive as these results are the reality is we're just in the early stages of our growth as each region evolves in a full-scale development. In the Permian Central alone, we have identified over 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent of resource potential to further fuel our liquids-rich gas and oil production growth to unfold. In addition, we are in the process of completing our resource assessment in Canada for liquids-rich gas and oil opportunities with approximately 7 million gross acres in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. We anticipate identifying thereby in several thousand economic wells in our various plays which should allow us to add another North American onshore growth region as we ramp up activity over the next couple of years. We also successfully integrated the barrel properties into our North Sea region. We have spent the last year preparing for drilling campaign that will test new opportunities based on the first 3D seismic acquired over these fields since 1998. Finally, we replaced over 130% of our production through drill bit and approximately 156% when you include the acquisitions; this obviously excludes the impact of later revisions, which primarily resulted from weak North American natural gas prices during 2012 versus 2011. Looking ahead, I want to focus the remainder of my remarks on our plans for this coming year. Our plans are based upon our initial $10.5 billion allocation of capital, which Steve has mentioned; includes $2.2 billion for the long-term projects, not expected to generate production till 2014 and beyond. In 2013, we expect our U.S. onshore regions to grow production in excess of 20%, predominantly consisting of liquids growth. We also expect our investment to increase production in North Sea and our drilling program in Egypt to increase our gross production in that region. However, we expect moderate production declines in Canada and Argentina, double-digit declines in Australia and deepwater due to the future timings of our next development projects coming on line and a double-digit decline in the Gulf of Mexico shale due to natural fuel declines. We're currently running 122 rigs worldwide and expect to average a similar amount over the course of the year. We plan to drill more wells in 2013 than 2012 in an estimated total of nearly 1,600 wells. Almost two-thirds of all planned wells will be drilled in the Permian and Anadarko basins of the U.S. and are expected to generate fully loaded after-tax rates of return in excess of 20% at planned commodity prices. Our financial supplement posted on our website out lines Apache's 2013 initial exploration and development capital allocation by region on Page 10. Now turning to our region highlights; the Permian region produced nearly 118,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter with 74% liquids constituting nearly 15% of our total production. In addition, we replaced over 260% of our production in the Permian through drilling activities during 2012, excluding price realizations and ended the year with 800 million barrels of proved reserves. In 2013, we'll further exploit our vast 3.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent net resource position with plans to drill over 700 wells running on average of 34 rigs and investing nearly $2.4 billion of capital. We will significantly ramp up our horizontally activity in the basin. We are currently running 13 horizontal rigs at a total of 38 rigs and anticipate increasing our horizontal rig count to 17 by the end of the first quarter. As such, nearly 180 of the 2013 wells will be horizontal versus 104 horizontal wells in 2012. We will build upon our successful horizontal program in 2012 by increasing our Wolfcamp shale and Cline shale developments, and will be focused on driving down drilling and completion costs as we move towards development mode to further optimize our returns. We have already successfully donated 10 horizontal plays across the region. This year we will target and test an additional 20 horizons. In the Midland basin, we will continue our successful vertical program in the Fusselman, Wolfwood, and Wolfberry plays within Deadwood and other areas. On the Central Basin platform, we plan to drill additional Grayburg, Clear Fork and Wichita-Albany, all those horizontal wells and to test Strawn and Mississippian zones. For the Yeso play in Southeast New Mexico, we will continue to drill vertical wells, once again our first horizontal program in the Cedar Lake area. And in the Delaware Basin while we already have successfully drilled the second Bone Spring horizontal, we plan to test in the first quarter and also drill a horizontal well in the Wolfcamp. We will be actively testing the vertical Wolfbone within this emerging area for us. Finally, since we see the number of questions regarding our Permian realizations, I wanted to mention that we successfully negotiated a five-year contract to sell crude that is then transported to the Gulf Coast via pipeline. Terms of this contract are confidential, that should allow us to receive favorable placing for this oil. These volumes will ramp up over the next several quarters and at a full capacity we will sell up to 20,000 barrels of oil per day into the Gulf Coast. Turning to the Central region, the region produced approximately 79,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. This is a 9.6% increase over third quarter of 2012 production, over 38% on an annualized basis. Just as significantly, we increased our oil production by 24% in the fourth quarter versus third quarter to 21,000 barrels of oil per day, which represents 27% of total region production. Total liquids production increased by 24% to 31,000 barrels of oil per day or approximately 39% of total region production. Further, we replaced over 340% of our production in the Central region through drilling activities during 2012 excluding price revisions and nearly 645% when you include the acquisitions. For 2013, we will continue to accelerate activity as we plan to ramp up our drilling across our extensive acreage position in the Anadarko and Whittenburg Basins. We will further explore our vast 5.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent in that resource position with plans to drill nearly 300 wells, up from 192 wells in 2012, while running in average of 29 rigs of which 28 are horizontal and investing nearly $1.4 billion in capital. About a third of our program will target the prolific liquids-rich Granite Wash, with another quarter targeting the oilier Tonkawa, rigs will also work the Cleveland, Marmaton, Cottage Grove, and Canyon Wash. Apache has 11 lower Marmaton tests planned in 2013 with a total of 90 resource locations identified. 17 vertical Canyon Wash wells are currently planned for 2013, with expectations that we will commence water flooding in the Wash and begin a horizontal program in the Canyon line later in the year. After integrating our Cordillera acquisitions and further donating our acreage over the past year, we expect that it will drive down drilling and completion plans and costs as we optimize our development program. In our Gulf Coast onshore region, we intend to average three operated and one non-operated drilling rigs during 2013, anticipating we will drill 39 wells. At Atchafalaya Bay, we anticipate our drilling activity will increase gross production from the field to 155 million cubic feet of gas per day from 140. Phase II of this facility expansion from the Atchafalaya Bay Field to [Belvieu] will be completed during the first quarter and startup of Phase III will commence, which should be completed late in the second quarter, bringing the capacity of the Atchafalaya Bay system to 220 million cubic feet of gas per day from 155. In the Gulf of Mexico shale, we plan to drill over 30 wells as we exploit low-risk liquids-rich prospects. We will also work to expand our inventory at permanent drill prospects and acquire additional wide-azimuth 3D seismic as we apply deepwater technology to the shale to enhance subsalt imaging and identify previously overlooked prospects. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we have drilled our position to 166 blocks and approximately 900,000 acres and have identified dozens of prospects to sustain an active exploration program for many years. In 2013, we plan to drill three operated exploration wells and four non-op development wells. We have two rigs under contract under drill prospects San Marcos and Mississippi Canyon 983, Starlight, Green Canyon 230, 274 and Guadeloupe in Mississippi Canyon 554, 555. We are moving forward with the partner-operated projects, Lucius and Heidelberg and expect to invest $200 million of our share of four wells in these two developments during 2013. In Canada, our 2013 program includes over 150 wells with a focus of oil and liquids-rich gas opportunities and horizontal exploitation of Sparky, Bluesky, Beaverhill Lake, Dunvegan and Viking oil plays. We also intend to test the Montney and Duvernay within our substantial acreage positions in these plays. Our 2013 plan in Australia totals nearly $1.9 billion, includes drilling 16 wells, six of which are for exploration. Mid-year the partner-operated Macedon gas project will be complete, and will add approximately 35 million cubic feet of gas per day of net production. But the real focus in Australia continues to be the long-term growth, we will realize from the pipeline of development projects we have lined up over the next several years. This includes the Julimar-Wheatstone LNG development project, the Coniston and Balnaves oil projects, the Moondyne and Upper Pyrenees projects and the Varanus Gas Compression project. Total capital allocated to these projects in 2013 exceeds $1.5 billion. With respect to the Coniston oil development, in order to repair the Ningaloo Vision FPSO for its increased throughput capacity, Apache has reviewed all requirements for planned maintenance and as scheduled, the vessel to go offline to the shipyard in the first quarter of 2014. This time we will take advantage of the 2014 cyclone season window should we normally see some weather-related downtime, thus optimizing production for 2013. Turn to Egypt, our operations continue uninterrupted. This asset remains a highly profitable piece of Apache portfolio and as such we plan to make a similar investment in 2013 as we did in 2012. This will allow us to drill over 270 wells including over 60 exploration wells. Our drilling program will focus on Bahariya, Abu Roash, Jurassic and AEB targets. So we are also looking to further test these horizontals in the region. These with our level of investment combined with the Heathrow field now online, we expect the gross production in Egypt to be slightly higher in 2014. In the North Sea, we plan to drill 27 wells of which 24 will be operated including 11 new wells at Forties and at least six at Beryl. We also plan to drill a third well at Bacchus field during the first quarter. In 2013, we will install a commission with pass top side and commits drilling operations. Two wells will be drilled and test in 2013. Apache will acquire a 307 square kilometer of 4D seismic survey of Forties and Bacchus fields commencing in July and complete the acquisition of the Beryl 3D seismic survey which we gave in the summer of 2012. In Argentina, our investment level will be consistent with recent years as we aim to invest within the region's cash flow. We plan to drill additional 20 wells during the year, 16 of which will be Apache operated focusing on gas plus wells as well as continued Vaca Muerta exploration activities. Finally, with respect to our venture activates, we continue to evaluate the well data we have collected from our Bakken and Mississippian Lime exploration wells, and we'll provide further detail in the future with respect to our path forward in these areas in including any development plans. In Alaska, we are in the final stages of drilling our first onshore well and expect to complete it in the second quarter. In Suriname, we have signed a 3D seismic acquisition contract for 2,100 square kilometer survey over our Block 53 and expect to commence seismic operations in the second quarter. One last item of note, before I turn the call over to Tom Chambers, due to Cyclone Narelle in offshore Australia and other weather events in Australia, unplanned facility downtime in the Gulf thus far this year, we expect first quarter 2013 production to be down versus fourth quarter 2012. However, we have already incorporated this downtime into our 2013 production guidance. That concludes the operational highlights, and I'll turn it over to Tom Chambers.
Thomas P. Chambers: Thanks Rod, and good afternoon, everyone. While 2012 provided plenty of challenges, we finished the fourth quarter strong, averaging 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, boosting us to record production for the year and fueling record oil and gas revenues in our second best cash flow year ever. Production which averaged 779,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day was up 4% from the prior year and up almost 5.5% adjusted for dispositions as Steve indicated. More importantly, record oil production of 352,000 barrels per day combined with record oil price realizations drove cash from operations before working capital items to $10.2 billion for the year and a record $2.8 billion for the quarter. Oil and gas revenues of $16.9 billion were slightly higher than 2011 and we achieved a new record in spite of average North American natural gas prices falling over 30%. We continue to benefit from our portfolio with WTI crude prices currently over 28 times the price of North American gas. Having 72% of our oil production priced at Brent or Brent-comparable indexes, which continues to realize substantial premiums to WTI, also enhances our results. Our international natural gas portfolio continues to have a positive revenue impact by providing increasing volumes to markets with gas prices significantly higher than North America particularly Argentina, Australia and the UK grid. For the fourth consecutive quarter international gas price realizations outpaced those of North America. In 2012 international gas price realizations increased 13% compared to the prior year and at $4.15 they were 47% higher than those realized in North America excluding hedging. Turning to earnings for 2012, as you heard we reported earnings of $1.9 billion or $4.92 per share, despite the impact of several key non-recurring items. Our results include prior quarter non-cash property write-downs in Canada totaling $1.4 billion aftertax directly related to collapsing Canadian natural gas prices. We had a number of other charges that impacted our results for the year including $226 million of deferred tax charges, $118 million tax adjustment in the UK related to decommissioning discussed in the third quarter, $51 million charge for derivative mark-to-market, and $19 million merger and acquisition charges. When we remove these items for comparability purposes, we earned $3.8 billion or $9.48 per share down from 2011’s $4.7 billion and $11.83 a share. The detailed breakout of all of our financials including adjusted earnings and cash flow from operations can be found in the financial supplement located on our website. The bottom line though is margins. We’ve been able to sustain strong cash margins at $42.86 per barrel of oil equivalent down just 6% from 2011. Margins were impacted by a 3% reduction in commodity price realization and a rise in our lease operating expenses. Current year repairs, maintenance and plant turnarounds directly impacted our LOE by almost $0.40 per BOE, predominantly related to the Grand Isle 43 corrosion repair and Canadian plant turnarounds. In addition, we have continued growth in our onshore North American operations, our labor costs have increased as well. Our operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are also impacted by the location of our properties. Oil properties are inherently more expensive than natural gas properties to operate as our offshore properties. The 51% of our 2012 production oil and liquids and approximately one-third of our production located in offshore areas, our costs run higher than many of our competitors. Total cash costs during the year averaged $17.06 per barrel of oil equivalent, up $0.82 over last year. For 2013, cash costs absent price dependent production tax are projected in the $14 to $16 per barrel of oil equivalent range. We remain focused on cash margins and continue to monitor our cost trends in all areas, in addition to reviewing our capital spending to ensure we focus on the highest rate of return projects. Our ability to sustain margins allows us to generate a robust $10 billion of operating cash flow that’s funded our largest E&P capital budget ever. In addition to our organic cash flow generation, we were able to successfully issue $5 billion of new debt this year at all in cost of 3.6%. $3 billion in April of five, 10 and 30 year tranches used to fund the cash portion of the Cordillera purchase price and repay maturing debt and additional $2 billion in December of 10 and 31 year notes with record low coupons allowing us to take advantage of continuing low rates to term up floating rate debt and increase our overall liquidity. Our successful E&P capital program with its focus on U.S. drilling added 372 million barrels of oil equivalent to proved reserves during 2012, that’s over 130% of what we produced during the year at a finding cost of a little over $24 per barrel. At first blush, that might seem high, but I’d like to point out that our 2012 spending included over $500 million of facilities capital, plus nearly $1.5 billion for leasehold and seismic purchases that while in the cost side, do not immediately result in reserve additions. Excluding this spending, finding cost would have been very competitive. While the seismic and leasehold purchases were very large last year, we do not see that trend continuing in 2013. However, these expenditures while seemingly a drag on finding cost now will provide a large benefit in the future setting the foundation for future growth. Reserve ads through acquisition totaled 73 million barrels of oil equivalent, bringing total ads to 156% of 2012 production. Unfortunately, low North American gas prices were primarily responsible for negative price revisions totaling 299 million barrels of oil equivalent, a majority in Canada. I would point out that with gas prices rebounding somewhat in the second half of the year, the negative revisions were halted after the third quarter and virtually, all of those reserves remain in the ground available to be produced if and when prices and economic conditions warrant. Turning to income taxes for a moment; the adjusting items mentioned earlier also impacted our 2012 effective tax rate, moving it up to 59%. If you adjust for these one-time charges, our tax rate would have been a more typical 44%. As mentioned earlier, 2013 will be another active drilling year and balancing our capital allocation and ensuring capital availability are key, because our cash flows are heavily influenced by oil realizations, we have recently entered into financial derivative contracts on 125,000 barrels a day of oil for calendar year 2013, using a combination of WTI and Brent swaps, representing about one-third of our worldwide oil production based on our fourth quarter of 2012 volumes. Our average combined hedge price is approximately 98,000 per barrel. We’ve not entered into any new gas hedges and our international gas portfolio exposure helps mitigate our North American price risk. In closing, we had a solid year of production revenues, cash flows resulting from our active drilling program. We have built a very strong foundation for cash flow generation and support both for our ongoing drilling program and our inventory of longer-term development projects as we head into 2013. And with that, I’d like to turn the call back over to Brady.
F. Brady Parish: Thank you, Tom. Allie, we are now ready to open the line for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Arun Jayaram from Credit Suisse.
Arun Jayaram – Credit Suisse Securities LLC: Can you hear me?
G. Steven Farris: Fairly.
Arun Jayaram – Credit Suisse Securities LLC: Fairly, okay.
G. Steven Farris: That’s fair.
Arun Jayaram – Credit Suisse Securities LLC: Steve, I wanted to talk to you a little bit about the overall production. I mean in October, you guys updated the market, and you’re about 800,000 barrels a day in overall production. So there, next quarter despite some pretty strong gains in the U.S. onshore and you’re guiding down now for Q1. So, the sense is you're losing a little bit of operating momentum outside of the U.S. So I was wondering if you could just comment on that and just the overall shift to a little bit of a lower growth rate in 2013, notwithstanding the changes in capital allocation.
G. Steven Farris: To be real frank, holding 800,000 barrels a day for quarter, we were very proud of that frankly, because we’ve never hit that from where we were. In terms of going into 2013, the first quarter, we’re affected by Hurricane; I mean a cyclone in Australia. I will tell you though we put that downtime in our 3% to 5% growth projection. There is no doubt that we have some properties that are declining, but we’re going to more than make up for it in the Permian and the Anadarko Basin this year. And we’re pretty confident about the long-term value of our Canadian assets also.
Arun Jayaram – Credit Suisse Securities LLC: Okay. And just I was wondering if you could comment. Has there been any change in the way you’re thinking about? I know guidance is relatively new to Apache thinking about the long-term. Are you all changing your approach, you may be trying to guide to like P90 type of case versus maybe P50 differently. So just trying to see if there has been any change in the way you’re thinking about guidance I guess?
G. Steven Farris: We are new to this. I have to be real honest with you. One thing that we don’t want to do is, miss our guidance. We’re going to spend quite a bit of money intentionally in a few, remember what Rod said, $1.5 billion of that $2.2 billion is going to Australia. The biggest chunk of that is Julimar, Brunello and the Wheatstone LNG facility, which is now over 80% contracted. And those are tied to oil linked prices, so when that comes on, we’re going to see about over 25,000 barrels a day for the next 25 years.
Operator: Your next question comes from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Co.
Pearce W. Hammond – Simmons & Co. International: Good afternoon.
G. Steven Farris: Good afternoon.
Pearce W. Hammond – Simmons & Co. International: Steve, I just wanted to get a little color. You mentioned about the possibility of maybe divesting around $2 billion worth of assets for that 3% to 5% production growth guidance for 2013. Is that guidance already includes the potential sale of those assets, if there’s production or would the guidance potentially need to be adjusted after the sale?
G. Steven Farris: The guidance would be adjusted after the sale.
Pearce W. Hammond – Simmons & Co. International: Thank you. And my follow-up would be on service costs, specifically in the Permian and then in your Central region. Just curious as you look at 2013 and compare it to 2012, how do you see service costs trending? Do you think that prices are bottoming and are there any areas of services right now whether they’re a little bit tightening in one of those regions?
G. Steven Farris: Rod you…
Rodney J. Eichler: The service costs in both areas are flat and declining and we see that, specifically, we see that in the Permian, they have been very large increases in the frac stimulation companies. as a result, that’s provided simply downward pressure on the pricing of that. We’ve seen a 30% drop in frac spread costs compared to 2012 as well as we might expect to see even more decline in our side from using more self-sourcing of same in chemicals in 2013, which will allow us to further reduce those stimulation costs. Same thing on rig rates. Spud rates are much more favorable than they were. We’ve seen about a 5% to 7% decline in rig rates. For the mechanical rigs, 2,000 horsepower rigs we used to build the vertical wells at Deadwood, that’s an example and we expect to see continued downward pressure on those as well.
Roger B. Plank: Pearce, it’s Roger. Just one a little bit of comment on the sales. We’re going to identify exactly what it is, we’re going to sell, but not everything necessarily would have current production for example, the assets that we sold to Chevron, I guess last week, we collected $400 million and there is no production associated with that.
Pearce W. Hammond – Simmons & Co. International: Great, thank you for the color, Roger.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Herrlin with Société Générale.
John P. Herrlin – Société Générale Americas Securities, LLC: Regarding the Permian, you said in your ops report that you spud 22 horizontal wells with 463 frac stages. Are you going to be increasing the frac densities at all because it averages about 20 wells. I was just curious.
Rodney J. Eichler: It depends a lot on what's lower or unconventional target that we are after in terms of the optimal frac concentration and we have a lot of efforts underway right now. They are various areas specific to try to optimize the amount of frac stages. And large numbers, not necessarily the optimal number and we're trying to find out the certain areas. So we expect to see overall improvements in both the cost and efficiency of our frac treatment programs in both the Permian and Central as we go forward in 2013 based on a lot of the benchmarking we are doing to become a best-in-class operator in these areas, we're drilling horizontal completions.
John P. Herrlin – Société Générale Americas Securities, LLC: Okay, thanks Rod. Next one from me is on the Central; are those lateral lengths listed really the lateral length of the horizontals or is that kind of a type of?
Rodney J. Eichler: My guess is that we'll have that.
G. Steven Farris: I will go with the numbers, John.
John P. Herrlin – Société Générale Americas Securities, LLC: Or you're going from 12,000 to 16,000 feet, 18,000 feet, Steve. Is that lateral?
Rodney J. Eichler: That's the full measured dip.
G. Steven Farris: That's the vertical and horizontal.
John P. Herrlin – Société Générale Americas Securities, LLC: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.
David R. Tameron – Wells Fargo Advisors LLC: Good afternoon everybody. A couple of things, the PSC contracts, you said you just – and then you said, I guess bid round, you got a lease and you're going to have a revised PSC contract. Can you talk about that and should we read into that is that's where the government is headed going forward?
Rodney J. Eichler: Could you repeat that question? It was very broken up.
David R. Tameron – Wells Fargo Advisors LLC: This now better.
Rodney J. Eichler: Little bit.
David R. Tameron – Wells Fargo Advisors LLC: Okay, sorry I’ve trouble here with the phone. But In Egypt, if you talk about winning in the recent round of bidding, you won a couple of leases and there's going to be a new PSC contract. So I'm just wondering if we should read anything into that. Is that the direction that we should expect the contracts to go in Egypt?
G. Steven Farris: Well, the one thing I would say is they have continual posting of leases in Egypt, concessions in Egypt that people bid on. The most significant thing about the latest bid round were they were very similar to all of the other concessions that we've got in the Western Desert. So, there weren't any term changes in terms of what they had asked for in the latest bid round.
David R. Tameron – Wells Fargo Advisors LLC: Okay, so your expectation for this contract is that they're going to look just like the last year?
G. Steven Farris: There's always a – the cost recovery goes from 35% to 40%, but in terms of directionally, it's pretty much the same as all our concessions across the Western Desert.
David R. Tameron – Wells Fargo Advisors LLC: Okay. New Zealand, can you talk a little bit about what's happened there?
G. Steven Farris: Did you say New Zealand?
David R. Tameron – Wells Fargo Advisors LLC: New Zealand, yeah.
G. Steven Farris: Well, I think what we – in terms of the long-term potential, there is definitely a tremendous amount of hydrocarbon service. Being able to do that and the magnitude that it takes over the timeframe that it takes, we've decided that that wasn't in our best interest, and you're going to see that when we talk about our asset sales. We now have some long-term projects that have some significant durability and significant potential and so we're going to have to balance off our long-term and our short-term in terms of being able to grow both long-term – but also be able to grow short-term.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bob Brackett with Sanford Bernstein.
Bob A. Brackett – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, good afternoon, I had a question. What do you expect to do with the proceeds from the divestments of $2 billion?
G. Steven Farris: Well, originally we're going to pay down debt, but when we get there we'll have to make a decision as to what we do with the proceeds but the first call on it is going to be pay down debt.
Bob A. Brackett – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And then a question, I thought I heard you say you're going to start water flooding in the Granite Wash. What's the concept there? Is it true the horizontals that have been fraced?
Rodney J. Eichler: No, the reference to the water flooding was to the Canyon Wash which is in our Bivins Ranch field which is a vertical convention development (inaudible).
Bob A. Brackett – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks.
Rodney J. Eichler: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Magner with Macquarie.
Joe Magner – Macquarie Research: Good afternoon. Just a few questions, on the divestitures, while some will not be productive anywhere to ballpark how much is associated, how much I guess current production is associated what is the?
G. Steven Farris: I think when we get there we will announce what – we've got a number of different banks that we're looking at.
Joe Magner – Macquarie Research: Okay. Then one of the comments you mentioned that 72% I believe of your oil is linked to Brent or Brent equivalents. Can you provide any perspective on how you see price differences playing out between Brent and WTI, Brent and LLS and then also Midland Cushing going forward?
G. Steven Farris: Well, I think Brent if the world price. And when you look at 5% of the well is traded at WTI prices and so what you have is, that you have a bottleneck in certain areas, certainly West Texas is one of them, there is an awful lot of people trying to solve that problem. I think Tom or Rod pointed out that we have an equity interest or a throughput interest in the pipeline that we're going to start, and there are going to be more and more of those. My personal opinion is that I think those numbers will come and it's not going to be in the next 18 months but over time they're going to – that spread is going to shallow. I mean I just think that's not attainable forever.
Joe Magner – Macquarie Research: By spread you mean Brent TI spread or…?
G. Steven Farris: Yes.
Joe Magner – Macquarie Research: Okay. Are there any, other than pipelines in the Permian, I guess as you think about just routing crude from and where you're producing onshore to where it needs to be. Any other significant plans or infrastructure projects that could create bottlenecks or constraints on being able to achieve your plan for this year?
G. Steven Farris: Not really, not to achieve that plan. We certainly and the Permian basin as you know, and I'm sure you know that there is a number of areas that are getting built or projected to be built but it's not going to affect our 2013 plan.
Operator: Your next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Doug Leggate – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Good afternoon everybody. I hope you can hear me okay. I've got a couple of questions if I may. Steve, clearly, this is a bit of a change from what you told us at the Analyst Day last year. Can you help us understand is this move away from the growth target in 2013, a move away from the long-term growth target as well. In other words, are you abandoning now the 6% to 12% target you laid out and just, so if you could help us understand what's changed?
G. Steven Farris: No, in fact, it's not. If you look at our asset base, it really is based on what our capital allocation is this year. If you look at the – if the amount of production that we are developing, it should help us in terms of obtaining that – actually we are at 6% to 9% if you don't include gas. We see gas go up, we can drill more gas wells, but right now 6% to 9%, we are still looking at that from a long-term basis.
Doug Leggate – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I think you had kind of signaled that you tempered gas, so that would be the number, so I appreciate that. My follow-up is really on the asset sales. Forgive me if I'm wrong here, but it sounds like you haven't quite identified what the assets are, or have you? Is it a bottom-up process, or are you seeing $2 billion as a number and then trying to make that fit? In my [meeting] going to this is, how big ultimately does that disposal process get as clearly they're extremely asset-rich and you're obviously not getting a lot of credit on the share price, and I'll leave it at that? Thanks.
G. Steven Farris: Doug, I didn't. Well, in terms of – certainly we have considered assets that we may sell. In terms of specifics and our pricing, I mean we've also scoped the order of magnitude of the pricing. But we're really not in a position at the present time to talk about which one of those asset bases that be. All of them will not include current production.
Thomas P. Chambers: I'd like to go back to your question about, are we abandoning in the long-term. Really, just think about what Rod said in these long-term projects we're spending over $2 billion on this year. They're going to add 150,000 barrels a day, and then later 200,000 barrels a day. So, those are big needle moving projects where we've got to put capital over a number of years. We don't get near-term production growth, but when they come on, you see a real stair step in our growth. And so, when Steve was talking about LNG projects, for example, those are very big stair steps that will bring our average rate over the long-term back to the kind of range that we were talking about earlier. But in the short-term, those are dollars that aren't adding production in 2013. The rate of return is great, but when you bring them online especially those LNG projects they don't deplete. So they are very enticing.
Operator: Your next question comes from Matthew Portillo with Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.
Matthew Portillo – Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.: Good afternoon.
Thomas P. Chambers: Good afternoon.
Matthew Portillo – Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.: Just two quick questions for me, with limited capital investments in Canada around your gas assets, could you give us a little bit of color on how we should think about volume decline, and then a similar question for the U.S.?
G. Steven Farris: Yeah, the capital allocation I think represents $600 million in Canada, which will be directed. Now what we have done just for information, we now have a Kitimat upstream business and we have our base Canadian operations business and we have two different organizations just recently set up; one to do nothing, but the Horn River and Liard. In terms of the base business in terms of our – we are really directing that more towards liquids-rich and in terms of what’s the decline curve is I don’t know. I don’t have it. We should see a slight decline, but it’s not real significant.
Matt Portillo – Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.: Okay, great. And then just a second question for me. In terms of the Permian and the Midland Basin, could you provide a little color on how your Cline results have performed to-date? How those look against your type curves, and then how we should think about current well costs? Thank you.
G. Steven Farris: Rod, you might.
Rodney J. Eichler: Yeah. In the Cline, we’ve really had some good progress on the Cline and we’ve managed to cut six days of the amount of time, it takes to do a Cline horizontal from the Deadwood area. When that translates to an average split rate is about $60,000 a day savings, which translates into about $360,000 wells, that’s very significant. And then generally speaking, we gave you some information at the Analyst Day last June that it cost us about $7.6 million and as a result of some of these efficiency improvements and overall cost reductions that I mentioned that we should be under $7 million in total well cost in that particular formation, and I think the Cline, the well results have been posted in the supplement.
Matt Portillo – Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice and Company LLC.
Charles A. Meade – Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Hello, everyone. If you don't mind, too much, I'm going to take one more step at the guidance question, because I think the other question maybe got us a little bit, we have a – you've laid out the 3% to 5% overall BOE guidance, but it's maybe not that – it's not meaningful. It's not apples-to-apples to replace – when you're replacing oil volumes with gas volumes or vice versa as you guys are. So, if you have it in your mind and can share it, do you have an idea of the four pieces of your product mix that North American liquids, North American gas, international liquids, international gas, what the individual growth rates on those four would be? Or maybe you might not have it, but I just thought it.
G. Steven Farris: Everybody is scrambling for information here, give us a second.
Charles A. Meade – Johnson Rice & Co. LLC: Well, you can come back to that and another thing, I greatly appreciate all the data in the operations supplement you have. Just two of those – just two things on that if I could ask; one, I saw you guys drilled another really good horizontal on the Central Basin platform in the Permian, and I think you're really the only operator who's been doing that. So, I'm curious if you're planning on doing a lot of much more event and then, the last kind of obscure question that comes from the operations release is, I noticed in the Gulf Coast region, you said you're drilling in Lamar County, Mississippi, and I'm wondering if that's the smack-over target or if you're ready to talk about that?
G. Steven Farris: Rod?
Rodney J. Eichler: Well, the answer to your first question, I believe you might be referring to our drilling program in our Three Bar Shallow Unit, which is the Wichita Albany play. I think we mentioned that at our last quarter's call. We've continued to drill. We have five wells drilled and producing there. It’s one of our best plays and take in terms of the estimated ultimate recovery for horizontal wells and we have about a couple of wells that are waiting on completion and we have additional 12 wells yet to drill in that program, a lot of which would be drilled in 2013. Your second question dealt with what are we doing in Lamar County, Mississippi?
Charles Meade – Johnson Rice: That’s right.
Rodney J. Eichler: Well, we’re drilling an exploration test and that’s in progress. That’s all we want to say about it right now.
Charles Meade – Johnson Rice: Got it, okay. Thank you very much, and if you have those other growth rates, I’m going to stay on the call and queue up whenever you guys are ready.
G. Steven Farris: North American Oil is supposed to grow at 14% for 2013. That’s what we’re projecting.
Operator: Your next question comes from Leo Mariani with RBC Capital.
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: Hi, guys. You talked about some exploration plans in 2013. I think you guys said three deepwater Gulf wells and then six wells in Australia. Could you give us some more information about what type of targets those are and what some of the associated growth potential maybe on some of those?
Rodney J. Eichler: In Australia, the wells are mostly in the Olympus-Bianchi, the general quadrant going south, just north of Exmouth Basin area. They’re targeting the typical Mungaroo Triassic reservoir objectives, which we have in other producing areas out there. We have successful exploration tests at Zola back two years ago and we’re following up on that. In the Gulf of Mexico deepwater, as I recall that those specific targets or those prospects I mentioned will probably be [Midland Basin].
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thanks. And I guess, additionally another question on the asset sales. Traditionally Apache has been obviously an acquirer of a lot of assets over the years. Is there any sort of shift in philosophy that you guys are seeing here, now that you have announced these asset sales, somewhat I guess prior to specifically identifying it. I mean, you guys trying to maybe strengthen the balance sheet in response to maybe some capital expenditures coming up on the LNG side in the next couple of years? How are you guys kind of thinking about it, if there is any just philosophical change, just curious on that?
G. Steven Farris: Well, from a philosophical standpoint if you look at where we have come from over the last three years, and if you look at the assets that we’ve acquired, and it's not just here in the last week but over the last month or two, we’ve been looking at our asset base and saying, okay, now which one of these asset bases do we want to take forward into the future. And we have to make some tough choices – we can't be all things to all people. So we go to make some choices as to which one of these that we can actually exploit or could somebody else exploit them better. So we're still going to be a net buyer. If you think about $16 billion and $2 billion, but in terms of just transitioning our asset base that's what the effort's about.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian A. Singer – Goldman Sachs: Thanks, good afternoon. Just picking up on the growth in the asset sales and the acquisitions together. It's interesting to know that the areas that you have that are growing rapidly, the Permian and the Midcontinent are where you have focused your acquisitions over the last couple of years. And then, so I guess in your interest in achieving your 6% to 9% guidance longer-term, there are various ways you could do, you could acquire more assets in growth areas, you could sell assets and producing areas that have little growth, or you could just wait it out as kind of Roger described, and wait till some of these long lead time projects come online. Is it fair to say, that it's more of the latter strategy there just kind of wait things out until the long lead projects come online that you've kind of decided on. And then, in that case, should 2014 be another year of relatively low growth?
G. Steven Farris: Yeah. We haven't reported our 2014 plan. It really depends on how we allocate that capital, Brian, and also what our asset base looks like. We certainly want to further those long-term projects, but we also have to balance this. What I was suggesting is, we have to balance short-term growth with long-term growth.
Brian A. Singer – Goldman Sachs: So I guess, would you consider acquiring any areas that have become more core to you or as for the rest, or are kind of acquisitions completely off the table here?
G. Steven Farris: Well for the present time, we are going to drill wells. So that doesn't mean we won't pick up an acre or two around some place, but in terms of making major acquisitions in our existing core areas or new core areas, that's not something that's part of our strategy right now.
Rodney J. Eichler: On a project side, we do have three or four projects, which will mature to first production in 2014. These are in Egypt and in Australia and that could add, approximately in the range of 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Brian A. Singer – Goldman Sachs: Great thanks. And then just to clarify on the asset sale decision, have you definitive call that you're going to sell the $2 billion of assets or are you considering asset sales up to $2 billion?
G. Steven Farris: Obviously price has something to do with it, but we certainly are dedicated to selling $2 billion worth of assets.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin Cashman with Assurant.
Kevin Cashman – Assurant: Hi, and thanks for taking the question. Just kind of following up on the asset sales in the – you mentioned some of your refinancing last year with the two 2013 maturities coming up. I'm just wondering, you mentioned debt reduction would that be a plan to reduce those ultimately with the debt proceeds or payment?
Thomas P. Chambers: Yes, I mean that's a consideration. Once we get, depending on the timing of when we get these assets sold and what else is on our plate, that is definitely a consideration to pay down that debt.
Kevin Cashman – Assurant: Have you guys had your annual meeting with the rating agencies for this point already?
Thomas P. Chambers: No.
Kevin Cashman – Assurant: When is that coming up?
Thomas P. Chambers: Shortly.
Kevin Cashman – Assurant: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Howe with Robert W. Baird.
Michael Howe – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I guess, my point has been addressed but I'll jump back on the production outlook topic, commented through the question in another way. As you look at just your mix of natural gas oil liquids, do you see that shifting materially as we make our way through 2013, you've seen a nice...
G. Steven Farris: You're going to see our oil production as a percentage continue to grow up.
Michael Howe – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: All right.
G. Steven Farris: Because we are predominantly drilling oil wells or liquid rich gas wells.
Michael Howe – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Can you quantify any of the changes, directionally?
G. Steven Farris: What we have said and I don't have the numbers in front of me, Brady is looking at them. What we say is we're going to grow our North American oil by 14%, so.
Operator: And your final question comes from Joe Magner with Macquarie.
Joseph Magner – Macquarie Capital: Yeah, just one quick follow-up, I wondered if you had any update on some of the new exploration ventures that were detailed fall of last year in the Cook Inlet, Montana, Mississippi in particular.
G. Steven Farris: We are almost down on our Alaska well. We were 11,400 feet; we're going to 11,800 feet. Then obviously we'll have to test it and run pipe and all that stuff. And in the Bakken, in Montana, and in the Mississippi Lime, we've drilled few wells bulk of those we're really concentrating our efforts right now on the United States, on the Permian and the Anadarko Basin. And then we just picked up a block as Rod pointed out, we picked up a block in Suriname which is a very good block and we're getting ready to shoot 3D seismic on it.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to the hosts for any closing remarks.
F. Brady Parish: Thank you very much for attending our conference today. We appreciate it, and if you have any additional questions, obviously, reach out to the IR team and we will get back to you as soon as we can. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brady Parish, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Brady Parish: Thank you, Regina. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. For all of you who have been impacted by Hurricane Sandy, we wanted to let you know that our thoughts are with you and your loved ones. This morning, we reported earnings of $161 million or $0.41 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $861 million or $2.16 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations totaled $2.4 billion for the quarter. On today's call, we will have 3 speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. First, we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer; and finally, Tom Chambers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We prepared our quarterly supplemental data package for your use, which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or pretax margins. This data package can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financialdata. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
G. Steven Farris: Thank you, Brady. And good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As I'm sure you've all read in our release this morning, during the third quarter, we accelerated our drilling momentum. Across our portfolio, we've got excellent results. In the U.S., we continued to step up our play activity and now run 63 rigs, 50% more than we did at the beginning -- had at the beginning of the year. And Rod is going to go on a lot more detail, but we've got outstanding well results in a number of plays, including the Cline, Wolfcamp and Wichita Albany and the Canyon Wash and the Permian Basin and also the Granite Wash and the Anadarko Basin. During the quarter, our growing drillbit momentum was also notable on the international front. In the North Sea, after consolidating our expanded portfolio early in the year, we're having very good drilling results with excellent flow rates from all discoveries across our fields. And the value of Apache as operator, I think, has just been endorsed by a major, with Shell last week announcing their purchase of half this [ph] position and many of the Apache-operated fields in the region. In Argentina, we completed our first Vaca Muerta horizontal well, which was a relatively short lateral. It was about 1,900 feet with only 7 fracs. It's early days, but the well results have been very encouraging. We continue to set the economics of the play. We have 4 additional horizontal tests that's planned over the next few months. We have 450,000 net acres in this play, and it has enormous resource potential. After a very successful portfolio expansion phase over the last 2.5 years, we really focused -- refocused back to the drillbit. We hold a leading position in some of the most attractive basins and plays around the world, and we intend to actively exploit this resource potential for the benefit of our shareholders. As we disclosed by our press release last month, our third quarter reported production reflects approximately 25,000 barrels of oil a day of production downtime, which were due primarily to hurricane disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico and the scheduled North Sea platform turnarounds. Our third quarter production averaged about 771,000 barrels a day. And if you put 25,000 barrels on top of that, which is all back on right now, we're -- we've -- we're producing today approximately 800,000 barrels a day. The important thing is we remain on track to deliver our production growth guidance for the year and we're going to stay within our $10 billion exploration and development budget. One final note. And as we continue to build and execute our global pipeline of exploration activity, we're testing 2 wells, 1 in the Williston Basin -- both which we have large acreage positions; and the Mississippian Lime. The good news is we've had good oil shows from the logs and the formations that we were targeting. We're currently completion -- in the completion phase of our initial wells in each of these plays, and we'll be experimenting with our frac designs to give us optimal results. We secured a number of blocks in the recent Gulf of Mexico lease sale. We have captured a highly sought-after deepwater block in Suriname, which is on trend with recent play opening and discoveries. You should expect our drillbit momentum to continue. We have built the foundation of this portfolio over the several years, and this is personally the most exciting time for me over the last 25 years. We have the asset depth, financial strength and delivery expertise to stand out in this sector, and that's exactly what we intend to do. Now I'll turn it over to Rodney.
Rodney J. Eichler: Thank you, Steve. Our total reported net production for the third quarter was approximately 771,000 boe per day. Hurricane Isaac in the Gulf of Mexico and outages in the North Sea due to scheduled maintenance activities reduced production by 13,000 boe per day and 12,000 boe per day, respectively. Currently, all of this production is back online and we have entered the fourth quarter with record worldwide net production. During the third quarter, we continued the conversion of our extensive onshore oil and hydrocarbon liquids-rich inventory into production and cash flow. We rank among the most active drillers in North America, having operated an average of 66 drilling rigs in our U.S. regions during the quarter, including 35 in our Permian region and 24 in our Central region, with outstanding results. Our Permian and Central region averaged combined net production of approximately 184,000 boe per day during the third quarter, nearly 1/4 of our total worldwide net production. Moreover, this represents an increase of 15% over the second quarter averaged net production of 160,000 boe per day and an increase of 30% over third quarter 2011 net boe production of 141,000 boe per day. With the inventory of over 67,000 locations in these 2 regions alone, we remain on track to deliver double-digit growth in the oil and liquids-rich Permian and Central regions for years to come. In addition, we are continuing our very active new venture exploration program. Steve already elaborated on our encouraging results in the Mississippi Lime and Williston Basin and Vaca Muerta shale, so I'll not address these plays here. In Alaska, we are on track to spud our first well in the Cook Inlet during the fourth quarter. Finally, in October we signed a new production shoring agreement to explore a high-potential area in Block 53 offshore Suriname in the equatorial margin fairway. We were awarded 100% interest in this block and expect to commence a 3D seismic program during 2013. Now turning to more detail in our regions. The Permian had another outstanding quarter as we continue to grow through drillbit. Third quarter production averaged nearly 112,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 7% increase over the second quarter, with part of the increase resulting from additional NGL processing at the Deadwood plant as it became fully operational. Our substantial acreage position continues to provide Apache the flexibility and optionality to test new plays and concepts. During the quarter, we added 230,000 gross acreage to our overall acreage position, the majority of which was in the Midland Basin and the Wolfcamp play. We now hold over 3.7 million gross acres across the hydrocarbon-rich Permian Basin. We are now the most active driller in the basin and, during the quarter, averaged 35 rigs, drilling 201 wells of which 26 were horizontal. We expect to continue our shift to more horizontal drilling in the fourth quarter and into 2013 when we anticipate nearly half of our drilling rigs will be horizontal. Drilling at Deadwood and Yeso continue to be a large contributor to growth, while Irion County Wolfcamp horizontal activity and potential continues to expand. At Deadwood where we are targeting the Wolfwood and Fusselman with vertical wells, we averaged a 15-rig program for the quarter. Earlier in the year, we acquired additional 3D seismic data, with the first migrated data arriving earlier in third quarter. This new seismic information greatly enhanced our ability to target the prolific Fusselman accumulations, and new locations are continuing to be identified. A couple of our most recent Fusselman successes are the Squire 9 #5 well, which flowed at 339 barrels of oil per day and 677 Mcf per day; and the Reilly [ph] 37 #8, which produced at a rate of 166 barrels of oil per day and 256 Mcf per day. Drilling in the Deadwood area will complete the main active throughout 2012 and into 2013. We operate 2 horizontal rigs in the Deadwood area, targeting the shale of the Wolfcamp, Atoka/Barnett and the Lower Cline formations. The latest Cline well in Deadwood is Apache's best well to date. The [indiscernible] 45-2H was drilled on the Southeast edge of our Deadwood acreage. The well was drilled to a TD of 13,350 feet measured depth with a 1,300-foot lateral, and after an 11-stage frac, the well obtained a peak rate of 810 boe per day. The well has averaged 623 boe per day in its initial 30 days production and has produced nearly 26,000 barrels of oil equivalent to date, with a preliminary EUR of about 600,000 barrels. The average EUR of the last 5 Cline wells is now 452,000 [ph] barrels. Also in Deadwood, a lower Wolfcamp Deadwood shale lateral was drilled 1,300 feet to a TD of 12,900 feet measured depth and tested at peak rate of over 200 barrels of oil per day and 200 Mcf per day. Additional appraisal wells are planned for the Wolfcamp and Cline shale plays in 2013, and commercialization of these shales could add hundreds of potential locations to the 560 locations already identified in the Cline shale. We have additional -- also drilled a horizontal well in the Barnett Shale. And after a 14-stage frac, the peak rate exceeded 380 barrels of oil per day and 613 Mcf per day. In the Barnhart Wolfcamp play, Apache has drilled 13 wells, 8 producing and the remainder either in drilling or frac-ing or flow-back stages. Since March 2012, these 8 wells have produced 234,000 barrels of oil and 509 million cubic feet of gas or 319,000 boe from the upper Wolfcamp Shales only. Current Wolfcamp production is 2,150 boe per day. Two middle camp -- two middle Wolfcamp wells are currently drilling, and a Cline horizontal well on Ketchum Mountain will spud soon. In the other Midland Basin and eastern shale properties, we have had some notable results in the Wilshire area such as the well at McElroy Ranch that tested as high as 289 barrels of oil per day and 735 mcf a day from the Spraberry through 10 [ph] intervals on a submersible pump. In the Yeso area of New Mexico, we ended the quarter running 4 vertical rigs. 27 vertical wells were spud during the third quarter and 22 wells are completed and producing. Notable wells from the quarter include the Lee Federal #59, which averaged 168 barrels of oil per day and 403 Mcf per day during September; and the Tony Federal #39 whose 30-day well test averaged 119 barrels of oil per day and 287 Mcf per day. Our fourth rig, recently transitioned from drilling vertical wells to commencing our multiyear Shear [ph] Lake horizontal drilling program. We continue to have good results from the Central Basin Platform where we are applying horizontal drilling to historically conventional fields and reservoirs with outstanding results. In the Three Bar shallow unit, we have tested the Wichita Albany, an interval characterized by air bed [ph] limestones and dolomite frosty zones at measured depths of 7,000 feet. Results from the first 2 wells include the 10-1H, with a 30-day average production of 848 barrels of oil per day and 465 Mcf per day, and the 105-H, with an 18-day average production of 620 barrels of oil per day and 754 Mcf per day. We plan to run one rig in the unit during the fourth quarter. As we drill more, we learn more, and we are able to improve the efficiency of our exploration and operations activities, as evidenced by these widespread encouraging results. We continue to be excited about the abundant opportunities and growth prospects of our Permian Basin position. In our Central region, we are also seeing excellent results in new ramp up activity across our nearly 2 million gross acres. Production was 72,300 boe per day, up 31% from the second quarter. Adjusting for acquired Cordillera production, growth was 24% quarter-over-quarter as we realized the benefits of our active oil and liquids-rich drilling program. The growth was driven by a 42% increase in oil production and a 20% increase in gas production. Our opportunities in the region continue to expand, following our May acquisition of over 312,000 net acres and subsequent 18,000 additional acres in the heart of the Anadarko Basin. During the third quarter, this region operated an average of 24 drilling rigs, 23 of which were horizontal and drilled 40 wells with 100% success. During the same period, we completed 26 new wells, for an average daily rate of 485 barrels of oil per day and 2,700 Mcf of gas per day. We continue to work numerous plays across our acreage position. Notable highlights in the quarter include strong results in the oily Tonkawa, Marmaton and Cottage Grove, a new horizontal play we're testing on our Stiles Ranch, and other properties. In the Tonkawa, for example, our Karen 1-25H averaged 525 barrels of oil per day at 1.8 million cubic feet gas per day for the first 30 days of production, and the Steward 1-20H averaged 654 barrels of oil per day and 758 Mcf per day. In the Marmaton, we also had positive results, including the Standing [ph] Eagle 1-16H, which averaged 514 barrels of oil per day and 5.8 million cubic feet of gas per day and the Maddole [ph] 1-18H, which averaged 1,116 barrels of oil per day at 8.9 million cubic feet of gas per day. The Cottage Grove also provide strong results, with the Stiles 24 68H averaging 893 barrels of oil per day and 1.2 million cubic feet of gas and the Stiles 12-1H averaging 1,652 barrels of oil per day at 1.6 million cubic feet of gas per day. The Granite Wash continues to be a significant focus of our drilling program, and during the quarter, we tested the Weatherlee [ph] 6-1H, which averaged 672 barrels of oil per day and 5.7 million cubic feet of gas per day. In general, we were finding enough oil in the Granite Wash that remains economic despite low NGL prices. In the Texas Panhandle, drilling success continues in the Canyon Wash on our 200 square-mile Bivins Ranch acreage. During the quarter, we completed our 9th and 10th successful wells, which tested 1,050 barrels of oil per day and 950 Mcf per day and 1,447 barrels of oil per day and 1,199 Mcf per day. This is an encouraging validation of Apache's play concept. Keep in mind, these 1,000-plus barrel a day wells are for vertical wells. To debottleneck our growing production, we completed a 9-mile pipeline in transport stranded natural gas during the quarter, thereby securing our takeaway from the area, which has grown from 0 to over 5,000 barrels of oil per day in 14 months. The line is currently selling 3.3 million cubic feet of gas per day of 1,450 BTU gas with NGL recoveries. Additionally, we added a second rig in the Bivins Ranch area. During the third quarter, low ethane prices at Conway resulted in ethane rejections for the region. The ethane rejection was limited to the month of July and August as ethane prices at Conway dropped to record lows in early July. At that time, Conway ethane was trading at approximately at 90% discount to Mont Belvieu. In the end of the third quarter, this discount was reduced to approximately 42% to Mont Belvieu. Currently, Conway ethane is discounted 44% to Mont Belvieu. Turning to the Gulf of Mexico Shelf. Quarterly production was down 8% to 90,000 boe per day as a result of approximately 10,000 boe per day of curtailments due to Hurricane Isaac. This was due primarily to the storm's impact on third-party facilities as Apache's infrastructure was relatively unharmed. With shut-ins behind us, we are currently running 8 rigs, 2 of which are focused on P&A work, year-to-date, we have TD-ed 21 operated wells, offsetting some of the downtime experience during the quarter with positive well results with our shelf drilling program. For example, the Main Pass 315 well came online at 634 barrels of oil per day and Eugene Island, the 118 B#1, sidetrack penetrated 45 feet of gas and a few [ph] sand. At Ship Shoal, the 126 B well came online at 522 barrels of oil per day and 3.8 million cubic feet of gas to date. And 2 new wells at Main Pass 308 came online for a combined rate of 1,555 barrels of oil per day. The total platform rate is currently 2,596 barrels of oil per day, but production is being curtailed due to facility restrictions. Modifications are currently being designed to remedy the situation. We've now been awarded 60 -- 61 blocks from the June 20 federal lease sale, adding to our inventory of opportunities in the Gulf. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we plan to increase our rig count by 1 when a rig finishes the 7-month shipyard project. By the end of the quarter, we plan to complete the Main Pass 308 drilling program. The last location is drilling and one recompletion is remaining. Our Eugene Island 330 drilling program will also continue through the end of 2012, with 2 additional locations to be drilled. In the deep Gulf, third quarter production was relatively flat as a full 3 months of production from our Wide Berth and Mandy fields was offset by Hurricane Isaac downtime. We anticipate bringing our Bushwood field near future as capacity is freed up from [indiscernible] depletion. This will add approximately 4,500 net boe per day to the region's production. During the second quarter, we announced our participation in the June 20 Central Gulf of Mexico lease sale. The awards have now been completed and we received 28 blocks. During 2013, we are taking delivery of 2 rigs to begin exploring these prospects. In our Gulf Coast Onshore region, average production was up 8% over the second quarter to 27,000 boe per day as additional takeaway capacity was installed at our Atchafalaya Bay field and production was reestablished in the Lake Paige Field. These additions, coupled with new production volumes and continued drilling success at our Chapman Ranch in South Texas and Golden Meadow Fields onshore Louisiana helped to offset production deferrals due to Hurricane Isaac. A notable highlight from this region was the Scottsdale [ph] #1 well in South Louisiana, which tested 20.2 million cubic feet of gas per day and 199 barrels of oil per day at 47-degree API gravity oil. We plan to complete the installation of a 4-mile, 8-inch flowline connecting the well to our Atchafalaya Bay production facility before year-end. Apache's Gulf Coast Onshore region initiated production this morning to a newly installed 12-inch pipeline connecting our Atchafalaya Bay production facility to TransCanada or ANR's 30-inch pipeline 5 miles away. We are currently ramping up production to 50 million cubic feet of gas gross per day, with plans to increase production to 75 million cubic feet of gas gross per day over the next few days. This marks the completion of Phase 1 of our Atchafalaya Bay infrastructure project. Phase 2 is anticipated to be complete during the second quarter of next year, which will bring gross production from our Atchafalaya Bay wells up to 220 million cubic feet of gas per day, an increase in current producing rates by an incremental 170 million cubic feet of gas per day. Apache has a working [ph] interest of approximately 48% to 50% in these wells. Looking ahead, we intend to have 6 operated rigs running during the fourth quarter as we focus our efforts on oil opportunities in Southeastern Texas, Southern Louisiana and Southern Mississippi. Heading north to Canada. Production in the third quarter was steady as the region continued to transition to more oil and liquids-rich production. Drilling has focused on several plays across our extensive acreage position such as Dunvegan, Bluesky and Sparky. Well highlights from these areas include the first 3 of 4 operated Dunvegan horizontal oil wells in the Kaybob area, with 1 well already in production. Initial oil rates range from 159 to 320 barrels of oil per day. Drilling of the fourth well and production start-up of all wells will occur in the fourth quarter. In the liquids-rich Bluesky area, we continued our horizontal program, completing 3 wells during the quarter. Very strong results received, particularly in the third well which tested at 11.7 million cubic feet of gas per day and 600 boe per day of liquids. Lastly, the Sparky program in the Consort area continues to play a significant role in our program. And during the quarter, we operated 3 rigs and drilled 24 wells. Oil production in Consort increased from 1,250 barrels of oil per day to 1,792 barrels of oil per day in the third quarter, of which Sparky program provided 300 barrels of oil per day, with 1/3 of the third quarter drills tied in and proving up. Production start-up of the remaining wells will occur in the fourth quarter. Moving outside North America in the North Sea. Third quarter production average 67,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day was down quarter-over-quarter due to turnarounds and continued challenges with ESP failures, as previously disclosed, resulting in deferrals of approximately 12,000 boe per day. All operated Forties platforms are back to full production, as are Scott and Telford. Nelson is scheduled to return to production in mid-November. During the quarter, the region operated 4 rigs and drilled in the produced 6 gross wells with 2 further wells in progress. Well highlights for the region included Bacchus West, the second-successful horizontal development well in the Bacchus Field. The well encountered 889 feet of net pay in the Jurassic Fulmar sandstone reservoir. It was completed in late July, with initial production of 8,500 barrels of oil per day gross. Apache is the operator in the field with a 50% working interest. The Bacchus Field commenced production in May of this year and is currently producing around 10,000 barrels of oil per day, 5,000 barrels a day net, through the subsea tie-back to Apache's Forties Alpha platform. Looking to Forties. We also brought on 3 new wells with average IP of 1,633 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We made continued progress on the installation of the Forties Alpha Satellite platform. The jacket was installed successfully west of the Forties Alpha platform on September 8. The platform topside will be lifted into place in the second quarter of 2013, followed soon thereafter by development drilling through its 18 well slots. We continue also to have drilling success in our Beryl field where, during the quarter, Apache's Beryl Bravo's B73-Y [ph] development well tested at 8,161 barrels of oil per day and 5.9 million cubic feet of gas per day from a Jurassic Manson [ph] reservoir containing 71 feet of net oil pay. The well began producing at the end of August. The well also encountered 245 feet of net pay in 3 additional zones that will be produced in a later date. We have a 50% interest in the well. The U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change announced this month the award of 11 new North Sea licenses to Apache, the highest of any operator participating in the 27th Seaward Licensing Round. These awards covered 19 full or partial blocks, 613,000 gross acres or 2,482 square kilometers. Included in these blocks is all the available acreage around our Beryl field plus 2 key licenses near Forties. Apache also was awarded an interest in another non-operated license. The economic prospectivity of these areas was enhanced by recent improvements in the U.K. tax allowance mechanism involving small fields in high-pressure, high-temperature formations. Looking to the fourth quarter, we plan to drill wells on Forties Charlie and Forties Echo as well as reinstating wells on Forties Bravo and Forties Delta. The Beryl Bravo platform will be down for a planned par [ph], which started 26 October, returning to full production on 22nd of November in order to perform routine maintenance. Turning to Egypt. Our operations continued unabated. We averaged 26 rigs operating and reported quarterly averaged net production of 153,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Because of the terms of our PSC to provide for lower nets with higher oil prices, we reported a 4% decrease in the preceding quarter. On a gross basis, however, we essentially held production flat. In addition, during the quarter, we saw record turnarounds on development lease approvals after seeing delays of 9 months or more during 2011. The most recent approvals for development leases took just 34 days, a positive sign that the new leadership at petroleum ministry EGPC is finally finding its footing. In Khalda, we had several discoveries of note this quarter, including the Samaha North 1X [ph] which drilled to a TD of 17,362 feet in the Lower Safa. The well encountered pay intervals in 4 zones, and a test is pending. The earlier discovery, Samaha 1X [ph], tested at a rate of 20.8 million cubic feet of gas per day and 913 barrel of condensate per day from the Lower Safa and 23 million cubic feet of gas per day and 1,997 barrels of condensate per day for the Upper Safa. And the Samaha East 1X [ph] tested at a rate of 28 million a day and 711 barrels of condensate for Lower Safa and 14.5 million cubic feet of gas per day and 1,110 barrels condensate for the Upper Safa. KPC or Khalda Petroleum Company's current oilfields also saw a high level of activity. During the quarter, a total of 13 wells were drilled or are currently being drilled in these properties. In the Eunice field, 7 wells were drilled, including 3 injectors. And recent initial tests of the Unis 2 Upper Bahariya reservoir resulted in 1,800 barrels of oil per day. The Eunice field started production this year and, as of October, is already producing in excess of 5,500 barrels of oil per day gross. Looking to Australia. We continue to make significant progress toward development of our large infrastructure projects in the region. The BHP-operated Macedon project is reported to be over 70% complete and on schedule for first gas in mid-2013, which will add approximately 45 million cubic feet of gas of net production when 2 new contracts come on in 2013 and 2014. All contracts have been executed on schedule for our Balnaves project, with the Armada Claire FPSO currently in the shipyard undergoing refurbishment and replacement construction preparing for Balnaves 2014 [indiscernible]. Our Julimar gas development in support of the Wheatstone LNG project is progressing on schedule, with recent contract awards announced for various subsea project components. Third quarter net production was 64,000 boe per day or 3% down from the previous quarter likely [ph] due to anticipated decline at the Van Gogh field. Looking ahead in the fourth quarter, 2 new wells both commenced at Stag in late October, while Van Gogh and Pyrenees are forecast to continue declining slowly through the remainder of the year. The first Stag well, the Stag 44H, came online this week and is currently producing 1,800 barrels of oil per day, adding to the Stag 45H production that came on the week before at around 1,500 barrels of oil per day. A planned turnaround of the Yara fertilizer plant that began in late September has experienced delays to an unexpected equipment failure. It is anticipated by our partner, the operator of the plant, to be offline until late November. Offsetting these deferred volumes at Yara are recently signed commercial gas contracts for additional Reindeer and John Brookes volumes in the fourth quarter. Finally, in Argentina, production during the quarter averaged 48,000 boe -- 48,500 boe per day, a 3% decline quarter-over-quarter. During the quarter, our total Gas Plus production averaged 111 million cubic feet of gas per day out of 214 million cubic feet of gas per day of total net production, with 98 million cubic feet of gas per day or 88% of the volume sold at Gas Plus prices which averaged $4.97 per Mcf. In the Neuquén Basin, we drilled and completed successfully the NL 62 well at 2.5 million a day from the pre-Cuyo formation. The well has been approved at Gas Plus, and we are currently selling gas at $5.47 per Mcf. In total, the Neuquén Basin 7 wells reached TD in the third quarter under Gas Plus, and a total of 8 wells were initially completed, delivering a combined growth rate of 17.1 million cubic feet of gas per day and 1,595 barrels of oil per day, which is 4,445 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As Steve already mentioned the encouraging initial results for our Vaca Muerta exploration program, I won't elaborate further here. That concludes our many operational highlights. And I'll now turn it over to Tom Chambers.
Thomas P. Chambers: Thanks, Rod. And good afternoon, everyone. As Steve and Rod mentioned, we are actively focused on our significant inventory of drilling opportunities and realizing the potential we've built through these acquisitions. Record rig counts continue to increase in our Permian and Central regions, and significant infrastructure investments in all the regions has set the groundwork for a positive momentum adding into year-end. Underpinning this activity is our ability to generate strong consistent revenues and cash flow. For the third quarter, we reported earnings of $161 million or $0.41 per diluted share and adjusted earnings of $861 million or $2.16 per share when we adjust for certain items that affect the comparability of results. Third quarter adjustments totaled $700 million and include a noncash property write-down in Canada, a change in tax rate on decommissioning expenditures for North Sea oil and gas facilities, a foreign currency fluctuation adjustment and some small merger acquisition and transition costs. The noncash after-tax write-down of our Canadian oil and gas properties totaled $539 million, which brings the year-to-date amount to $1.4 billion. Our Canadian regions reserves were over 77% natural gas at year-end 2011 and a decline in natural gas prices over the prior year continues to impact us under full-cost accounting rules. The other large noncash item impacting earnings was the $118 million charge related to decommissioning facilities in the North Sea. As you'll recall, in 2011, the U.K. increased the corporate income tax rate on North Sea oil and gas profits from 50s -- 50% to 62% and at that time also proposed that the tax relief attributable to decommissioning expenditures remain at 50%. The decommissioning-related legislation was not formally enacted but was included in the finance bill introduced in 2012 and enacted in July of this year, necessitating the change in the quarter. Production drove results in this quarter and fueled our -- fueled by our extensive drilling program. Production averaged 771,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, a strong performance despite downtime in the Gulf of Mexico associated with Hurricane Isaac and maintenance downtime in the North Sea. Higher oil prices contributed to the total revenue of $4.1 billion for the quarter and a record $12.6 billion on a year-to-date basis. This compares to $4 billion in the previous quarter and $12.5 billion year-to-date in 2011. Our revenues and, ultimately, our ability to maintain operating margins translates into cash from operations which totals $2.4 billion for the quarter. Cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital was 2% higher than the previous quarter. Year-to-date, our cash flow from operations was down only 2% over the prior year-to-date period despite lower worldwide price realizations, with natural gas and NGL prices down 16% and 27%, respectively, and oil prices up only 2%. International price realizations helped to mitigate the decline in the quarter in earnings and cash flow, with oil price realizations up 10% sequentially and 3% from the prior year quarter. Additionally, with Brent currently trading at over a $20 premium to WTI, we will continue to reap the benefits of our global oil position. International natural gas prices were up 3% from the prior quarter and 13% from the third quarter 2011. For the past 3 quarters, we have realized over $4 per Mcf on our international gas production, a significant premium to North American prices which average well below $3 per Mcf over the same time frame when we exclude the impact of hedges. International regions represent just over 1/3 of our worldwide gas production. A key point I'd like to emphasize is that both international oil and gas price realizations were 20% higher than North American average realizations, a true testament to our global portfolio of balance and reach. Our cash margins for the third quarter remained strong. At $41.54 per boe, our cash margins increased 5% from the sequential quarter but decreased almost 10% from the prior year period. Our cash costs were slightly higher than we would have liked to see this quarter, particularly lifting cost, which were primarily impacted by an increase in nonrecurring repairs and maintenance costs tied to corrosion repairs at our Grand Isle facilities and plant turnarounds in Canada and the North Sea. We also increased workover [ph] activity in nearly every region. Besides providing very good rate-of-return projects, they supported our base production. Coupled with the continued growth in our onshore North American operations, our labor costs have increased accordingly. As production rises in the fourth quarter and into next year, our rates should fall back accordingly. Rest assured we will remain focused on optimizing our margins and managing our costs while not compromising safety. You can find a detailed calculation of our margins, adjusted earnings and cash from operations in the financial supplement located on our website. Turning to the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet, with a debt-to-cap ratio of 27%. We ended the quarter with $318 million in cash and a total debt of $11.6 billion. Moving on to taxes. As I mentioned on the prior call, our earnings would be impacted this quarter by a change in U.K. tax law, which it was, and I detailed earlier in my comments. The third quarter effective tax rate of 79% was impacted by this charge in the Canadian ceiling test adjustment as well. Absent these adjustments and foreign exchange movements, our effective tax rate would have been a more typical 45%. We would expect a deferred tax percentage of approximately 20% for the year, absent these adjustments. In closing, we had another solid quarter of production revenues and cash flow driven by our drilling program. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Brady.
Brady Parish: All right. Thank you, Tom. That concludes our prepared remarks. I do want to apologize to the listeners on the call if you hear any background noise. But I'll turn it over to the operator now, and we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse.
Arun Jayaram - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Steve, we've seen some pretty interesting announcements regarding majors, including Exxon, I think, some pretty high valuations for Canadian gas acreage. I just wanted to see if you could maybe comment on some of the potential implications for Apache. Are there opportunities for you to monetize some of your acreage in places where you're not spending capital? And does this have any implications? Could you partner with Exxon regarding Kitimat where the market is concerned about?
G. Steven Farris: Two different questions. I'll take the first one, about the acreage. Interestingly -- and I think the number is correct because I asked our guys and gals in Canada. We have about 300,000 acres in that same play that just traded. And in fact, we're starting to drill some wells there at the end of this year and in the first of next year. How we actually exploit all of that acreage? We got 6.5 million acres in Canada and we just went through the same process that we've done in the Anadarko Basin and the Permian Basin in the -- in our Canadian region in terms of resource potential, and we're going to be rolling that out here in the coming months. But the potential for liquids and liquids-rich gas in Canada are actually much stronger than I thought they were. In terms of partnering with Exxon, I can't comment on that. But despite some of the things you hear in the press, we're -- Kitimat is still going forward, and we have -- we're very positive about it.
Arun Jayaram - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, I'll leave it at that. Obviously, Steve, this year, you've had some production disruptions. It sounds like those are in the rearview mirror. How comfortable are you, Steve, with your 6% to 9% target for 2013? And I just wanted to also see if we could get a little bit more color on the next couple of quarters for the North Sea given -- with the ESP issues back online, things like that. So some more color on the North Sea.
G. Steven Farris: Yes. In terms of -- there's nothing -- honestly, if you -- and I -- this is an excuse and I don't like to give excuses, but if you were to adjust our production, which you can't do because we didn't get the cash and we didn't get the production, but if you were to adjust it, we would have been right on our -- for the hurricane, which you can't do a damn thing about, and the events in the North Sea would be right on our production forecast. And I know that sounds like an excuse, but as we move to the drillbit, those kind of things, we've got to get over. We've got to get past those kind of things. So far, I will tell you, from an outlook for the fourth quarter, we're very positive about it. And there's nothing changed with respect to our forecast for 2013, 6% to 9%. I mean, I think we have the inventory and we have the asset base in order to do that.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.
Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: A question on Beryl. If anybody knows what the value of Beryl is, it's you folks. You saw Shell take out Hess' interest. What's the sense there? Why didn't you either match or beat the bid? And is that a sign that you got too many things to do and you don't want to do more bolt-on acquisitions?
G. Steven Farris: I really can't comment on that at the present time.
Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay, I'll try again, moving to a different country. Can you -- a bit more color on the Vaca Muerta then?
G. Steven Farris: Yes, I will. We're a -- it's a little early to give rates. I will tell you we were pleasantly surprised by the initial rates that we got out of that well. We've been -- we've had it on now almost a month. I will tell you, it's still making 300 barrels a day. And for a well that's been frac-ed 7 times in only 1,900 feet of lateral, it's -- we're very satisfied with it.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I -- a couple for me, please, if I may. Steve, it's obviously pretty nice to start seeing the momentum picking up in the Lower 48. Can you tell us where you see the rig count going in terms of relative capital allocation between, I guess, international and U.S., particular, Lower 48 in particular, 63 [ph] now. Where do you think that tops out? Or are you at a level now where you think you're -- you've got enough to say grace over?
G. Steven Farris: Well, I think -- as I said in my prepared remarks, I think you're going to see that momentum build. Certainly, from an opportunity standpoint, we have the opportunity to -- and I'm going to be redundant. But if you remember in 2010, we spent $500 million in the Permian, then we went to about $1 billion. This year, we're going to spend a little over $2 billion, and in next year, we're going to spend more than that. We'll probably run 40 rigs next year in the Permian. And the Anadarko Basin, our results there, actually better than we expected. So we're going to -- you're going to see an increase in the Anadarko Basin also, which speaks to the allocation of capital. Certainly, we haven't allocated our capital for 2013 yet. We're going to do that in December. But it's certainly -- we're going to put it into best projects, wherever those projects are.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And then Steve, this might be a dumb question as a follow-up, but I'm going to have a go, anyway. Your stock prices, when you did the BP deal last time, your share equity was above where the share price is now. You obviously -- you've done Analyst Day, you've given us insight to everything that's going on, and you spent a lot of money buying assets. As you say, you've got a very deep portfolio. One could argue that you could buy back reserves cheaper by buying back your own stock. I'm just curious as to how that plays into how you're thinking about trying to address some of the recent performance in the share price which seems to contrast with the tremendous portfolio you've built up.
G. Steven Farris: Yes, and I -- we've had this discussion before. I think, in terms of the rates that we're getting for the investment dollars that we have in our portfolio -- it's -- other than perception, would be rates of return, which would be cost of capital to buying our stock back. We're not -- at the present time, we're not considering diverting capital from the base program to buy our stock back.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So what do you think it is the market is missing here? Because I'm just really going to take your perspective as to how patient you're going to be on this.
G. Steven Farris: Well, I -- the -- I -- obviously, we're disappointed that we had the down time. I'm optimistic that we'll have a good quarter in the fourth quarter and I think we got to continue to post quarters.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company.
Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: I was just curious, just thinking broadly about 2013 CapEx spending. Is it roughly fair to think, in terms of it mirroring the growth in cash flow year-over-year, that it might move up in lockstep with that?
G. Steven Farris: Yes, we're going to -- we have the opportunity base. It's -- we're going to spend our cash flow in the E&P business.
Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: And then a second question is to follow up if you can kind of broadly compare and contrast the economics and opportunities of LNG projects in Australia versus those in Canada.
G. Steven Farris: Well, for different reasons, they're very similar, actually. I mean, obviously -- let's assume that the pricing of the LNG is exactly the same in Australia versus they are in Canada. I will tell you a -- the add-ons of trains in Canada would be much more lucrative than they would be in Australia just because of the cost. So that project really is a long-term project. And there's tremendous amount of gas in the United States and/or in British Columbia right now.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of John Freeman with Freeman James (sic) [Raymond James].
John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I didn't know that I took over the company. The -- on the North Sea, the 12,000 that was offline, the -- specifically just to the ongoing pump issues, how much of the 12,000 was related to just the pump issues?
Rodney J. Eichler: It's only about 2,000 or 3,000 barrels of oil per day specifically attributed to the pumps. We had 9 ESPs that were off and those are being cycled into the drilling, scheduled to be replaced, along with new drills that we do that -- based on economics so that -- we haven't got all of those 9 replaced yet, but they probably will be by the -- in the second quarter of 2013.
G. Steven Farris: But the real down -- production off was the -- was our turnaround at Alpha.
John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Right. And I think you all mentioned that Nelson returns in November. How much of a production impact is that?
Rodney J. Eichler: That's 1,900 barrels of oil a day net. And that's been down for about almost 100 days.
John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then last question for me, it's still on the North Sea. Did the 3D seismic killer [ph] you're shooting on Beryl, did that get completed last month?
G. Steven Farris: It's only partially completed. We have about -- 30% of it was acquired in the current shooting weather window this last summer. The balance of it we acquire in 2013.
G. Steven Farris: But the 40% is we're currently processing.
Rodney J. Eichler: Right.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale.
John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: Just some quick ones for me. With Suriname, will you shoot the seismic and then bring someone out to promote [ph] ?
G. Steven Farris: Yes, well, let me put it this way. We're not that -- we wouldn't go drill that well 100%. And we -- and -- but frankly, John, we've already had a lot of interest. That's a very good block, frankly.
John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: Yes, I would assume so. Yes, Atlantic margin turbidites are in. What about services cost, Steve? We're seeing -- or hearing on a lot of the other conference calls that prices for rigs and frac-ing are coming down. What are you seeing?
G. Steven Farris: Oh yes, they're -- actually, frac-ing costs came down really in the third quarter in a big way, and you're starting to see rigs come down. If you look at the rig count in the Permian Basin over the last 2 months, I mean we're -- it's the historic or the continuous ebb and flow of prices, service costs and capital. And what you're seeing right now is we were on the back end of all those service costs going up, we're on the front end of it now because we -- I think they'll continue to go down.
John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: Okay. Last one for me. Would you consider ever doing not a stock buyback but a more competitive common stock dividend? You've got a great balance sheet, you're very diversified and you're suffering benign neglect.
G. Steven Farris: I -- we did that many years ago, actually. And I mean, honestly, we consider pretty much all avenues of what -- how to reward our shareholders, frankly, from a cash dividend to a stock dividend to stock buybacks. And frankly, when you look at our portfolio, all we have to do now is deliver honestly. Our -- as I told our planning meeting group, we have 280 people in Dallas and we have nobody to look at but ourselves. We just need to perform because we've got the asset base and we've got the people, so...
John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: Okay, last one for me. Steve, would Mississippi Lime be a good water disposal access?
G. Steven Farris: I'm sorry. What, John?
John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: Would the Mississippi Lime be a good water disposal access, wells being wells.
G. Steven Farris: Yes, you're going to -- I mean, you're going to get -- yes, it would. I mean, that -- if you've looked at not just us but all the operators out there, that's a good oil play, but you've got to move a lot of water, which we anticipated.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Matt Portillo with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Just 2 quick questions for me. Firstly on the CapEx side. Looking at Q3, it looks like the run rate CapEx spend is about $2.7 billion for drilling and then also gathering. Is that a reasonable rate that we should think about going forward? And then as we head into 2013, kind of can you talk a little bit about the rig count that you're currently employing by basin and then -- and how that may change over time? I think you mentioned the Permian will increase to about 50% horizontal rig. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how those rigs are shifting around.
G. Steven Farris: I think we've got 34 rigs. I mean, I might be off one, but I think we have 34 rigs in the Permian. We've got 24 or 25 in the Anadarko Basin. I think we're up to 7 in Canada and we've got 8 offshore Gulf of Mexico. That's not exact, but that's pretty close.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Can you refresh us on Australia, on production trajectory and your latest thoughts on Van Gogh platform remediation and just what we should expect production trajectory-wise over the next 4 to 7 quarters?
G. Steven Farris: Yes. I mean, Van Gogh has been very good. It's paid out 9 months. We're still producing, I think, about 16,000, 17,000 barrels a day there. We have a turnaround on our FPSO coming in about the middle of -- I mean, middle of 2013. And the real reason that's important is we're going to -- when we bring it back. In the meantime, we're going to be drilling Coniston wells, which is a sister field to the north of Van Gogh that will start ramping up our oil production going through that FPSO. But frankly, we've seen the peaks of the production at both Van Gogh and Pyrenees. And the way we replace that is we've got Balnaves, which is about a 20-million-barrel oil field we should have on broad win [ph] 2014.
Thomas P. Chambers: 2014.
G. Steven Farris: 2014. We also got Macedon, which is gas, but it's not like North American gas. It is -- that contract is north of $7. So we've got Macedon coming on in the third quarter of 2013. So we've got -- we're going to see a little dip in Australia and then we're going to see a big ramp-up again.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And I guess, when we think about that ramp-up on the oil side, does that ramp-up just kind of get back to the levels that you've been producing, which has been relatively consistent for this year in the 28,000 to 30,000 barrels a day range? Or does it step up beyond that?
G. Steven Farris: Well, I don't have that. I can't answer that question. I just -- and it's not that I wouldn't, I just don't have it in front of me. I don't know what our profile looks like.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And lastly, in Egypt. Can you just talk to any discussions with the government you've had since your last update? And any thoughts on royalty rates and overall government take?
G. Steven Farris: Yes, I had. And in fact, both Rod and I spent a week in September in Egypt. I happen to be the Head of the U.S.-Egyptian Business Council. And we had 48 U.S. companies there, some of the largest companies in the world. We met with the president, the prime minister. I think we had government officials with us from the U.S. Quite frankly, we've been very pleased and very positive about not only that trip but our relationship with the government. Rod alluded to that we have a new Petroleum Minister, who is, frankly, a breath of fresh air. We've got more things done in the last 90 days than we got done in the last 2 years in terms of development leases approved, issues that we needed to get solved, a new gas contract at Hydra, so -- and honestly, I'm very positive about their direction, at least for our sector.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Eliot Javanmardi with Capital One Southcoast.
Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division: Yes, guys, just wanted to see if you could speak to the increase in LOE for this quarter. I noticed a significant amount of it was related to repair and maintenance, and just wanted to see if that would essentially roll off for next quarter and come back down?
Thomas P. Chambers: That will roll off next quarter. We had -- we talked about the Grand Isle 43 corrosion issue that we had. That production was off in the second quarter. That cost hit us in the third quarter, that's a onetime cost. And then we had the North Sea tire cost and some of the Canada SemCAMS plant downtime cost, turnaround costs in there as well. So those are all one-period type costs. So you should see that coming down. And with the production back up, the per boe should drop as well.
Eliot Javanmardi - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division: Very good. And also then in regards to exploration in Gulf of Mexico, what wells could we see just expecting to come forward then -- as far as results are concerned? Is there any left this year? Or is it in 2013? Do you have some 1Q '13?
G. Steven Farris: No, it's going to be -- it'll be 2013. We don't pick up our rate until, I think, the first quarter of 2013 for our drilling, our first prospects.
Rodney J. Eichler: In the deepwater.
G. Steven Farris: In the deepwater. We have a well going right now at Heidelberg, a development well by Anadarko -- I'm sorry, Lucius, that Anadarko is drilling, but that's development drilling. So you won't see any real impact from our drilling activity in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico until next year. And we're actively drilling shelf well, Gulf of Mexico shelf wells as we speak.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Back to the Permian Basin. It -- kind of the Midland, parts of the [ph], I guess I'll call it the Deadwood area. What would you characterize as your best part of the basin?
G. Steven Farris: Well, I'll tell you, it's hard to tell. I mean, we thought the stuff we were doing down in the -- hang on one second. I've got -- now he's going to give me a chart here. Well, actually the best results we've had so far in the individual wells is the Wolfcamp Shale, but I don't know that, if you caught -- if we drilled a well on the Central Basin platform in the Wichita Albany, those wells came on 900 barrels a day, still making about 8 -- over 600 barrels a day, both of them. And we have about 23 locations to drill in there. So the one thing I would say about the Permian Basin and the reason we started getting in there in 1991 and made a number of acquisitions before we made BP is exactly where we are today: We've got a tremendous acreage position. It is the oiliest place in North America, oiliest place in the world outside of Russia. So it has a lot potential for horizontal drilling. And I think Rod mentioned we're going from -- I don't -- we're going to drill 123 wells this year horizontal. Next year, we're -- it's going to be more like half of our wells. We're just on the cusp. Not just us, everybody is, in terms of understanding the Permian Basin and the kind of oil that's out there.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then a follow-up. You guys talked about -- at the Analyst Day talked about some similar basin, drilling you're doing, it was 15 to 20 wells you're going to drill out there. Any comment -- and maybe I missed it in the prepared remarks, but any comment on kind of overall the results from that program and what you're seeing over there?
Rodney J. Eichler: As I said in my prepared remarks, in the Delaware, the Yeso, in particularly [indiscernible] is our principal area outside the Central Basin Platform in the Midland Basin. The program there has been vertical up to this point, but will be turning horizontal soon. It certainly met our expectations per drill.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, okay. So you're just -- you got nothing from the Avalon and Bone Spring.
Rodney J. Eichler: No, it's -- the main part of the Delaware is the Bone Spring for you. It's a modest part of our portfolio compared to the other drilling we've been doing out in the basin.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division: I was curious, is there an update you can share with us on the Mbawa well offshore Kenya and, if you have any results or indication there, what the implications might be for the [indiscernible]?
G. Steven Farris: I think we've talked about it at the last conference, I mean, call. But we found gas. It had a real chance of finding gas. We thought we'd find an oil leg. We drilled on big structure, we found some gas. That's not what we were looking for. We're now reevaluating that block. We got 1 million acres there. So we're reevaluating that block. I happened to see we're too low, just drilled another oil well onshore Kenya. But we're -- this -- what we were looking for is not in the same horizon that Tullow is drilling onshore. And I think they're in the Cretaceous.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division: My apologies if I missed that. And the follow-up question, going back to the Permian Basin. Are -- you mentioned there are -- you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks some good Cline results, I thought. And I wondered if you could offer your thoughts on the relevant maturity and attractiveness of the Cline horizontal play versus the Wolfcamp horizontal play.
G. Steven Farris: I think Rod pointed out that well is making 600 barrels a day. So it tested -- first 30 days, I think, 600 barrels a day. And I -- and if you look at our acreage position and what we showed at the resource potential and what we're looking at now, I mean, it's different. It's bigger because what we found is just -- we drilled the Barnett Shale well in the Deadwood area. We didn't drill it that far horizontal, it's made 300 barrels a day. I'll go back to my statement from a question earlier, and that is, we -- as an industry, we haven't yet fully evaluated the most important plays in the Permian Basins. And I'll go back to the Wichita Albany. I mean, I'm shocked that the Wichita Albany is making 900 barrels a day.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Mario Barraza with Tuohy Brothers.
Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Just had a question more on the -- was it the cottage? I'm sorry.
G. Steven Farris: Cottage Grove? Hello?
Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: The activity for this level in the Granite Wash?
G. Steven Farris: Well, we drilled a couple of Cottage Grove wells. Actually, more than that, I think we drilled 4. It's a very good play. The Anadarko Basin has sands from the Tonkawa all the way down to the Atoka, and as you get deeper, it gets gassier. But that's another area that we've just scratched the surface as an industry and finding things, like Hogshooter. I mean, we go down there and drill a couple of Hogshooter wells and 2 or 3 of them make 4,000 barrels a day. And I can't emphasize enough, you want to be in basins that have a lot of thickness and a lot of hydrocarbons, and we're in 2 of the best. And I will tell you, one of these days, the western sedimentary basin of Canada is going to look like this. They're just way -- they're a lot further back in terms of their learning curve and exploiting it.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Wanted to dig into each of the [indiscernible] a little bit more here. So if I'm looking at the numbers right, your gross oil production on a gross basis in Egypt has kind of dropped for it looks like the past 4 quarters here. That had been an area that you had grown for years and years and it's kind of reversed trend. Has that been kind of a slowdown with the transition government you talked about? Maybe getting more traction here with the new energy minister? How should we expect gross Egyptian oil production to sort of change gears [ph] again into '13?
G. Steven Farris: Yes, and we're going to have to put on a little presentation. It's -- or maybe put something out. Actually, our gross production, gross operated production in Egypt is higher than it was at the beginning of the year. And our gross operated gas is higher than it was. What happens is, is that you get -- because of the way that the concession agreement works, if -- the price of crude oil has an awful lot to do with what you report for net production. So we need to start putting out our gross production and our net production because it's -- Egypt is still very good and going to continue to be good. And we're going to continue to see bumps in our net production based on oil prices.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, I guess I was looking at some of those numbers in your supplement, and I guess maybe I was looking at them wrong. But I saw you did 211,000 gross barrels a day this quarter. And I saw like...
Rodney J. Eichler: No, that’s about right. And what do we do in the quarter before, 216?
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I saw 215 in the first quarter of '12 and it was, like, 220 in the third quarter of '11. So it's kind of been slowly coming down. So I wasn't sure if that was sort of a Permian issue or bottlenecks or you guys just weren't...
G. Steven Farris: Yes, there's -- some of that is. I will tell you. Yes, we had a plant turnaround at Terric [ph] for the third quarter.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, got you. And you mentioned getting good traction in last 90 days with the new Petroleum Minister over there. I guess, do you expect that to really kind of change things as we get into 2013 in Egypt for you?
G. Steven Farris: Right. I -- we've got 26 rigs running. We -- it still gives us the highest rate of return in the company. And I don't -- that's probably what we're going to run all of next year.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. I guess, looking at your gas production in Egypt, the other thing I noticed was that it looked like your net take in the third quarter was a fair bit lower, I'm seeing about 36% of the gas versus the gross. And previously, it had always kind of been 40% or higher. Is there anything in particular that happened in the third quarter? Should we expect it to stay at that kind of a 36% level going forward, or is that going to rebound? How should we think about that?
Rodney J. Eichler: There's been no material change in the gross gas production, except for the turnaround we just mentioned. Some of this is PSC related and which Steve just mentioned. But I should point out that the value of the gas, all that gas we produce in Egypt, is only about 18% on a revenue basis compared to the value of the oil. So all the value in Egypt is coming from the oil and condensate we produce.
Operator: Our final question will come from the line of Robert Christensen with Buckingham Research.
Robert L. Christensen - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: A little bit more on the Williston Basin, if you might. Just you've got, I think, 3 permits, maybe 1 well drilled and testing. And just a little more color on that, that's question one. Question two, I've heard you've been actively leasing up there even more land. And question three, have there been any other well results by other companies that have been encouraging to you?
G. Steven Farris: We are in the process, actually, of frac-ing our first well up there and we're drilling our second well. I think, yesterday, we were at 2,700 feet. So we're going to have 2 wells down by the end of the year. We're not picking up big amounts of acreage before filling into the land block that we've put together, which is -- I think is about 300,000 acres or so. And there have been some other operators, it's not right next door, that have announced pretty good results. I mean, the play is moving that way, so hopefully, it moves all our way. We're going to find out here pretty quick.
Operator: I would now turn the conference back over to Brady Parish for any closing remarks.
Brady Parish: We just wanted to thank everybody for participating today. And have a great remaining week.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you, all, for joining. And you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Patrick Cassidy, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Patrick Cassidy: Thank you, Regina. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we reported earnings of $337 million or $0.86 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $821 million or $2.07 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations totaled $2.4 billion for the quarter. On today's call, we will have 3 speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. First, we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer; and finally, Tom Chambers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We prepared our quarterly supplemental data package for your use, which also includes a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or pretax margins. This data package can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financialdata. Today's discussions may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions, and no assurances can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
G. Steven Farris: Thank you, Patrick, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm sure all of you have seen that in our recent Investor Day, we outlined our extensive oil and liquids drilling inventory in the onshore U.S. We have over 67,000 future drilling locations that have been technically assessed, and we also have 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent net unbooked inventory that is available to drive our growth in the years to come. And this inventory is already beginning to deliver meaningful results in our onshore. During the second quarter, our Permian and Central regions grew net production at annualized base of 23% and 18%, respectively, and this was before the contribution of Cordillera assets that we acquired at the end of April. Obviously, not every quarter's going to be as good, but we're firmly on track to deliver the double-digit growth in these regions for the years to come, as we outlined in our Investor Day. Moreover, if you count the land drilling rigs operating in the United States from the Rockies to East Coast, Apache has 62 rigs running, which is the second most active operator out of all the independents and majors, and that's only behind Chesapeake, which really has a different focus and business model. I might point out that not a single 1 of the 62 rigs is drilling a gas target. We said we were going to step up our U.S. drilling activity to exploit our enlarged portfolio, and we're doing just that. Our total reported production in the second quarter was reduced by a 16 -- which is the difference between a hit and a miss on our production growth. We had offline about 16,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. This includes 4,800 barrels a day due to unscheduled downtime at our third-party operated SemCAMS plant in Kaybob in Canada. We had 2,000 barrels of oil a day down in the Gulf Coast Onshore due to a third-party pipeline outage in the Lake Paige Field, 3,200 barrels of downtime due to unscheduled facility repairs at Grand Isle 43, which is the complex in the Gulf of Mexico, and 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day out of service due to ESP failures at the Forties Field. Most of the 16,000 barrels a day is already back on stream or is expected to be back before the end of the year. I know downtime happens it's part of our business. The important thing is that we have a robust portfolio. So it really doesn't impact us over the longer term with the performance of the company. We remain on track to deliver our production growth guidance in 2012 without any need to significantly increase our capital program for the year. We have a very active exploration program through the rest of the year, and we expect to further accelerate our exploration activities in next year and beyond. I'm sure most of you have read in the Gulf of Mexico, we have expanded our exploration block portfolio by 40%. We were the most active bidder in the Central Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale held in June. We picked up 90 blocks, 61 on the shelf and 29 in the deepwater. We're excited about the prospects we've identified on the blocks that we've won and expect to ramp up our exploration activity in the Gulf of Mexico significantly over the coming quarters. We've already secured one new build semisubmersible deepwater rig, which will be dedicated, it is separate and it should be delivered in the middle of 2013. In Kenya, our offshore Mbawa well prospect is expected to spud in about 10 days. We should have results by our earnings call in November. We're -- this month, we're deploying one rig in the Mississippian Lime where we've built [ph] 580,000 net acres. We're also deploying one rig in the Williston Basin, where we have secured a new exploration position of about 300,000 acres. Both of these we're expected to drill 4 to 6 wells at each one of these 2 exploration plays over the next 6 months. We also plan to spud our first Alaska Cook Inlet well in October. So we're very enthusiastic about Apache's enlarged portfolio, what we're delivering and what's ahead of us. We've already become one of the most active U.S. onshore drillers among our peers in the majors, and we're pursuing an exciting portfolio of global exploration opportunities. We're doing this all while maintaining our rate of return focus and the financial discipline that are defining characteristics of Apache. I'd like to turn the call over to Rod Eichler.
Rodney J. Eichler: Thank you, Steve. I'll begin with onshore North America as it was the focus of our recent Investor Day conference and is the area where we are currently most active. In the Permian, we reached a company milestone in the second quarter with production surpassing 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day marker for the full 3-month period. During the second quarter of 2012, net production was up 5.3% over the previous quarter at 104,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 72% was liquid and more than 3/4 of that was crude oil. Also included in total volumes are nearly 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of positive prior period adjustments, the majority of which are attributed to non-operated fields. Drilling at Deadwood in the Midland Basin and the Glasscock County continues to be a large contributor to growth, with horizontal drilling in the Wolfcamp emerging as a new development area. For the quarter, Permian averaged 32 drilling rigs, up 4 from the previous quarter, on the base properties, adding 187 wells, of which 167 were vertical and 20 were horizontal. We are currently running 36 rigs. Other than 2 weeks of working inventory, we have almost no backlog of stimulation jobs. In the Deadwood vertical play, we are targeting Wolfwood, that is the Wolfwood through the Wolfcamp reservoirs, and Fusselman vertical wells. We've had several notable test results with wells flowing in excess of 300 to 400 barrels of oil per day for intervals covering the Wolfwood reservoirs. We also have a number of locations where we'll initially complete only the deeper Fusselman formation and recompleted later at Wolfwood formations at hole [ph]. Our Amberjack well is a Fusselman-only completion and tested at a rate of 285 barrels of oil per day plus 180 Mcf per day. These add volumes at a very low cost, boosting the well's EUR and rate of return. We estimate that 1 out of 5 Deadwood wells can produce from the Fusselman. We're currently drilling primarily in 40-acre spacing at Deadwood, testing some 20 for down-spacing. This program is expected to remain active through 2012, drilling more than 300 wells in the second half of the year. In our Wolfcamp Shale play in Irion County, our 4 Wolfcamp horizontals have produced more than 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent since March 19. These are outstanding wells, all upper Wolfcamp producers, nothing in the liminal [ph] zones. This appears to be a very thick, very brittle shale and breaks nicely with fracture stimulation. We currently have 3 rigs running in the play and have already drilled 5 additional wells, which are currently being completed or expected to be completed soon. Turning now to our Central region in Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. Second quarter production averaged 55,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 47% increase over the preceding period. Nearly 30% of that production was liquids as the region continues its transition to oil and liquid-rich plays. A total of 28 wells were completed in the period, with 12 in the Granite Wash formation, averaging a 30-day IP rate of 1,625 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 54% is liquids. We also completed 10 Tonkawa wells with an average 30-day IP rate of 310 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and these are 80% liquid producers. I continue to be impressed with our Bivins Ranch development in the Texas Panhandle. Apache holds a 74% working interest in 124,000 contiguous acres at Oldham, Hartley and Potter counties. We have completed 8 out of our first 9 Canyon Wash tests. 6 wells averaged more than 400 barrels of oil per day for the first 30 days. Our 2 newest wells, completed in the last couple of weeks, are currently testing just under 700 barrels and roughly 1,000 barrels of oil per day. We have just completed installation of a 10-inch pipeline and gathering system and are now selling 3,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day from Bivins Ranch. Look for even more results in the future as a second rig is scheduled to arrive in Bivins Ranch in mid-September. Assimilation of the Cordillera operations is fully underway. We started the period with 10 rigs, averaged 19 for the quarter and exited with 22, and we're currently at 24. Before moving to the Gulf of Mexico, I want to comment briefly about onshore cost and takeaway capacity. We're seeing some softening for service cost across the board. Historically, we've seen cost come down on a lower commodity price environment. Our activity level and growth plans provide us with the flexibility to adjust our operations as circumstances change. Our drilling program is based on our rate of return, not on commodity prices. If trends continue, we expect to maintain or even increase our activity into these market conditions. We also have not had any material issues involving NGLs, but as -- Apache has been very proactive in securing market-sourced liquids where possible. For example, we've headed into a joint venture to build a new gas processing plant and to rail NGLs to the Gulf Coast. We have continued to work with other Permian Basin midstream players that control Apache NGLs to secure unconventional means to avoid product curtailments due to NGL constraints. Turning to the Gulf of Mexico shelf. We TD'd 7 wells during the quarter and operated 5 rigs with 83% success rate. Our production for the second quarter of 98,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was down 7% over the previous quarter. Downtime at the Grand Isle 43 complex for repairs and maintenance impacted our production during the period. Third-party pipeline and host facility downtime during Tropical Storm Debbie also deferred volumes. These shut-ins were partially offset by new pipeline installations at Vermillion 380 and Ship Shoal 91 and new wells at both Eugene Island 330 and Main Pass 308. Grand Isle 43AA facilities began ramping back up last week and is expected to be at the full rate over 7,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day net later this month. Notable drilling activities during the quarter, including a well at Main Pass 308, which IP'd at more than 900 barrels of oil per day. We have 4 additional locations drilled there. We also successfully drilled 2 wells at the Main Pass 311 and 314 area, finding 120 feet and 39 [ph] feet of pay, respectively, and are in process of completing there. On the regulatory front, 17 of 61 blocks where we were the high bidder of the June lease sale had been awarded so far. The permitting environment continues to be improve, both for drilling and exploration plans. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, production increased 13% from the previous quarter to 15,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The Mandy subsea tie-back project in Mississippi Canyon 199 came online, producing 5,000 barrels of oil per day and 3.5 million cubic feet of gas per day gross. We hold a 50% working interest in 2 wells in this field and a 15% override in a third. Our Geauxpher well, Garden Banks 462 continues to produce, holding up the start of our Bushwood development in the adjacent block, Garden Banks 463. We are ready to commence production once the Geauxpher well is completed, Bushwood is expected to IP at about 50 million cubic feet of gas per day, and we hold a 50% working interest. Development continues at Lucius and Keathley Canyon 875 with spar and topside construction in progress and major service and equipment contracts awarded. We expect development drilling to commence in the second half of the year with initial production still expected by year-end 2014. Our Deepwater team is also very active in the Central Gulf of Mexico lease sale, bidding on 43 blocks, 19 with partners. We were the -- high bidder on 29 blocks, and 3 have been awarded to date. We have identified 20 new prospects on these blocks, 17 of which will be Apache-operated. In our Gulf Coast Onshore region, production in the second quarter was 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 11% sequentially due primarily to third-party pipeline issues to Lake Paige Field in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. We anticipate Lake Paige being brought back online by mid-August, according to latest reports from the pipeline operator. During the quarter, we ran 3 operated rigs, drilling a total of 18 wells with an 89% success rate. One well to highlight is our Chaplin [ph] Ranch in Oasis County, Texas, which came on at 9 million a day and 1,020 barrels of oil per day. Turning to Canada. The region's drilling program continues to focus on oil and liquids-rich gas plays. The second quarter coincides with traditional spring breakup season, which impacts our drilling activity. So we saw our production declined 3.8% to 123,100 barrels oil equivalent per day as we drilled only 5 wells during the period. Our drilling is ramping back up in the third quarter targeting oil and liquids-rich gas. We plan to drill 20 Viking horizontals and 39 wells in Consort. In Midale, we expect to drill 4 additional horizontals. Moving on to the international areas. In the North Sea, production was up 36% over the prior year quarter as we continued to assimilate the Beryl properties. We are following up on the Beryl Bravo B72 well with the B73. As you may recall, B72 tested in excess of 11,600 barrels of oil per day and 15 [ph] million cubic feet of gas. The B73 accounted 358 feet of net pay TBD in 4 zones, and it is planned to come onstream during the third quarter. Looking forward to new prospects, the Beryl 3D seismic campaign will begin in early August and continue through until mid-October. The Bacchus Field commenced production during the second quarter. This is the first subsea tie-back to the Forties Field. The second horizontal well, Bacchus West, penetrated Jurassic-aged Fulmar reservoir sandstones and logged 889 feet measured depth of net pay of 3 Fulmar sections. Both Bacchus wells are now online flowing at a combined gross rate of nearly 13,000 barrels of oil per day. Following completion operations at Bacchus, the rig will move to appraise the Aviat shallow gas accumulation. Turning now to Egypt. We are operating a record number of rigs, 28, in the Western Desert. During the second quarter, we drilled 68 wells, including 16 exploratory wells, with 13 successes. Second quarter production declined from the preceding period, primarily due to planned shutdowns at our Salam gas plant where preventative maintenance was undertaken on trains 1 and 2, resulting in the 13 days of downtime. Among the drilling highlights were an exploration well on our West Kalabsha Concession at Faghur Basin that tested 1,600 barrels of oil and 730 Mcf of gas per day from the Jurassic Upper Safa. At our Khalda area concessions, we drilled our first Jurassic discovery at Alamein Basin, identifying 5 hydrocarbon-bearing passages in the Upper and Lower Safa. We're currently planning to test this well but it requires high-pressure equipment as it is the deepest well drilled to date by Khalda Petroleum Company.  An exploratory well, the Hot 1-x [ph] was drilled in WD 30 development lease at the Abu Gharadiq Basin, testing nearly 3,000 barrels of oil per day. This success high-grades numerous nearby oil-prone prospects. Also in this basin of the WD 30 development lease, Shadow 1X encountered 62 feet of gas and oil pay, testing an initial daily rate of 1,200 barrels of oil and 6.5 million cubic feet of gas per day. In the Khalda Offset Concession, we conducted production tests from the first 2 producer wells in the Utis [ph] field during the quarter, with each producing in excess of 2,000 barrels of oil per day. This is a traditional core KPC property, and we have 12 more wells approved for the field. We are seeing a shift to more complex drilling agent, particularly at Khalda. This includes record-setting drilling depths, new frac records with parts at deeper zones and high pressures at our first horizontal well, which we plan to frac and test in the third quarter. During the quarter, we continued to make progress on a number of commercial issues. This includes the signing of 5 new gas sales agreements at Highford [ph], Utis [ph], Sultan, Alpha and Chelsea, which should allow us for the debottlenecking of gas production in those concessions. And our Hydra [ph] development lease was signed, commercializing this 200-plus Bcf gas and condensate discovery. Hydra [ph] is expected to come on stream by year-end 2013, producing at an expected rate of 11,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In Australia, the second quarter net production was 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 3% from the first quarter largely due to forecasted declines in major oil producers, Pyrenees and Van Gogh, and seasonal reductions in gas purchases by industrial customers. Van Gogh production averaged 10,700 barrels of oil per day during the period. Uptime has been excellent, and the facility produced continuously throughout the quarter. On July 5, 2012, Apache achieved a milestone when it took over operatorship of the Ningaloo Vision FPSO from the previous contract operator. We purchased this FPSO vessel earlier this year. Looking ahead to the third quarter, production from the new Pyrenees Stickle 8H well commenced on July 14 and added an incremental 11,000 barrels of oil per day or 3,135 barrels of oil per day net to Apache to the total field production. Gas sale volumes in Australia will be reduced in late September when the Yara Pilbara fertilizer plant shuts down for maintenance. It is expected to be offline for approximately 3 weeks. Yara Pilbara normally takes 75 million to 80 million cubic feet of gas per day, Apache's share being 80%. Finally, in Argentina, net production in the second quarter was 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 5% increase over the Q1 2012. Our gas price realizations in Argentina continue to be supported by the Gas Plus Program. Our second quarter gas realizations where $2.76 per Mcf. And in June, we sold 97 million cubic feet of gas per day at an average of $4.96 per Mcf under the Gas Plus program. In Tierra del Fuego, the elimination of an existing provincial tax benefit reduced our average oil price realizations in the region by 30%, contributing to a reduction in the overall Argentina oil price realization to $72.69 per barrel. On the exploration front, seismic sequence mapping, petrophysical modeling, core [ph] descriptions and mud log analysis have helped to high-grade recompletion candidates, and identifying sweet spots within the Vaca Muerta as we look to identify horizontal drilling locations. We plan to drill 4 horizontal and 2 vertical exploration wells and to conduct 6 vertical rig completions with 10 fracs in 2012. The first horizontal well was spud within a week and is expected to be completed in September. We are hoping to have more well results to disclose in the first quarter of 2013 Exploration work continues on the Huacalera and Cortadera blocks to identify additional intervals to the Vaca Muerta we're testing at Huacalera X1. In conclusion, across our portfolio, we have no shortage of opportunities and the ramp-up of our drilling program is well underway. Our major prospects are progressing and on schedule. With results of our accelerated drilling activity beginning to take hold, we anticipate most of our 2012 growth to be in the second half of the year. That concludes the operational highlights, and I'll now turn it over to Tom Chambers.
Thomas P. Chambers: Thanks, Rod, and good afternoon, everyone. As you've read previously in our press release and heard earlier on the call, we are rapidly building a significant inventory of drilling opportunities and have established a robust platform for long-term growth across all of our regions. We achieved solid production level this quarter averaging 774,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day despite some significant third-party challenges. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of production growth, and we exit the quarter with continued upward momentum. For the second quarter, we reported earnings of $337 million or $0.86 per diluted share and adjusted earnings of $821 million or $2.07 per share, and we adjust for certain items that affect the comparability of results such as the noncash property write-down in Canada and foreign currency fluctuations. Our bottom line results were impacted by lower commodity prices, yet we were still able to generate revenues of almost $4 billion. This translates directly into significant cash flow from operations, $2.4 billion this quarter. Year-to-date, our cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital was 3% higher than the prior year-to-date period. On the quarter, our cash flow from operations was down 10% over the previous quarter, primarily driven by lower oil and gas price realizations, which were down 12% and 8%, respectively. International gas prices helped mitigate the decline in earnings and cash flow, with realizations up slightly from the previous quarter and 29% higher than North American average realizations. For the past 2 quarters, we have realized over $4 per Mcf on our international production, a sharp contrast to the North American prices, which averaged well below $3 per Mcf over the same timeframe without the benefit of hedges. Year-over-year, we produced 100 million cubic feet a day of additional international gas. And in the second quarter, it represented 37% of our worldwide gas production. As economic uncertainties continue to weigh on commodity prices in the global economy, we remain optimistic given our ability to consistently generate cash from operations. Our position is supported by the strength of our portfolio, which has enabled us to benefit substantially from our oil position and the fact that oil currently sells for nearly 30x the price of North American natural gas. Our efforts to expand our North American liquids portfolio was also evident this quarter as we closed the Cordillera acquisition in April for approximately $2.6 billion in cash and approximately 6.3 million common shares. This significantly increased our Central region's liquids production, 60% over the first quarter and added over 300,000 net acres to our prolific Granite Wash play in the surrounding areas. We were also able to secure a significant number of offshore blocks in the deepwater and shelf regions through the Gulf of Mexico offshore lease sale in June. This provides more growth potential in these regions where we received some of our highest liquids prices in America. In fact, over 40% of our North American oil production comes from our Gulf Coast regions, where average crude price realizations currently reflect over a 20% premium to West Texas Intermediate pricing. Our focus on oil and liquids will continue given the general weakness in North American gas markets. As a result, we again had a noncash write-down of our Canadian oil and gas properties. Our Canadian region is the most gas levered of our portfolio, and we recognized a $480 million after-tax write-down of the property balance during the quarter. As a reminder, full cost accounting rules require us to discount our proved reserve value at 10% using prices in effect for the past 12 months. The amount of our recorded book value over this discounted value is written off. This is a noncash event that will continue to impact us until North American gas prices no longer decline compared to the prior year. Excluding the write-down, our margins for the second quarter remain strong. At $39.72 per boe, we're still realizing robust cash margins despite the 12% decline in average price realizations. You can find a detailed calculation of our margins, adjusted earnings and cash from operations in the financial supplement located on our website. For the second quarter, you'll specifically notice an increase in our debt. Our strong balance sheet enabled us to reach into the debt market to fund significant acquisition activity. In April, we issued $3 billion of debt in 3 separate tranches at very attractive rates to fund the cash portion of the Cordillera acquisition and repay $400 million of higher interest rate notes that came due in April. We finished the quarter with a debt-to-cap of 25%, cash on the balance sheet of $360 million, which is $116 million higher than the prior quarter; and available borrowing capacity of nearly $3 billion. So we remain to have a flexible balance sheet. Turning to taxes. The second quarter effective tax rate of 56% reflects the Canadian ceiling test adjustment, as well as higher-taxed foreign earnings. Absent the Canadian write-down and the impact of foreign exchange movements, our effective tax rate would have been a more typical 43%. Similarly, these adjustments impacted our percentage of deferred taxes in the quarter. However, we would expect a deferred rate of 20% to 25% for the year, absent these adjustments. As we head into the third quarter, our income taxes will be impacted by the U.K. government provision to decrease tax relief attributable to decommissioning expenditures on the North Sea oil and gas facilities from 62% to a maximum of 50%. The legislation was enacted in July of 2012. And as a result, we will record a deferred tax charge in the third quarter of 2012 estimated at approximately $40 million. To wrap up, we had another quarter of solid production and cash flow. Apache is not immune to the current commodity price pressures faced by the industry, but we are optimistic about the second half of 2012, given our ability to deliver strong cash margins with a rising inventory of drilling prospects. We are actively increasing our activity across a board -- a broad portfolio of opportunities and are confident our results will reflect continued growth and value to our shareholders over the longer term. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Patrick.
Patrick Cassidy: Thank you, Tom. We will now open the call to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Arun Jayaram with Crédit Suisse.
Arun Jayaram - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I'm wondering, Steve or Rod, if you could give us a little bit of a road map relative to the near-term production picture. The guidance is 6% to 9%. I know that's adjusted for asset sales, but the way I'm thinking about it is you produced about 748,000 barrels last year. If you back out 11,000 from asset sales and then you apply the 6% to 9% range, so that would put you in the 781,000 to 803,000 [ph] kind of range in terms of thousand barrels a day, is that how you're thinking about 2012?
G. Steven Farris: We'd better hit that.
Arun Jayaram - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Okay. And obviously, Steve, you highlighted you had quite a bit of production, 16,000 barrels come online, and you said most of that's come back. I don't know if you could give us a little bit of specificity around when that came back and just so we can kind of fine-tune our third quarter and Q4 numbers.
G. Steven Farris: Yes, Rod -- I'll mention a couple of them, and then Rod will obviously give some more detail. But SemCAMS plant in Calgary went on, in Canada, went on, on July 6. So we should get all of that back. Now that's -- you've got all kinds of things going on in terms of it, but we -- that plant is back on. That was about 70 million a day. It was a big hit. We should have Lake Paige on about the middle of August. Grand Isle -- I mean, West Camp 43 is ramping back up. In fact, it should be back up right as we speak. It started ramping up about the fourth of July, and that was very unexpected downtime. Lake Paige was totally unexpected. We had a confluence of things that hit us all in one quarter, which you usually get over the whole year. In terms of the North Sea, we're doing 2 things. One is we're going in and replacing ESPs or pulling ESPs on the Forties. But we also got, as Rod pointed out, we just had the Bacchus well come on. And also our Beryl well hopefully will come on, Rod, in the middle of this month?
Rodney J. Eichler: Yes, yes.
G. Steven Farris: And we're expecting great things out of it. So.
Arun Jayaram - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. It sounds like you got a lot -- most of that coming back on track this quarter. My follow-up is, obviously you talked quite a bit at the Analyst Meeting about the Permian and the Cline Shale, and the horizontal Wolfcamp, that results looked pretty positive. As you think about next year, I know it's early but I was just wondering how you're thinking about activity in each of those plays and broadly into the Permian into 2013?
G. Steven Farris: Well, we're running 36 rigs in the Permian Basin right now, and honestly, you're going to see -- I mean, it's not a lack of inventory. So you're going to see that ramp up, and I think right now, I think Alfonso's plan had it at 40 rigs next year. That's probably conservative. In terms of the Anadarko Basin, we're running 26 rigs right now. And frankly, that's higher than we had in our outlook for the Investor Day. So we're -- I think in the Investor Day, we showed that the Permian would grow on an annualized rate over a 5-year period of about 13% and the Central region, if you don't include the Cordillera, our 5-year growth would be about 23%. And we're very comfortable with those 2 numbers.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.
John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Just a follow-up on the last question again on the downtime. I didn't quite hear the 6,000 that's offline on the Forties. Just a ballpark idea of when that returns.
Rodney J. Eichler: That Forties production is we have 9 ESPs that are principally off the Beryl -- I'm sorry, off the Forties Bravo platform. Those are being restored in sequence that we've fired up the platform drilling rig here on the late part of the second quarter. So we're swapping in the ESP replacements with new well -- new drilled wells. Whichever has the highest rate of return to us gets the favored treatment. So we're probably seeing those ESPs return in production through the rest of this year and perhaps even in the first quarter, intermixed with normal drilling activity on the same platform. I should note that the ESP run life out there is typically about 680 days, and that gives you an idea that about 2 years ago, most of those ESPs replaced in the last cycle, and so they all start falling about the same time.
John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: That helps. Of the incremental rigs that you added in the Permian going from 31 to 36, the 5 that were added, are they being focused mainly horizontal or can you give me maybe the current mix?
G. Steven Farris: One of them is in Wolfcamp, and then 2 of them are in Deadwood, and I don't know where the other 2 are off the top of my head.
Rodney J. Eichler: Just a second. I'll look it up for you.
John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: And while you're all looking for that, just the last question I had while you're looking at that. The well in Kenya that I believe was supposed to be spudded at the end of July, has that well been spud?
G. Steven Farris: No. In fact, I think it's going to be spud on August 15.
Operator: Your next question will come from...
Rodney J. Eichler: We currently have 6 horizontal wells operating in the Permian, they're scattered at the moment among the leased properties. So we have 2 rigs operating in the Wolfcamp Shale, which is a new area of expansion for us south of Deadwood, and we see that to be a continuing area of increasing drilling focus in the coming year.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I'm going to try a couple as well, if I may. I guess on the first question that was asked about production. I wonder if I can just push you a little bit on that because clearly if you get the target, to stay within target this year, it looks at least on our numbers that you'd get on to a fairly big step-up in the second half. Can you give us an idea of what the portfolio is doing currently? And would you be prepared to give us a trajectory through the back end of this year because obviously, we're -- I guess marking this issue [ph] with a bit of line of sight here.
G. Steven Farris: Yes, with respect to direction, we've got half a year and you've got 2 quarters of production. I think it's pretty easy to calculate what it's going to take to get to 6% to 9%. In terms of -- I'm sorry, I didn't catch your other question.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I'm just trying -- where is the portfolio right now, Steve?
G. Steven Farris: Well, we don't -- I've got to tell you it's higher. I will tell you, we don't give month-to-month production. I will tell you it is higher than what our average was, and we went -- each month went up. So July is higher than our average for the first -- the 3 months of the second quarter.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: All right. I won't push that one too much. So just one other one from me then. Egypt, it was -- production obviously was kind of flattish despite the decline in the oil price while realizations were -- seemed to have dropped off relative to your kind of historical capture, relative to Brent. Anything unusual going on there, and what should we expect going forward? I'll leave it at that.
Thomas P. Chambers: Douglas, that price -- adjustment of the price that you see in Egypt, which is lower than what you typically release -- the timings of the liftings, and it's more pronounced this quarter because of the volatility in the prices. We had a bigger drop in prices this quarter. But the key thing to note is there is no change in the underlying pricing of our oil in Egypt.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And the volumes, Tom?
Thomas P. Chambers: The volumes...
Rodney J. Eichler: We're -- on a gross basis, we had 13 days of production downtime at the Salam gas plant. That's 200 million a day downtime for 13 days, and the associated condensate production without that gas. That was probably the biggest impact for our overall volumes in the quarter.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, and I guess generally operationally, you're still pretty happy with how things are progressing there?
G. Steven Farris: No different. Everything is proceeding per normal operational program.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Michael Hall with Robert W. Baird.
Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I guess first on my end, just curious if you might elaborate a little bit on the comment you made regarding the potential interest in accelerating given the improving cost environment. Are there any particular areas that are more compelling? Just looking for maybe a little additional color there.
G. Steven Farris: Well, I'd say, obviously, and I don't think we're the only company in the industry that is experiencing it. We're seeing some significant reductions in frac cost, and we're also starting to see some softening in rig costs. Year-over-year, frac costs are down 25%. So we're beginning to see some impact of rigs coming out of other -- especially the gas areas and going to the more oily areas.
Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, appreciate that. And then I guess, as a follow-up on the downtime expected in Australia, can you quantify how long that's expected to be down?
G. Steven Farris: That will be at the end of September, but that's the ammonia plant going down or the fertilizer plant going down.
Rodney J. Eichler: It's about 3 weeks.
G. Steven Farris: 3 weeks.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Bob Brackett with Sanford Bernstein.
Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I had a question that follows on your pretty active lease round in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. What's your overall exploration strategy there, given you've such a deep inventory are you going to swing for the fence a little on the deepwater?
G. Steven Farris: Well, certainly, all of those blocks are exploration plays, and the good thing about the deepwater is you get the blocks for 10 years. So we're going to -- we're going to -- we plan on drilling 4 to 5 wells a year, and obviously, they're going to be the best projects that we can find. We do have a backlog of prospects, and we're -- the ones that are the best will come to that. But they're not small.
Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: But when you say best, is it -- are you going to keep high working interest? Are you going to go for highest risk volumes? Or are you going for things that are more likely to work?
G. Steven Farris: Well, honestly, it's going to be -- we're not going to have 100% of any well we drill in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater. That's a number one premise. Number two, we're going to balance the risk against the size. So some of them will be lower risk, but they're also going to be lower-sized. But in terms of -- we're going to run that program like we do the rest of the company, and that's going to be on a portfolio basis.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons.
Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: The FPSO, the Ningaloo Vision, seems like operations are running very smoothly. Is that vessel still supposed to have shipyard time next year, or is that maybe delayed?
Rodney J. Eichler: No, that's correct. It's still on schedule for shipyard time to do some modifications, and you're correct in your assessment about the uptime. In the transition period, we began actually operating the vessel with the contractors' ownership back in February, and subsequent to our involvement with the day-to-day operation, we experienced 95% uptime for the last 6 months. We're very pleased with the vessel's performance. Yet we still have to do the same kind of modifications that we intended to bring the Coniston and Van Gogh projects together in 2013.
Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: And then if you could compare your rates of return on the Gulf of Mexico shelf versus the Central region, it would seem like in the current NGL price environment and gas price environment that the shelf should be a better competitor for activity and for capital than it actually is.
G. Steven Farris: Well, it really has to do with balanced portfolio and risk and reward. Certainly, anything that has liquids with it in the Gulf of Mexico given the rate has a leg up on anything that you drill horizontal, frankly, just because of the profile. But in terms of risk versus reward, the predictability in shales is probably 99.9%. The question is what's the rate? So we try to balance both of those. And if you look at both of those programs, honestly, the Gulf of Mexico was always the highest rate of return projects we can do. I mean, we just got to find good ones to do.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of John Malone with Global Hunter Securities.
John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just a question on the Mississippian Lime, can you just give us some sense of how things are progressing there and what are the near-term steps?
G. Steven Farris: Well, we're going to drag in -- a rig in there, here next week, and we're going to drill our first Mississippian Lime horizontal well. And we've honestly -- if you're watching that play, there are some people that have had very good success up there, and we -- honestly I don't expect anything different than that. We have a good position, and it's a question of how long it will it take us to ramp it up.
John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division: So no notion on how many you'll drill this year?
G. Steven Farris: We're going to -- I'm sorry. We're going to drill 4 to 6 wells this year. Both there and also in the Bakken.
John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then second question in Argentina. Any comments you can make on this new legislation they're talking about, the submitting of budgets to the government for approval?
Rodney J. Eichler: We haven't -- other than what we've read in the press, we've interpret the preliminary decree information. We've not had meetings with the government yet. We're currently scheduled to have our first round of meetings with the government per that new decree by the end of September in which case we'll introduce our financial and investment plans for 2013. Now we've, in the past, we have annually produced an investment plan of similar format to the provincial governments. That's been standard procedure. This will be the first time having to do that as a requirement of the federal government. So yes, we don't know exactly what form it's going to take. We don't have the details from them yet on specifically what they want to have us prepare or disclose at the meeting. But that's coming up end of September, and they will have an answer for us within 60 days with regard to the nature of our investment plan and any comments they might have. That's our understanding of where it stands presently.
G. Steven Farris: Historically, we have -- and one of our philosophies down there is to spend our cash flow, and I think in terms of Argentina, that is what they're looking for because they have a number of companies down there, one of which has been in the news forever, and that is they didn't spend anywhere near their cash flow. And I think honestly that's what they're looking for -- who's not spending their Argentine cash flow in Argentina.
John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Just one quick follow-up on -- just on Egypt on the realizations asked previously. So can we see that those realizations climb back towards parity with Brent, just subject to liftings times?
G. Steven Farris: Yes.
Rodney J. Eichler: Yes.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Looking for an update on the Kitimat LNG process.
G. Steven Farris: Yes, Janine's here, Janine McArdle who's our Gas Monetization Vice President.
Janine J. McArdle: Yes, things are progressing on the Kitimat project. We are still working with our contractor to finalize speed. We're doing a few things to optimize both the design cost and schedule. We're continuing to work with the government on both provincial and federal on some final permitting that we would like to have before we make any decisions. And we're working with, again, multiple buyers in terms of a very long term, 20 to 25-year contracts, and that's going quite well.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, I guess you guys still expect to wrap something up by the end of the year?
Janine J. McArdle: So we'll be when we have all those things I just listed completed.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Got you. Okay. Just going over to Australia quickly. What's sort of the plans there on the exploration front for the rest of the year and next year? Because I haven't heard too much about that from you guys lately.
Rodney J. Eichler: We expect to maintain a 2-rig program pretty much throughout the next 18 to 24 months, drilling combination of exploratory wells, some development or exploitation wells, as well as the key development wells at Julimar-Brunello for the support of the Wheatstone LNG project, as well as the development drilling at our Coniston oil project that is tied to Van Gogh that goes with the Ningaloo Vision FPSO, that we just mentioned in a earlier question.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Got you, and it sounds like your rigs in North America, you've got like 62 of them. You're not drilling any gas. What gas price do you need to see before you start drilling some of the gas targets a little more?
G. Steven Farris: Higher than today.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: A question on the Tonkawa. You mentioned I think it's about a 10-well, it's at about 310 Mboe or 310 boe IP. I think at your Analyst Meeting, you had a number of wells you talked about and a type curve that was higher than that. And maybe it's apples and oranges, but I just wonder if you could put into context the rates that you're seeing now you talked about in the Tonkawa relative to your expectations.
G. Steven Farris: Well, I think it was over 400 barrels a day, as I recall Rod's comments. The other one is that's a 30-day average and that's actually that makes tremendous economics, and you've got a lot of mix of wells in there.
Rodney J. Eichler: At the Analyst Day, the type curve we showed for Tonkawa, we're expecting a typical well come on for about 300 [ph] barrels of oil per day. We've exceeded that typically by 10%. We're very pleased with the results of our 30-day average IP basis, and we have a significant inventory of Tonkawa location to be drilled right in the heart of play.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great, and then when you think about the CapEx required for some of the unconventional NGL transport options such as the rail one that you mentioned. Is that factored into your budget or is that kind of incremental spending to get the better realizations?
Rodney J. Eichler: That's part of our budget, and it is also part of the full cycle development economics for hitting the fields, which are involved.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Any update on Liard Basin? I know you talked about it at the Analyst Day, but is that well still holding up? And I think that was a well from last year. But is that well still holding up, and if so, what's the go-forward plan up there?
G. Steven Farris: Actually, that well is still holding up. We're drilling it -- we're drilling an additional well as we speak. And we're going to drill enough wells, 10-year [ph] wells, in order to hold all our acreage, the vast majority of our acreage.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, so we should just expect one rig running up there over the next year or so. Is that 6 to 12 months? Is that the right we think about it?
G. Steven Farris: Yes.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, moving down to some of the recent acquisitions. I don't -- as far as impairment charges go, is there -- was there any impact from NGLs in the Mid-Continent, like Cordillera acquisition or any other write-downs related to NGLs in the Mid-Continent?
G. Steven Farris: No. I'm not sure what you're alluding to but that's...
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Obviously, gas prices impacted impairment charges. I'm just trying to figure out what the impact of NGLs was as far as...
Thomas P. Chambers: The impairment charge was all Canada.
G. Steven Farris: All Canada, right.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. So nothing -- okay. So you have a cushion left in the U.S.?
G. Steven Farris: Yes.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Obviously some cushion, but how much cushion?
G. Steven Farris: Well, we have 30% of our production in the Central region is oil, and majority of that is black oil. So we're in pretty good shape there. I mean, you can never say never, but it depends on what happens to oil price there.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Yes. All right. And then the final question. I know you said gas prices have to be higher. Let me ask the question in a different way. Whatever number you have in the back of your head for gas prices, how long would they have to get to that level and stay there? Are you looking at a 12-month strip, like 24-month strip before you make the decision? I'm just trying to get the thought process as to when people start looking back toward gases. Do they have to stick there for 3 months or 6 months? Can you just talk a little bit about how you think about that?
G. Steven Farris: Well, number one, I think gas in this country -- most gas wells are going to be challenged and the reason is if you see prices increase, there are so many locations that people can drill gas wells. But what you're going to see is an influx of rigs and people drilling gas wells, and you're going to have -- you're going to run into the same problem. There are some things we could do right now to earn gas price, but we've got a limited amount of capital. And as Tom Chambers pointed out, price differential's about 30 to 1, and it doesn't take rocket scientist to figure out you'll drill an oil well if you got the opportunity. So that as much as what the actual gas price ought to be is really driving what everybody's doing. I mean it's your economics.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division: Actually going back to the Mississippian and the Williston plays. I heard --I got your point that you've got one rig running in each of those and you think you'll have 4 to 6 wells this year. Is there a time line you have in mind on when you will share your results in those plays? Is there like a certain number of wells you think you have to get down before you can come to a conclusion you want to share?
G. Steven Farris: Well, I think we've got to be satisfied with what the conclusion we reach on both of those. I would expect us to make some results known by the end of the year.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division: Got it. And what would a rig ramp -- a rig count ramp look like in those plays in the success case?
G. Steven Farris: Well, that is going to have to compete what we've got in the Central region and the Permian region. Certainly with our acreage position, we own a significant interest, 100%, most of the Bakken's stuff, and large interest in the stuff we have with the Mississippian Lime. So it gives us real opportunity to ramp that up if it works. And certainly, the Mississippian Lime is going to work. It's going to have to compete with capital in terms of rates of return with some of the other things we're doing. But Mississippian Lime is -- we're going to drill good wells. It's going to be whether or not -- what the economics are.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division: Got it. And one other kind of obvious question. Is there anything to add on the political situation in Egypt? I mean, it seems that it has been relatively news-free, at least by those standards, and so that seems welcome. But I wonder if you could add your impressions there?
G. Steven Farris: No, as Rod pointed out, we haven't -- we have continued to deal with the petroleum ministry, the Minister of Petroleum and since have continued to deal with the Chairman of the EGPC. I think Rod mentioned we have 7 new gas contracts that we've just signed. If anything, frankly, what we're seeing is, is that their need for hydrocarbons is such that it may have gotten a little bit better than has been the status quo just because of the urgency nature of bringing production on.
Rodney J. Eichler: There have been some significant political developments, for them, they announced a new Prime Minister. And he has subsequently appointed new cabinet as of yesterday, and I believe they took their oaths of office today. So we do have a new Petroleum Minister as of today, Osama Kamal, on the petroleum chemical -- petrochemical sector. So there may be some other changes associated with those ministerial changes.
Operator: I will now turn the conference back over to Patrick closing remarks.
Patrick Cassidy: Thank you, Regina. Thank you for participating in our second quarter conference call. The webcast replay will be archived on Apache's website. The conference call also will be available for delayed playback by telephone for 1 week beginning at approximately 4:00 p.m. Central Standard Time today. That ends our call this afternoon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Sarah, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Cassidy, you may begin your conference.
Patrick Cassidy: Thank you, Sarah. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Apache's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we reported earnings of $778 million or $2 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $1.2 billion or $3 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations totaled $2.6 billion for the quarter.  On today's call, we will have 3 speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. First, we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer; and finally, Tom Chambers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We prepared our quarterly supplemental data package for your use, which also includes a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or pretax margins. This data package can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financialdata. Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions, and no assurances can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
G. Steven Farris: Thanks, Patrick, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The first quarter of 2012 continued Apache's strong growth in production, earnings and cash flow. Our daily production during the quarter was up 7% from the first quarter last year adjusted for divestitures. And I want to point out that this growth came despite having about over 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day off during the quarter due to production disruptions, and Rod Eichler will get into more detail a little later in the presentation.  Our corporate production growth expectations for the year remains strong between 7% and 13% over 2011 with a capital program that, I might add, that lives within our cash flow. We are continuing to build production momentum, and I'd like to mention just a few of the highlights of the quarter before I turn it over to Rod who'll give you a more detailed operational report. In the Permian Basin, we entered the quarter with 26 rigs running. We now have 31 rigs running, going to 34. We have had good results in the Wolfcamp horizontal and the lower Cline plays, and we continue to accelerate as we get after a Permian drilling and resource portfolio that is really second to none.  In the Mid-Continent liquids play, we entered the first quarter with 6 rigs running and currently operate 22. We continue to have attractive and consistent results across a number of liquids plays from the Granite Wash, the Tonkawa, the Cleveland, the Marmaton, Cherokee and the Canyon Wash. Our drilling inventory in the Mid-Continent is very comparable to that in the Permian, and we are more than tripling our activity in order to translate that activity into production and cash flow today. Importantly, we have the asset strength to do this while still living within our cash flow in our Central region. We intend to unveil our Permian and Mid-Continent resource potential at our June 14 Analyst Day in Houston.  In Canada, we're quickly transitioning our activity into an oil and liquids play focus. In our drilling during the first quarter, we've concentrated almost entirely on the Viking, the Bluesky, Montney, Glacier, Chinook and Beaverhill Lake plays, which have real running room across 6 million acres in that region.  While this transformation unfolds, our current production in the region is still 83% gas, and our Canadian gas realizations continue to decline for the quarter, which contributed to a noncash write-down of the carrying value of our proved Canadian properties. And Tom Chambers will discuss this in greater detail in a few moments.  Oil and liquid plays, we are locking on our Canadian acreage, rival those in the Permian and the Mid-Continent, and the fact that gas prices are low is not unique to Canada. Our longer-term gas solution is exporting to BTUs where they are valued, and that's why we're pursuing the Kitimat LNG project, which continues to progress toward FID.  One change in our capital plans for the year in Argentina where our technical work has delineated about 650,000 acres in the oil window position in the Vaca Muerta shale. Most of it is either adjacent to or in the vicinity of the recent wells that have generated so much excitement down there, and our first test results have been very encouraging. And we have increased our region's capital program by 20% to accelerate our drilling and recompletion activity in this potentially very large oil resource play. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Rod Eichler.
Rodney J. Eichler: Thank you, Steve. We had another solid quarter of growth, and we're really just getting started.  I'll begin with international as the bulk of our new volumes in the quarter came from the North Sea, where we completed the acquisition of Mobil North Sea Limited's Beryl and other fields at the end of last year. Production is up 67% year-over-year and 41% sequentially with plans in motion for continued growth.  Apache assumed operatorship on December 31, including taking onboard 184 staff members from the previous organization to bring with them a wealth of experience and ideas for adding value. These fields had largely been in decline due in part to minimal investment from the prior operator who focused primarily on maintenance and compliance.  As we did at Forties, we expect to reverse the direction of the production curve by acquiring and processing new seismic data, drilling wells and continuing workovers and other value-adding activities. Overall, the general infrastructure and platforms are in good shape, although we're dealing with obsolescence in certain areas, which isn't unusual for mature offshore assets.  We recently drilled a new well from the Beryl Bravo platform, known as the BBP prospect, that we're currently completing and should have online later this month. Our team in Aberdeen is very excited about this one because we found virgin reservoir pressure in 2 of 3 zones containing more than 300 feet of net true vertical pay. This should be a very robust well and opens up further development opportunities.  A 1,500 square kilometer 3D seismic survey is scheduled to commence during the third quarter, and we expect this program will significantly supplement the backlog of drillable locations on these newly acquired assets. This will be the first 3D acquired over the Beryl area licenses since 1997, and we are expecting a step change in the ability to image and interpret the very large and geologically complex structures in this area.  Forties Field was off approximately 6,000 barrels a day during the quarter due to plant turnaround, ESP failures at 2 wells and the fact that no new wells came onstream to offset these disruptions. This is deferred production, and we expect to recover these volumes later this year. Also during the quarter, we completed our subsea development work at Bacchus. And the first horizontal development well commenced production last week, producing at an initial rate of 6,000 barrels of oil per day. A second well was spud and is drilling ahead for Jurassic objectives in the central and western parts of the Bacchus geologic structure.  In Egypt, overall, we're producing to plan. Our quarterly gross BOE volumes are up 1% sequentially. But under the terms of our production sharing contracts, as oil prices increased, our net production is reduced as fewer barrels are required for cost recovery. Due to these terms, our net daily production in the first quarter was reduced by approximately 4,000 barrels oil equivalent per day primarily from the 16% increased oil price realizations, averaging nearly $124 per barrel compared with $107 a barrel at the preceding period.  Operationally, we have more rigs running, 26 currently, than a year ago and more wells planned this year, 280 versus 262. Importantly, we're getting more development leases approved. So we're able to convert exploration success to production at a faster pace than last year.  And we continue to have good results with drill bit. In our Qarun joint venture, 2 exploration successes at the Heba field commenced production at a combined rate of 1,300 barrels of oil per day. In total, 22 new producers came online during the quarter, contributing 5,600 barrels of oil per day.  In our Khalda area concession, we made several significant discoveries. The Qasr-1X exploration well in the West Kalbasha Station [ph] tested at the daily rate of 5 billion cubic feet of gas per day and 4,800 barrels of 43-grade API of oil per day. In the Kronos field, the discovery well tested 22 million cubic feet of gas and 700 barrels of condensate per day on a 460-acre structure. At Karman [ph], a test of the lower Sapa yielded 1,100 barrels of oil per day. And in Khalda field, an exploration well proved up stack base in the lower Sapa and A and B sections testing 1,700 barrels of oil per day.  Lastly, exploration of the lower Baharia and Mirakar-1X [ph] in the AG development lease, which has been acquired from BP, it counted 198 feet of pay. After fracture stimulation, the well produced 28 million cubic feet of gas per day and 600 barrels of condensate per day.  We continue to progress the development of our assets in Egypt. Despite ongoing struggles in the quest for democracy, our operations have continued uninterrupted and are supported by our government partners, as evidenced by the issuance of new development leases, drilling permits and the ongoing process of the first [indiscernible] in 6 years. We're really optimistic for Apache's future in Egypt.  Turning to Australia. We commenced 2 new contract sales at our Devil Creek gas plant on January 1. New contracts significantly boosted our average gas price for our region, up 58% from the prior quarter to $4.18 per Mcf. Two cycles resulted in deferred production of 4,000 boe per day during the period, but there was no lasting damage. Van Gogh production averaged 10,800 barrels of oil per day, and we continue to realize good uptime and reservoir performance.  Pyrenees field average 14,400 barrels of oil per day in the quarter, below plan due to Cyclones Heidi and Iggy. Reindeer averaged 44 million cubic feet of gas per day for the quarter, and we have 2 additional Reindeer gas contracts coming on in 2013.  One of the highlights from our drilling campaign is the BHP Billiton-operated Tallaganda gas discovery in which Apache has a 25% working interest. This well accounted approximately 160 feet of net pay in the objective Mungaroo sandstones. We are currently evaluating the data and looking with our partners to determine the next steps.  At the Coniston oil development project, long lead items have been ordered, and subsea packages are being manufactured. Work is on schedule for start-up in the second half of 2013. The [indiscernible] development is also progressing with its first oil anticipated in the front half of 2014.  Finally, in Argentina, production was up from the prior year's first quarter but down from the preceding quarter due to higher gas reinjection and shale [indiscernible], which is typical during the southern hemisphere summer months of January through March. Our price realizations were up substantially from year ago. Approximately 84 million cubic feet of gas per day of our production was sold under the Gas Plus program at an average price of $4.95 per Mcf during the quarter.  Overall, our gas realization was up 37% to $2.98 per Mcf from a year ago. Oil realizations were also up, averaging $83 per barrel, a 38% increase. We've had no impact from the recent events involving the Argentine government and YPF. Our team in the country continues to have positive discussions with both federal and provincial authorities to identify and remove constraints toward developing new reserves and production.  We continue to focus our exploration and development activities in Neuquén Basin where we hold 1.7 million acres in the prospective Vaca Muerta shale per weight, of which 650,000 net acres are in the oil play. On the Huacalera block, we see the well last year as primary objective of the Vaca Muerta shale. The secondary objective is in the [indiscernible] formations.  We saw significant gas shales in all 3 formations, as well as El Contico [ph]. During the first quarter, we fracture-stimulated the well with testing beginning at the end of March. We will study those wells for the next couple of months to collect more vital data and determine steps for development. On the Quarta Vara block, a well we TD-ed last August to test the Vaca Muerta El Contico [ph] formations was also fracture-stimulated in the first quarter. We will soon place this well in a 90-day flow test before shutting it in to collect pressure data. We plan up to 8 rig completions in the Vaca Muerta formation this year with plans to permit up to 5 new drill locations, both vertical and horizontal, in the oil fairway. We expect to initiate this drilling in the third quarter.  Now moving on to North America. We continue to ramp up activity in the Permian, where we are the second-largest operator in the basin. First quarter production averaged nearly 99,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 70% of the production was liquids, and 82% of that was black oil. This is a 3% increase in per day production from the preceding quarter and includes about 2,800 barrels of oil per day related to prior period adjustments, mostly associated with BP and non-operated true-ups. We averaged 28 operated drill rigs for the period, up 3 from the fourth quarter, drilling 147 vertical wells and 17 horizontals. We currently operate 31 rigs in the region, including 6 horizontals.  We are running a 14-unit drilling program in the Deadwood area and continue to see positive results. In February, we commenced Phase 1 operations from the Deadwood gas plant, a joint venture with Crosstex Energy, immediately re-commit the facilities in the 90 million cubic feet of gas capacity. Phase 2 is expected come online this quarter and will be fully operational later this year. The plant capacity will be 50 million cubic feet of gas per day. We expect to drill third [ph] wells in Deadwood this year. Exploration drilling in the Cline Wolfcamp play is also underway. It's too soon to talk about results here right now, but we plan to provide more disclosure of our progress next month at our June 14 Investor Day. I'll move now to our Central region of Oklahoma and Texas Panhandle. We have more than doubled our position in the Anadarko Basin wash play fairway to nearly 550,000 net acres with the completion of the Cordillera acquisition on Monday. With it, we've increased Apache's exposure to the prolific Granite Wash, Tonkawa, Cleveland and Marmaton gas condensate oil plays. We now operate 22 drilling rigs in Anadarko Basin and are contracting for another 2.  A number of notable horizontal wells were completed during the first quarter. On Apache's legacy acreage, we drilled 3 Cleveland wells and averaged 400 barrels of oil per day and 850 Mcf of gas for the first month. Two Marmaton wells averaged 340 barrels of oil and 7.5 million cubic feet of gas per day and 3 Granite Wash wells, which averaged a daily rate of 475 barrels of oil and 5.6 million cubic feet of gas per day.  We also continued the successful Cherokee program, drilling and completing 2 wells that produced an average of 250 barrels of oil and 350 Mcf per day for the first month. On the newly acquired properties, 24 wells were drilled and completed during the quarter. Among them were the Cleveland well, which averaged 375 barrels of oil and 400 Mcf per day; 2 Tonkawa wells that averaged 475 barrels of oil and 1.1 million cubic feet of gas per day; and 5 Granite Wash wells that averaged daily rates of 240 barrels of oil and 8 million cubic feet of gas.  We also had a very impressive Marmaton well coming on with a 30-day rate of 11 million cubic feet of gas per day and 800 barrels of oil per day. Offsets to this well are currently being completed.  In April, net productions from the Cordillera assets averaged approximately 21,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 22% from January.  As with the Permian region, we will have more detailed disclosure of our Central region assets and opportunities on June 14. Sequentially, our lower first quarter daily production reflects our low fourth quarter rig count and asset divestments of approximately 40 million cubic feet of gas per day and 200 barrels of oil per day from our former East Texas properties. This will certainly be reversed in the second quarter with the addition of Cordillera and overall accelerated drilling program.  Turning now to the Gulf of Mexico shelf. We drilled 10 wells during the quarter with a 90% success rate. Our production for the region overall and for oil is ahead of plan of approximately 1,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 3,800 barrels of oil, respectively. Like other operators, we are dealing with third-party platform and pipeline issues, which offset higher volumes for property we acquired in 2010.  New pipelines are being laid in the Ship Shoal, South Marsh Island, Vermillion and Matagorda Island areas, which should help to address past pipelines shut-ins.  We are seeing some settling down in the regulatory environment. The Bureau of Safety and Economic and -- Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, or BSEE, is spreading the processing of drilling permits around other district offices, which is helping to alleviate the backlog built up since Macondo. I'm proud to point out that Apache was the first Gulf of Mexico operator to submit and receive Safety and Environmental Management System, or SEMS, audit plan approval. Implementation of that plan officially kicked off on Monday, April 30.  Notable activity during the quarter included the commissioning of a new platform of Main Pass 308. We drilled 3 wells, which, combined, are producing 900 barrels of oil and 5 million cubic feet of gas per day. A fourth well is drilled, and we're testing -- we're currently testing it, and we're prepared to drill ahead on a fifth. We anticipate drilling 8 wells total and reaching up to 3,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production by the end of this year.  Following a routine inspection, Apache detected corrosion at Grand Island 43 Complex [ph]. Approximately 5,500 barrels of oil per day and 11.5 million cubic feet of gas per day gross will be shut in while we undergo repairs, which are expected to take about 90 days. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we advanced the development on 3 subsea tiebacks, Wide Berth, Mandy and Bushwood.  Wide Berth came onstream last week, producing at gross daily rates of 35 million cubic feet of gas per day and the 3,200 barrels of condensate per day. We continue to clean up with 4 more [ph] expected in a couple of weeks and 50 million cubic feet of gas per day and 4,000 barrels of condensate per day. Development continues at Lucius with spar and topsides construction in progress, a successful appraisal well of Heidelberg extended the oil accumulation of approximately 1,500 acres.  A pre-FEED study has been commissioned to determine the development plans. We're currently participating in exploration test at Spartacus in the Lucius, Hadrian play fairway at Walker Ridge, Block 793. We're also waiting on the release of a rig and commence drilling of our Parmer prospect, a subsalt middle Miocene oil prospect that is expected to spud later this quarter.  In our Gulf Coast Onshore region, we drilled 7 wells during the quarter with a 100% success rate. This includes a horizontal well in Grindes County [ph] where we're testing Woodbine sands, a 16-stage frac simulation job over a 4,100-foot lateral is scheduled to commence this month. We also TD-ed our spar sale prospect at St. Mary Parish. This is a deep lower Miocene exploration test that we're scheduling for completion in the third quarter to coincide with upgrades under way to Atchafalaya Bay infrastructure.  In Canada, the transition to oil- and liquids-rich drilling is fully under way. Sequentially, quarterly oil production is up 5%, and gas volumes increased 22% -- gas liquid volumes increased 22%. We averaged 7 rigs during the quarter, drilling 58 wells with approximately 60% of these targeting oil reservoirs and 1/3 targeting rich gas. The remainder were service wells.  Among the region's highlights were the reactivation of Kaybob, a Duke well which tested 1,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day and is currently producing at 1,200 barrels of liquids per day and 2.6 million cubic feet of gas per day. This is the fifth-highest liquid-producing well in Western Canada and is Apache's highest liquid producer in the region. In our House Mountain focus area, a Beaverhill lake test, came in at 700 barrels per day. We also drilled 10 horizontal wells as part of our House Mountain waterflood project, completing the well's multistage asset fracs. Initial results are encouraging with IPs up to 1,100 barrels per day and 9 day rigs averaging 510 barrels per day during flowback. During the second quarter, the region is focusing on Midale and Brownfield oil drilling programs in Southern Alberta and Saskatchewan.  In summary, our momentum continues. We had several one-off production disruptions during the quarter, 6,000 barrels per day in the North Sea, 1,500 barrels in Central due to plant turnarounds and 4,000 barrels per day off in Australia due to cyclones. Otherwise, we could have reported more than 780,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.  Apache has a variety of opportunities across its diverse portfolio. In Onshore U.S. alone, we are ramping up our rig count from 32 in January to 52 today and to 60 by year end. Our accelerated activity will translate into visible future production and ultimately more value for our shareholders.  We have scheduled a 2012 Analyst Day for June 14 in Houston and plan to highlight our North American resource plays in greater detail.  That concludes the operational highlights, and I'll now be happy to turn it over to Tom Chambers.
Thomas P. Chambers: Thanks, Rod. Good afternoon, everyone. As you've seen by now, we reported earnings of just under $780 million and $2 per diluted share. These numbers tend to mask our underlying financial performance, which continues to provide a platform for long-term profitable growth across our region.  I'd like to emphasize what was mentioned previously both by Rod and Steve, in that we continue to grow our business, achieving record levels of production this quarter averaging 769,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Coupled with record oil prices, our revenues were the best ever at just under $4.5 billion for the quarter with oil revenues costing $3.5 billion, accounting for 79% of the total. More importantly, these factors resulted in continued strong cash flow with cash from operations before working capital items of $2.6 billion, up 18% from the prior year quarter and in line with last quarter. Our continued ability to generate significant amounts of cash flow from our asset base has enabled us to fund our robust E&D capital program across the globe. And getting after our capital program is critical in realizing the opportunities we have gained through our recent acquisition activity. We've been able to sustain this cash flow despite increasing pressure on North American gas prices, particularly in Canada. As in past quarters, our balanced portfolio has allowed us to benefit substantially from our oil position and the fact that oil currently sells for about 43x the price of North American natural gas. In addition, our international gas portfolio has also provided balance, helping to mitigate a 22% decline in North American natural gas prices from the year-ago period. First quarter 2012 international gas realizations were 17% higher than a year ago and 7% higher than the last quarter, driven by our new sales contracts in both Australia and Argentina.  Our acquisition of Mobil North Sea Limited at the end of last year also bolstered our international gas position by adding 65 million cubic feet a day at prices near $8. Our product mix with oil-related growth has helped preserve our financial strength despite significantly low natural gas prices here in North America. Natural gas prices are at levels not seen in over a decade and are straining many producers that are highly leveraged to this commodity. Our Canadian region is the most GAAP-leveraged region in our portfolio, and current period earnings reflect this. First quarter earnings were impacted by a $390 million noncash after-tax write-down for our Canadian oil and gas property balance.  Just to reiterate what most of you are familiar with, full cost accounting requires us to calculate the 10% discounted after-tax value of our proved reserves using period-end comps, a 12-month average for commodity prices in effect at the first day of the month. If the discounted value is less than our net book value in a given country, the excess is written off. Adjusting for this noncash write-off and foreign exchange impacts, earnings were $3 per share, up $0.10 from the prior year period and $0.06 sequentially. Higher cash margins of $47.94 per barrel of oil equivalent underpinned our healthy earnings and cash flow. Cash margins were up 9% and 6% versus the year-ago period and the sequential quarter. Our consistent focus on margins and cost trends continues to pay off. Total cash cost, excluding taxes other than income, averaged $13.19 of BOE, in line with our $13 to $13.50 target range for the year.  A detailed calculation of our margins, adjusted earnings and cash from operations can be found in the financial supplement located on the website.  Turning to the balance sheet. Our ability to consistently generate record cash flows has provided the opportunity for us to meet our planned capital expenditures and continue reaching into the acquisition market. In February of this year, we closed on the 49% share of Burrup Holdings ammonia fertilizer plant for $439 million, which allows us to realize additional price upside on one of our largest Australian gas contracts. And just this week, we closed on the $3.1 billion Cordillera Energy Partners acquisition in the liquids-rich fairway of the Anadarko Basin.  To fund these transactions and refinance some maturing notes, we successfully issued $3 billion of new debt in early April, 5-, 10- and long 30-year tranches at very attractive rates. Our balance sheet remains strong with almost $3 billion of available liquidity at the end of March and a debt to cap at only 21%. A key point I need to highlight for the first quarter is our effective tax rate of 49%. Higher than our typical 42% to 44% rate that you've seen. This rate was impacted by the Canadian adjustment mentioned earlier, as well as the higher taxed foreign earnings, contributing more of our overall net income during the quarter. Absent the Canadian adjustment, our effective tax rate would have been a more typical 43%. Similarly, these adjustments impacted our percentage of deferred taxes in the quarter. However, we would expect the deferred rate to move towards the 20% to 25% range for the year.  To wrap up, despite the lowest North American gas prices in a decade, Apache achieved its highest quarterly revenue ever. Our fundamentals are strong, and we continue to build a great deal of momentum with each passing quarter. With rising production, strong cash flow, a continued focus on delivering strong margin and an inventory of cost mix greater than any time in our history, we are poised to deliver continued growth and value for our shareholders.  And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Patrick.
Patrick Cassidy: We will now open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse.
Arun Jayaram - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Yes, I wanted to talk firstly, just trying to set the baseline where guidance is set on the production side. I know you had some asset sales late in the year that maybe impacted Q1 in terms of growth. But I just wanted to better understand what the baseline of the 7% to 13% growth is based on.
G. Steven Farris: It's the beginning of the year trend [ph] sale basically. So I think you heard it pretty much throughout the presentation.
Arun Jayaram - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. So we're basically just taking your 2011 growth, backing off the...
G. Steven Farris: About 11,000 barrels of oil, yes.
Arun Jayaram - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, okay. That's fair. And Steve, I just wanted to see if you could talk about your confidence perhaps in the middle part of the range. You are starting off a little bit of a lower starting point. Just give us a sense of your confidence to reach perhaps the middle point of that range.
G. Steven Farris: Well, let me put it this way. I feel very comfortable we're going to be ahead at the low end of that range.
Arun Jayaram - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And what do you think would you have to see to get to that middle part of the range in terms of your overall portfolio?
G. Steven Farris: Well, the results that we're going to have in the second quarter are going to be important, obviously. As you move out, the wells you drill in the first 2 quarters are really what sets the stage for your overall production growth. So I'm hopeful we show some added growth in the second quarter and certainly in the first part of the third quarter. We've got a very active drilling program going on right now, most active we've been in some time in North America.
Arun Jayaram - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Fair enough. One quick question in terms of Egypt. The gas price, I just wanted to get a little bit of color around the decline of the gas prices. I do know next year contractually, the gas price goes down just because of an expiration of a contract. But I just wondered if you can talk about that quarterly swing and the dips in gas prices.
Thomas P. Chambers: This quarter, we had an adjustment in the gas price. There was some gas that was booked at that old gas price that wasn't that. So you saw a reduction in the gas price to make up for that error last quarter. It was a onetime quarter deal.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: If I could try a quick follow-up on the Gulf question. Steve, when you say year-over-year, you've obviously had the Beryl acquisition and the Cordillera acquisition. So is the growth target organic growth target or total growth target?
G. Steven Farris: It's a total growth target.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. I just wanted to clarify that. Getting into the details a little bit, can we talk about the outlook for Australia this year? Because obviously, with Coniston scheduled to come onstream, I guess, in a year or so time, there's still I guess some debate over what you're going to do with the FPSO down there. So could you give us an idea as to what the expected downtime will be.
G. Steven Farris: Yes, Rod?
Rodney J. Eichler: Well, we have a combined Coniston, Ningaloo Vision, which is the name of the FPSO rectification project, which is sort of working both a subsea development in tandem with the repairs and modification. These are making them both. So the -- excuse me, [indiscernible] significant servicing work in early part of 2013. I forget the exact amount of days or weeks that it will be out of service before returning to the field later that year to be able to commence production for the combined Coniston and Van Gogh. I'm sure Patrick can get back with you with that number after the call.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. So the downtime is next year, not 2012?
Rodney J. Eichler: That's correct.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Second one for me, Steve, again, just I want to get back to you just again. Unfortunately, it still comes up as an issue, an overhang in terms of the uncertainty over there. One issue I wanted to get some clarity on is the risk of devaluation of the Egyptian currency. How does that affect your business? And I'll leave it at that.
G. Steven Farris: Well, Rod might wanted to jump in there too. In terms of -- we get paid in U.S. dollars. In fact, we export the biggest bulk of our crude production, and that's based on dollars. And the gas sales to Egypt you see are based on U.S. dollar equivalent. So we really shouldn't have any impact based on the dollar side other than maybe a little higher op costs just because they're paid in Egyptian pounds. Egyptian workers are paid in Egyptian pounds.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.
John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Focusing on sort of the weakness we've seen on NGL pricing, especially sort of in the Mid-Con region. I believe you've got like a pricing contract that's coming up pretty soon that's due on the technical side. Just sort of how you are thinking about it, maybe various options that you're considering to maybe address what's going on in the NGL pricing.
G. Steven Farris: Well, actually, there's an awful lot of work going on in the industry around that in terms of pipelines, and we're not excluded from that concept. And this is a little longer-term view of life. And it's quarter-to-quarter, but a little bit like we're facing in the Permian Basin. With the resource potential both in the Anadarko Basin and the Permian Basin, the easiest thing to pick is infrastructure, frankly. I mean, it's an industry we're facing that in the Permian, and it's -- those things are going to get built. It might be a quarter late, and everybody wants to project in their numbers. And I don't have any specifics associated with it. I'm just talking a little bit like Crosstex and our step there. In all truthfulness, I don't worry about infrastructure if the wells are good enough.
John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. If I just shift over to the Permian. Of the 31 rigs you got at the moment, you mentioned 6, right now, are focused on horizontal. I'm trying to get a sense of, around the end of the year, what you would envision that split looking like in terms of horizontal versus vertical.
G. Steven Farris: Well, it's an interesting situation in the Permian. Actually, it's unlike what's happening in the Anadarko Basin. We've got 22 rigs running in the Anadarko Basin. 21 of them are horizontal. In the Permian, that's a much lower number than the industry. In 2010, the number of horizontal wells in the Permian Basin was less than 10%. In 2011, it was a little bit more than that, which you're going to see in the Permian Basin. The same thing is happening in the Anadarko Basin, and the majority of them are going to be horizontal as we get into the future. Right now, I think we're projecting something like 700 wells, of which about 100 of them will be horizontal this year. A little over 100 of them will be horizontal.
Rodney J. Eichler: And that number is actually weighted heavily on the Deadwood side because over 300 of those wells that are in Deadwood this year, and those are almost all vertical wells, structural reservoir, targets deeper.
G. Steven Farris: And we've got a couple of Cline horizontal wells in there, and we will drill more of Cline horizontal wells in the future.
John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And just a final question for me. On New Zealand, I believe the first of the 4 wells that you all had planned there was going to spud during the second quarter. Is that still the case?
G. Steven Farris: Yes, it's either the second quarter or the first part of the third quarter. We just -- Rod and I just reviewed that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Baird.
Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just curious, as you kind of step back and kind of look at Canada and the opportunity there, kind of in unconventional liquids in particular, I guess how would you characterize that and its lifecycle relative to the U.S. And sorry if I missed it, but did you identify kind of how many, let's say, horizontal unconventional liquids targets you have up there this quarter?
G. Steven Farris: Well, the first question, I will tell you, it's in infancy. What some of the things we're doing on our acreage in the Provost in that area, actually, we've got a huge acreage position there that we're just now beginning to exploit. And that's shallow oil. That's 3,500 to 4,000 feet. And actually, we've had very good success there. Some of the other stuff that you -- the Cadomin and that kind of stuff over to the West, that's a little further along. In fact, what happens in Canada is it's late in coming. I mean, I'll be real honest with you. If you look what happened to gas prices. Everybody was a gas player in Canada until we saw what's happened over the last 18 months on gas prices. So we're not the only ones making that switch.
Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Sure. Okay. And then just on, the interruptions that we're seeing during the quarter, if I heard that right, I think about 10,000 barrels a day offline. Did those come fully back on in the second quarter?
G. Steven Farris: Well, the ESP work, part of it will be -- we had the turnaround at -- I think it's Bravo on Forties. The ESPs, we've got a rig that we're going to try to pull out there and do some recompletions and pull those pumps on the ESPs. Those may not all be done this year -- I mean, this quarter. But we also have a couple of other good things happening. That Beryl well that Rod mentioned is maybe the best well drilled in Beryl in the last 20 years. And I'd say that, we haven't gotten the test on it yet. So the best thing about it is we haven't tested it yet. It looks fantastic on the logs. I mean, it's virgin pressure. It could be the best well in the Beryl field in the last 20 years.
Roger B. Plank: This is Roger. Then there was 1,500 barrels a day in the Central region, which from a plant downtime, assuming another plant doesn't go down, that would be back online. And then typically, it isn't cyclone season.
Rodney J. Eichler: We're done with the cyclone season now. We're out of it as of this weekend.
Roger B. Plank: So that's 4,000 barrels a day. So most of it ought to be back online.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I have to ask, Egypt, can you just give us an update on anything since your last update as far as progress there and the new government and kind of where we stand on that?
G. Steven Farris: Yes, and then again, Rod probably has some comments, too. I will -- Rod and I were in Egypt about 1.5 months ago. I think what you...
Rodney J. Eichler: Because of the very large concession, because we have a sizable resource. Likewise, the 8 recompletions I referenced and the 5 new drills, those will be focused, for the first time our drilling will be focused in the oil window portion in areas that were very similar and adjacent to like VF and other companies' activities that have had press releases. And we're very encouraged by that outcome. They're on our core concession areas. We had some of our principal productions in the Neuquén Basin, and it's -- we'll have probably more to say about that on our June 14 meeting.
G. Steven Farris: Yes, I think it's safe to say we've gotten some cores. We've done some recompletions down in the oil window, which gives us very good encouragement to drill at least 5 or 6 horizontal wells in the Vaca Muerta shale oil.
Roger B. Plank: That shale is much shallower in those areas compared to the 2 concessions I referenced.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Excellent. Excellent, I appreciate that color, and very quickly on the North Sea, looks like you guys -- the activity's paying off there. How sustainable do you see the rates there for this year that we're seeing out of the North Sea for you?
G. Steven Farris: Well, I think it's early times. I will tell you, the Forties will, we will get that back, and that will be pretty steady. The good thing about the well that we just drilled is we really anticipate having more resource potential there than we thought we did going into it, frankly. I mean, in all honesty, this well found pay but it found much more pay than we thought it would. So it gives us added hope that, that resource potential there is bigger than what we had evaluated.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company.
Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Your U.S. gas volumes quarter-to-quarter down about 48 million a day. Is that because of the divestitures?
G. Steven Farris: Well, you bet. It was actually the divestitures were a little more than that. So that...
Thomas P. Chambers: 50-plus.
G. Steven Farris: I think it was almost 50 million a day. So you're looking at numbers that are comparable to last year.
Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: And Steve, have you seen your gas volumes start to level off in the U.S. or actually decline? Or are they still growing?
G. Steven Farris: Well, if you look at whether it's us or anybody else, when we talk about all of these liquid-rich plays, the Marmaton well that Rod mentioned is making over 800 barrels of oil a day. It's also making 10.5 million cubic feet of gas per day. And we've got 90% of that well. We've got a -- the Marmaton is going to be a good play. We've got -- it's not nearly as continuous as all those plays, but we've got, we've picked up a very big acreage provision from Cordillera in that play, and that's the second or third well drilled in the Marmaton, only second or third well drilled, so, so far, that's -- but you're going to see a lot of gas besides the liquid side of it.
Roger B. Plank: If I might comment, we've got 60 rigs running in America now, and 58 are targeting liquids-rich and oil. So to the extent -- we're a lot like everybody else, dry gas, we're just not drilling for. The other thing that might have gotten lost in the numbers is our gas production was up 3% sequentially. Well, it's because even though we're down in North America by about 40 million a day with the property sales, we're up 110 million abroad, which is, as Steve pointed out, we've got $4.02 during the quarter. It rose $0.27 from the prior quarter. Internationally, it's the first quarter where we're seeing our international prices higher than our North American prices. So our revenues are climbing internationally on the gas side.
Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Great point. Great point. And then just one follow-up. If you could provide an update on Kenya.
G. Steven Farris: Kenya should spud in the latter part of July. We've secured a rig. In fact, Rod and I reviewed that a couple of days ago. We should spud that well in the latter part of July.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Portillo with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Just 2 quick follow-up questions for me. Along the same vein on the U.S. gas production, could you provide any additional color on potentially how that could trend over the year if you're expecting kind of a steady increase or at some point, we'll see that leveling out? And then within Canada, as there has been historically a little bit more gas-focused, should we be thinking about those volumes declining and any potential risk on shut-ins?
G. Steven Farris: We just quickly looked at our outlook. I would suspect if our outlook is correct, our gas from the U.S. is pretty well flat, maybe a little up. In terms of -- what was -- the other one was about Canada? Yes, shutting in production is if it covers operating costs, there's no economic reality to it. And I don't anticipate us in any of our gas deals to get to the point where we shut in gas because the operating costs are higher than the price we're receiving.
Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Just to follow-up on that, I guess within Canada, and this might be an unfair assumption, but I'm assuming there's a little bit less liquids-rich drilling activity at the moment from you guys. Should we think directionally your Canadian volumes should start to decline at some point this year on the gas side?
Rodney J. Eichler: Well, you'd presume that, that would be the case with virtually no wells targeting dry gas up there. I wanted to clarify one thing on Steve's point. When he said flat, he's really, I think, thinking from this day forward with Cordillera built in because we're, of course, picking up quite a bit of gas there. So we ought to be able to have U.S. volumes flat to rising somewhat through the balance of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: On the LNG side, we've seen a number of LNG contracts signed for U.S. LNG here year-to-date. Can you give us an update on how you see the strength of the market, particularly the Asian market? And then given your advantageous geographic position at Kitimat to serve the Asian market, can you refresh us on what the key constraints are to an announcement on Kitimat? Is it the FID that gives you confidence in the greenfield costs or some other reason?
G. Steven Farris: Well, we -- and Rod again could do this a lot more in detail. But we are pretty much done with the FEED. I mean, I can't tell you enough that the real bottom line for Kitimat or any of these projects, what's happening in the U.S. is an anomaly. It's not a greenfield development. So what you're looking at, whether it's us or Shell, I read this morning that Imperial's thinking about getting in the business, all of those contracts are going to have to be oil-based contracts. And we truthfully are in the throes of negotiations for a very, very -- a tenant that could underpin that development. But we're not there until we're there. So we're continuing to negotiate. We're also continuing to declare right-of-way for the pipeline, and we're working towards the construction of the LNG facility. It's not a cost, as much as it is -- of course, they're, like anything, cost and price, are synonymous. I mean, it's -- but we haven't seen great increases on the cost side as we move through FEED.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And my follow-up is, can you just refresh us post-Cordillera acquisition, what we should expect to see your corporate CapEx run rate to be as we go through the rest of the year?
G. Steven Farris: Yes, we're going to stay within our cash flow. I don't know where our capital budget was for this first -- I mean, I know, but round numbers...
Thomas P. Chambers: 9.5 is what we said.
Rodney J. Eichler: Yes, and it's 9.5 to 10, honestly. We're going to have cash flow, usable cash or spendable cash around $10 billion for the year. And that's -- whatever we have is going to go on the ground.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. But no other changes beyond, I think, a slight point you made on Argentina?
G. Steven Farris: No, no, I mean, we're going -- we increased it $50 million to drill those Vaca Muerta shale wells. So it's not a huge bump.
Rodney J. Eichler: The way we look at that, you heard about the increases in the rig count in the Mid-Continent or Central region, Anadarko Basin, also in the Permian. And if cash flow holds up, then we'll just keep that many rigs or more running. And if cash -- if prices come down, then we might cut that back later. So that's kind of how we jigger it to live within cash flow.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Leon (sic) [Leo] Mariani with RBC.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just looking for a little bit more clarity there on Kitimat. Do you guys still think you'll make a decision to potentially build over the project by the middle of the year?
G. Steven Farris: I can't -- I don't think I can be more -- we're going to make a decision when we have all of the Is dotted and Ts crossed, and the most important I dotted and the T crossed is to have an MOU that is good enough in order to -- on the sales side, in order to take this project forward in an economic basis. And if that comes in the middle of the year, it will be middle of the year. If it comes in the third quarter, it will be in the third quarter.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: All right. Can you guys comment on the big onetime D&A expense this quarter?
Thomas P. Chambers: Again, Leo?
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: You had a big onetime D&A expense this quarter like $520 million. Can you...
Thomas P. Chambers: Yes, that was the Canadian write-off.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Got you...
Thomas P. Chambers: That was total in cash.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Got you. And can we get some more color on the discovery you made in Australia you talked about earlier?
Rodney J. Eichler: Well, Tallaganda is a project that's about 100 kilometers southwest of our DeSoto discovery from 2011. As I indicated in my remarks, it covers about 190, 160 feet per day [ph]. But the well is operated by BHP. We really have to defer our comments to the operator. Right now, we're evaluating the results of the well to see the forward path on future development. But we have to follow BHP's lead.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Got you. And do you think that's oil or gas?
Rodney J. Eichler: Well, I think I'd defer to the operator. I hope based on whatever press releases they've had out there, which is I don't think they've had much the way it's...
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Malone with Global Hunter Securities.
John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division: On Australia, it looks like CapEx was down a bit quarter-on-quarter. Is that just the general lumpiness of projects? [indiscernible] a trend there? And also on that, when do you start to see LNG spending really start to kick in?
G. Steven Farris: Well, yes, quarter-on-quarter, they may be just a little bit behind, but I fully expect them to achieve their targeted CapEx amount for the year. We've reviewed this on a monthly basis on our call just 2 days ago. As far as the LNG, we have some of the initial LNG-related. Some expenses are beginning late last year and throughout 2012. But the really big spike in those expenses will come in late 2013 and 2014 when the subsea is opened. It gets in place in fabrication and the central processing plant form and the gas plant begin in earnest.
John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just going over to Egypt for a second, I think you mentioned it before, but what was the gross production would have been without the PSE effects?
G. Steven Farris: Growth production was up 1% on a BOE basis, and our gas, oil prices were up 16%, which is basically on a PSE basis, we get less product in order to get the same cash back. So our oil was down about 4,500 barrels a day on a net basis. But it's -- on an overall gross uptick basis, it was up. So you'll see that turn around again next quarter.
Thomas P. Chambers: My simple way of describing that is if you got $100 of costs to recover and oil is selling at $100, then you've got 1 barrel. And if you have $50 oil, then you get 2 barrels. So when prices go up, it works the opposite of that.
John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just on Egypt, you were talking about the politics, just I know you can't extrapolate, as to what you think Egyptian politics are going to do, but how do you think it affects your gas prices if subsidies were eliminated or curtailed?
G. Steven Farris: Well, they've been talking about curtailing subsidies for at least a decade. I guess the good news in that is they actually made it a very transparent part of their budget about 7 or 8 years ago that we actually see the big elephant that is in the room. The subsidies or energy budget gas and oil refined products is probably going to run 115 billion Egyptian pounds in the coming budget year from what I read, which is significantly a lot lower than it was a few years ago, which is about 70 something-billion pounds, about $10 billion. I don't think that the subsidy issue is going to be resolved anytime soon. I mean, we may see some effects on the refined products like gasoline. But to give you an idea of just how extreme that subsidy is, 92 octane gasoline, I just read this morning, the subsidy sells at the equivalent price of $1.09 U.S. per gallon. The people who burn 92 octane are people with nice cars, not poor people or farmers with tractors and use lower octane fuels. So that's a pretty healthy subsidy for people who could afford to pay a regular price. I think the near term, what we're going to be faced with, at least for the next 5 years, I would expect to see the same contractual gas price on our gas sales agreements, which is tied $2.65 per million BTU. Unfortunately, we have very rich gas that we get more than that, $3 to $4 per Mcf basis, and oil price, of course we receive the world price based on our export volumes on the Brent market.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. Presenters, do you have any closing remarks?
Patrick Cassidy: Yes, Sarah, I do. Thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings call. I do want to acknowledge that we've been just made aware of some technical difficulties with the sound. So I want to apologize to those who were listening or will be listening to the playback. We will have the playback on our website within 1 hour. And thank you again for your participation.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Kendra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the 2011 Q4 and Year-End Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Patrick Cassidy. Sir, you may begin your conference.
Patrick Cassidy: Thank you, Kendra. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Apache Corp.'s Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we reported earnings of $4.5 billion or $11.47 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which excluded certain items that impacted comparability of results, totaled $4.7 billion or $11.83 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations totaled $10 billion.  On today's call, we will have 4 speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. First we will hear from Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tom Chambers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and finally Roger Plank, our President and Chief Corporate Officer.  We prepared our usual detailed supplemental data package for your use, which also includes a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or pretax margin. The data package can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financial data. Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions, and no assurances can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
G. Steven Farris: Thank you, Patrick, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Apache had an outstanding year in 2011. We had strong production growth, earnings and cash flow, all delivered with the financial and balance sheet discipline that has characterized our company for 57 years. Apache's global oil and gas production in 2011 was 748,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, which is 14% growth over 2010 and a new record for us. The strong growth delivery is consistent with our performance over time compared with other companies. Whether it's over the last 5 years or 10 years, Apache gross production posted more than most of its peers, and we do this in a balanced and diversified manner, living within our means.  Crude oil represented 45% of our 2011 production and if you add NGL, liquids represented 50% of our production. We already have the portfolio balance that most of our peers aspire to obtain at some point in the future. As we grow competitively, we do not sacrifice our balance. 2011 earnings, as Pat mentioned, was $4.5 billion, which was 50% up year-on-year or 36% per share. Our cash flow from operations before working capital items in 2011 stood at $10.2 billion, which was up 39% year-on-year. The driver of this financial performance is, truthfully saying, we focus on rate of return, and it shows. This financial performance will continue to fuel our growth as it continues to increase our investment capacity. Needless to say, 2011 was an excellent year for Apache.  I'd like now to move to 2012 and talk a little bit about our capital program and our production growth forecast. Our initial exploration and development capital budget for 2012 is $9.5 billion, which is a 25% increase year-on-year on a cash basis, and we'll continue to ramp up our activity in the Permian, the Anadarko wash fairways and development projects in deepwater Gulf of Mexico and also our global exploration. We live within our means, and we do it consistently. I would say at strip prices, this initial 2012 capital program leaves us with well over $1 billion of operating cash flow surplus. As we always do, we will put our additional investment firepower to use as we go through the year.  In the Permian alone, our initial budget increased from $1.1 billion in 2011, and I might add it was $500 million in 2010. In 2012, we'll spend $1.7 billion, and depending on commodity prices, we expect to at least double last year's price. We expect to grow production between 7% and 13% in 2012, which excludes operations divested in 2011. And we delivered this competitive growth with less than half of our capital. As Roger will outline in greater detail, over half of our 2012 capital program goes to projects to grow our production starting in 2013 and beyond.  In 2012, we're also stepping up our global exploration activity, and I'd like to briefly list a number of our key exploration steps for 2012. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we expect to participate in 6 oil prospects with a combined potential of well over 600 million barrels of oil equivalent, and we continue to grow our footprint and prospect pipeline there. In Alaska, we will grow our first wells in the Cook Inlet, which is a [indiscernible] oil exploration play, where we are the largest acreage holder with some over 800,000 acres. In the onshore North America, we're taking advantage of our premiere acreage positions to progress new liquids plays in which we have critical mass such as the Canyon Wash and the Texas Panhandle, where we were the first movers last year and are now shifting to the development phase with 14 wells in the play. A number of new plays in the Permian, including the Wolfcamp Shale play, where we're going to test our 25,000 acreage position there. Deepwater Kenya, we intend to drill our first major oil prospects in the third quarter for the potential of nearly 300 million barrels of oil equivalent and the opportunity to de-risk several additional prospects. In New Zealand, we expect to drill our first 4 wells targeting our new onshore unconventional play. We will also continue our exploration in Australia and Egypt, where we have built so much value through the exploration over the years, and we will continue to add new large-scale exploration positions, some of which we are not ready to announce.  We also started increasing our dividend in 2012, as you've noticed. Steady dividend growth has been an important element of our financial strategy over time. We put this on hold as the world went through its turmoil over recent years, but we believe it is the right time to resume our dividend growth.  Apache's mission is to build long-term value for our shareholders, and we remain confident that our fundamental value will be recognized. We're going to give some assistance from our portfolio evolution and more communication about our unbooked resource potential in the coming years. Over time, the market tends to recognize fundamental performance and in the long term, Apache share price has historically outperformed most of our peers, which is consistent with our leading growth and return delivery.  I'd like to point out that over the last 24 months we have increased our North American proved reserves by almost 50%, which includes our latest acquisition in the Anadarko Basin. Further, our 18 million acres in the heart of the Permian, the Anadarko Basin, Canada's resource plays in the Gulf of Mexico hold a premiere position of unbooked upside in most new plays across those areas. And it's time we gained recognition for our North American asset base, and we intend to communicate more on our resource upside during this year.  On the other hand, Egypt and the Gulf of Mexico shelf have caused concern over time based on the perceived overexposure for the company. Clearly, the events in Egypt have had an impact on our share price over the last year. However, in light of our enlarged portfolio, which includes our announced expansion in the Anadarko wash fairway, either of these regions now represent more than 10% of our proved reserves. Having said that, we remain bullish on both of them. We expect to continue to invest both in Egypt and Gulf of Mexico shelf for many years to come. The fact is with our enhanced portfolio balance, Apache continues to deliver strong growth without depending on any one region.  And with that, I'd like to turn it over to our COO, Rod Eichler.
Rodney J. Eichler: Thanks, Steve. I'll focus my remarks on our 2012 plans based on the initial allocation of capital and what this means in terms of production for each of our regions. The biggest drivers for our growth in exploration in the year ahead include the following: the Permian and Anadarko basins, where we are going to step up our activity by close to $1 billion; the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, where we are broadening our participation in high-impact prospects such as appraisal drilling at Heidelberg and moving into the development of megaprojects such as at Lucius, where our first test well last year flowed at 15,000 barrels of oil per day, a rate that was constrained by a surface test equipment.  In Australia, we've entered full development at Wheatstone LNG, Apache's first LNG project. In our global exploration, our efforts over recent years are now translating to big steps forward across a number of new portfolio positions. During the year ahead, we expect to run between 90 and 95 operated rigs worldwide on a daily basis. This is up from the 80 rigs we averaged during 2011. We are planning up to a 30% increase in new wells drilled, which represents approximately 300 additional wells compared to the 1,100 wells drilled last year. More than half of all planned wells will be drilled in the Permian and Anadarko basins as we exploit their liquid-rich stacked pay opportunities. Across our portfolio, a shift is underway to Apache to direct our drilling to more profitable oil and NGL opportunities. This will be most evident in North America. Our supplemental disclosure document posted on our website outlines Apache's 2012 capital by region. It can be found on Page 10.  I'll move on now to discussing our recent highlights. We continue to ramp up activity in the Permian, where we have been active since 1991 and are now the second-largest player in the basin. The increase and acceleration of activity in this region has been steep. Until 2009, the area was managed from our Tulsa office. We opened our Midland office in 2010 with a half dozen employees operating 5 rigs executing a $500 million capital program. Last year, we spent about $1.1 billion and increased the rig count to 25. Today, we have more than 200 employees in our regional office, with 480 field staff. We operate 30 drilling rigs and more than twice that many pulling units and plan to spend $1.7 billion in the region during 2012 as we continue the steady ramp-up of our drilling program. We plan to drill more than 600 wells in the Permian this year and expect mid-single-digit production growth in 2012, and the true contribution of this investment will be realized in 2013. We expect to increase our pace of activity overall in the Permian throughout the year.  The Wolfcamp play in the Deadwood area will continue to represent about half of our Permian activity in 2012. In the past year, we've cut drilling time in half, further enhancing the already attractive economics of this play. During 2012, we're going to be active in just about every play and area of the Permian basin.  I'd like to talk briefly about a couple of our catalysts in the region. In November, I mentioned the first 2 horizontal wells Apache drilled in lower Cline. We've now drilled 4 lower-Cline horizontal wells at various locations across our 100,000-acre Deadwood leasehold. These wells are contributing -- 3 wells are producing in this 5,500-foot lateral, and a fourth is being prepared for fracture stimulation. Results from the last 2 wells indicate initial production rates of 300 barrels of oil per day and 200 Mcf of gas per day, with expected EURs of 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per well. Based on this early success, there are potentially an additional 565 resource locations on our current leases. We anticipate drilling up to 4 lower-Cline horizontals in 2012 and testing 2 additional shales in the Atoka, Barnett and the Wolfcamp formations on this acreage.  In the Southern Midland Basin, we leased 20,000 acres in the Wolfcamp shale play in Irion County, which brings our total to 25,000 acres. This is in addition to 31,000 acres in the form of BP leasehold we have in the same area. And during 2012, we plan to drill up to 6 horizontal wells on these properties. We currently think there's potential for up to 150 locations, horizontal wells in this area.  Apache has built a 30,000-acre position in the Bone Spring and Wolfbone plays in the Delaware basin. We currently estimate up to 130 horizontal locations and 160 vertical locations on our position. In 2012, we plan to drill 2 or 3 wells at both the Bone Spring and Wolfbone plays in Loving and Pecos County, Texas. We're still determining the size, but each of these opportunities has the potential resource of drilling backlog for extensive, long-life development. As we drill more wells and collect more data this year, we'll be able to disclose more about our Permian plays. We plan to conduct a detailed review of our Permian resource potential at our Analyst Day in midyear.  I'll move on now to the central region of Oklahoma to Texas Panhandle. We will more than double our position at the Anadarko wash play fairway to more than 1 million acres or 487,000 net acres through the Cordillera acquisition announced last month. Together, Apache and Cordillera are currently running 17 rigs in the region and will assume operatorship of Cordillera's rigs when the deal closes, which is expected in the second quarter. By closing, we expect to have up to 25 rigs operating on the combined properties. We plan to drill up to 160 wells in the Cordillera acreage alone, principally in the liquids-rich Granite Wash and the Tonkawa and Cleveland oil plays. As a result, in 2012 we expect to increase our annual production from this region by nearly 50% on our continuing operations. This excludes East Texas, which has been divested and represents about 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2011.  As announced in the news release this morning, we also added 96,000 acres to our position in the Bivins Ranch area. Our initial exploratory results in the emerging Wittenburg Basin play had been very encouraging, with 3D 30-day production ranging from 107 barrels of oil and 42 Mcf of natural gas per day to more than 1,000 barrels of oil and 800 Mcf of gas per day. We completed a 240 square mile 3D shoot on the property during 2011, which we're using to further de-risk in the 5 future drilling locations. Our breadth and scale across these plays allows us to generate efficiencies to increase the value of our position. In the Granite Wash alone, we've been able to reduce costs $500,000 per well by optimizing our casing design, reducing pump volumes and changing profit type. Across the region, we've implemented a fracture database to allow us to reduce frac size and reduce costs by more than 25%. We will continue to pursue these kinds of improvements as we simulate Cordillera assets into Apache.  The Gulf of Mexico shale continued to fuel our investment firepower with strong free cash flow generation and attractive returns. We manage the shale as a financial investment, perhaps the best one we've ever made and that is a growth region. Production there is expected to decline in the high-single-digit range during 2012 as we have channeled most of its cash flow to growth areas in our portfolio. However, we will increase our activity in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in 2012.  On the development front, we approved the Lucius development project in December, and its first oil date is scheduled in 2014. Heidelberg, another potential 200 million barrel oil development is currently drilling an appraisal well in Green Canyon Block 903. In the year ahead, we expect to commence production from the Bushwood, Mandy and Wide Berth subsea tieback developments, increasing our production for this region by close to 15%.  We also have a mix of prospect types that we'll test this year, including sub-salt and salt overhang targets, where new seismic techniques, particularly one asset's data acquisition and processing, are improving our ability to manage areas that have historically been difficult to manage and interpret. We plan to drill and participate in up to 9 wells in 2012, including appraisals at Lucius and Heidelberg. This also includes 6 exploration prospects with more than 600 million barrels of potential resource and where Apache's working interest average is 35%.  In our Gulf Coast onshore region, we grew our acreage position significantly last year. Rates of return in this traditional hydrocarbon-rich area are robust, and our willingness to seek opportunities away from the herd puts us in a position to have a double-digit production growth in this region in 2012. We expect to run 3 rigs and drill more than 30 wells, nearly all of them targeting oil reservoirs.  Turning to Canada, Apache holds approximately 7.5 million gross acres in Western Canada. And while the region was generally thought as a gas province, we have a substantial multiyear inventory of oil and liquids-rich opportunities, as well as dry gas. 3/4 of Apache's 170 wells planned for Canada in 2012 are currently oil- or liquids-rich reservoirs. We plan to average a 5-rig program for the year, growing production by more than 5%. 80% of our activity will be focused on oil plays, the Glacier, Viking and EOR oil plays, and the Bluesky liquids-rich gas play. We progressed the Glacier oil play to the development stage during the fourth quarter, with 3 horizontal wells tested at an initial rate of approximately 80 barrels of oil per day. We currently hold approximately 162,000 net acres in this shallow drilling play. This success sets up a 37-well program for this year, with EURs ranging from 80,000 to 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent per well. We continue to expand the fairways of these plays in our portfolio as we also test additional oil and liquid plays. Our transition in Canada is well underway, but the step change will come with the Kitimat LNG project. LNG gas sale negotiations continue to move forward, as do all development preparation elements of the project. We will announce further developments at the appropriate time as we progress towards final investment decision. Apache's first mover steps to secure a development-ready integrated LNG project at a very low cost continues to look better and better for our shareholders.  In Australia, we're going to double our investment in 2012 as we move into the heart of the construction phase with a number of major projects. It will provide Apache with growth for many years. The largest component of our investment in the Wheatstone LNG project, which will provide us with a multi-decade visible free cash flow profile that is oil-linked, provides a steady plateau profile year after year and, in fact, has growth potential via expansion phases. Because of the long lead times out of our developments and the timing when all of these projects come online, the production profile of Australia can be lumpy. We expect this region's production to decline in the high single digits for 2012, which is absorbed by the rest of our portfolio as this exploration-driven region continues to develop projects that drive Apache's future growth trajectory. Australia exploration will be active in 2012 on multiple fronts. Most important would be our de-risking of resources to potentially support additional LNG trains and premium-priced domestic gas projects. This includes appraisal of the Zola area, a 2011 gas discovery on trend with the multi-Tcf Gorgon Field and the BHP-operated [indiscernible] exploration prospect.  In our Egypt region, 2011 was a year of production growth, with net oil production up 5%. One of the more active and successful drilling areas in Egypt last year were the development leases acquired for BP. Since November 2010, we've drilled 31 wells in our exploration program as a result of the 3 new field discoveries and 2 new field extensions. Oil production here has increased 60% to 34,000 barrels of oil per day, and gas production is 140% higher at nearly 90 million cubic feet gas per day. One exploration well of note is the Spyglass 1x on the AG development lease that tested at a daily rate of 21 million cubic feet gas per day and more than 400 barrels of oil per day for the lower Bahariya formation.  In 2012, we plan to maintain our 2011 level of investment and growth in Egypt, running 25 rigs and drilling more than 250 wells. Up to 70 of these wells will be exploration test. We are advancing important new exploration plays across our 11 million gross acres in Egypt. These new plays include stratographic traps, the deeper horizons in the Paleozoic and unconventional resources. Like the Permian and Anadarko basins, the Western Desert provides multiple stacked pay opportunities. Each one of these plays has the potential to give our asset base in Egypt entire new decades of life cycle beyond the current successes.  In the North Sea, we closed the ExxonMobil transaction at the end of the fourth quarter, which gives us a greatly expanded asset base and talent pool going into 2012. We expect to run 6 rigs during 2012 and build 33 wells. The Forties Field, previously our sole asset in the region, represents half of our drilling capital in 2012 as we increase our opportunity set with new wells at Beryl, Bacchus and an active exploration program. These important steps will propel our North Sea production to a 60% increase or more in 2012.  The foundation for continued growth in 2013 will also be strengthened during this year as we install additional platform in 40s and acquire the first field-wide 3D seismic survey over Beryl in 15 years.  Finally in Argentina, we maintain our financial discipline by living within our cash flow as we advance the appraisal of what is believed to be one of the largest shale resource basins of any country outside the United States, and Apache is the leading North American company in the shale fairway. Most importantly, Argentina in 2012, we plan to conduct the first oil test in our shale play position. Our acreage is adjacent to the recent wells drilled by YPF at Loma La Lata. Development drilling in areas tied to premium-priced gas plus contracts is expected to drive our Argentina production growth above 5% in 2012.  That concludes the operational highlights, and I'll now turn it over to Tom Chambers.
Thomas P. Chambers: Thanks, Rod, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to reiterate what Steve mentioned earlier in that we had record results for the year across the board. Underpinning our 2011 financial results was record production, which averaged 748,000 barrels of oil a day, up 14% from the prior year. More importantly, we achieved record oil production of 340,000 barrels per day, allowing us to benefit from higher oil price realizations. For the year, we reported record earnings of $4.5 billion or $11.47 per diluted share, our first time to break the $10 threshold. When we remove items for comparability purposes, adjusted earnings were $11.83 per share, up 32% from the prior-year period. Record production and oil prices drove cash from operations before working capital items, up 39% to $10.2 billion, our best year ever.  In a nutshell, it was a phenomenal year in all respects. Record cash flow enabled us to fund our largest E&D capital budget, acquired assets for another $2 billion in cash, which provide a future platform for continued long-term profitable growth, while we also paid down $925 million in debt. So we were able to end the year and reduce our debt-to-cap 20%.  I want to highlight the importance of our portfolio's ability to consistently generate cash flow. For 2011, our $10 billion of operating cash flow enabled us to achieve many targeted goals and set the stage for continued growth into 2012. Without the constraint of having to pay down debt in 2012, the 2012 capital budget spending rises, as Steve indicated. However, I would emphasize that our disciplined approach reduced capital on a quarterly basis to ensure we do not outspend our cash flow or, if prices rise significantly, to potentially allocate any excess to the best projects available. These results speak volumes for our balanced portfolio strategy given the significant volatility seen in commodities. We've been able to benefit substantially from our oil portfolio and the fact that oil currently sells for over 40x the price of North American gas. Our oil balance also offers us a unique benefit when it comes to price. Dated Brent and sweet crude from the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf Coast onshore areas continue to be priced at a significant premium to WTI-based prices. Approximately 75% of our total production receives Brent index or Brent comparable index pricing, realizing premiums of $10 to $15 a barrel to WTI. Our North American gas prices remain depressed. Our international portfolio is providing access to rising gas prices, particularly in Argentina and Australia, as you heard Rod just mention. Compared to the prior year, our international gas price realizations were up 27%. Higher realizations and a steady commitment to holding a line on costs allowed us to report solid cash margins of $45.60 per boe, up 30% over 2010 levels. Pretax margins, which includes DD&A, increased 37% to $29.64 per barrel of oil equivalent. These closely watched measures, combined with our focus on returns, drove our return on average capital employed to over 13% for 2011. We are very focused on margins and continue to monitor cost trends. Total cash costs during the year averaged $16.24 per boe, up $0.86 over last year. As with each year, our goal is to keep 2011 cash costs flat with the previous year. We ended up slightly at 6% higher, influenced by the impact of rising oil prices on cost and continued market pressures in nearly all of our regions. Absent taxes other than income, which are basically production taxes linked to prices, we are focused on keeping 2012 cash costs in the range of $13 to $13.50 per boe for the full year average. Our recurring DD&A was also up in 2011 from prior-year levels, as you might expect with our recent acquisition activity. Through our drilling program, we added more -- we more than replaced current production by adding 342 million barrels of oil equivalent to proved reserves during 2011. That's about 125% of what we've produced during the year. Including acquisitions, sales and revisions, we replaced 113% of production. We believe our exceptional cash flow provides a critical foundation as we head into 2012. With the confidence of continued strong future growth prospects and financial position, our Board of Directors, at their last meeting, increased the regular quarterly cash dividend 13% to $0.17 per share, as Steve already indicated. The board also indicated they will continue to review the dividend level annually as our progress -- as we progress further.  To wrap up, we had a record year, one that provided our best financial results in the company's history, one that is ended with a considerable amount of momentum and one that sets the stage for continued growth and opportunity into 2012.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger.
Roger B. Plank: Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. 2011 was, indeed, another year of growth and change for Apache, and I wanted to just take a moment to reflect on how the company's evolved over the last few years. In a deteriorating price environment for North American natural gas, in the last 2 years Apache turned $7.5 billion in cash flow to $17.5 billion. Through drilling and acquisitions, we've invested $25 million, expanding our production and rebalancing our portfolio in areas with considerable future growth prospects. To manage this change and maintain focus on executing and delivering consistent profitable growth, we've added hundreds of professionals and, importantly, 3 new growth regions: deepwater, Gulf Coast onshore and the Permian Basin. In addition, recent changes in our central region, including the Cordillera transaction, will transform its legacy Apache region into one of our most active drilling regions focused on drilling oil and liquids production.  The changes have the affect of beefing up our portfolio in North America and today, onshore North America represents 38% of our worldwide production compared to 28% just 2 years ago. On a pro forma basis, including Cordillera, no single region accounts for more than 1/5 of our total production. Although our geographic mix has shifted, our production mix has not. Half our production remains liquids, in which 90% is oil. Another aspect of Apache's portfolio evolution is the inclusion of a growing number of long lead times, impactful development and infrastructure projects. More than half of our 2012 capital goes to projects that contribute no production this year, but will contribute meaningful volumes in 2013 and beyond. In fact, following additional investment, we expect these projects will add hundreds of thousands of equivalent barrels to our daily production spread out over the next 5 years.  Fortunately, we have the portfolio diversity and financial strength to make these significant long-term investments while still delivering near-term profitable growth. We've also evolved our approach to global exploration. We've established meaningful position through joint venture agreements and acreage acquisitions in frontier areas mentioned earlier, Cook Inlet in Alaska, New Zealand and offshore Kenya. Each of these positions target oil and we believe hold hundreds of millions of barrels of resource potential. While unproven at present, we believe it's just a matter of time before our exploration strategy gains legs and begins to pay off.  At the end of the day, we aren't too concerned whether our production comes through acquisition of drillbit, but we do recognize the potential value of internally generated prospect development and active exploration. Apache's changes come amid a rapidly changing industry and world. The lowest North American natural gas prices in a decade are squeezing industry cash flows and capital investment. After visiting double-digit natural gas prices, the industry is finally reaching a point of capitulation where companies are beginning to pull on their horns due to lack of funding. This process has a cleansing effect. With industry laying down gas rigs, the upward pressure on cost for drilling, completions and other services is beginning to subside. Lower cash flow and capital in the hands of the competition will also lead to more attractive opportunities to drill and acquire. Frankly, it makes for an ideal environment for well-heeled companies with strong cash flows, such as Apache, to excel.  In closing, following a year of record financial results driven by our 31st year of production growth out of the last 33, Apache has all the ingredients to deliver standout results again in 2012.  Patrick?
Patrick Cassidy: That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Two questions. First on the Cline shale, how does the Cline compete with other horizontal and vertical opportunities that you're pursuing in the Permian Basin? And can you talk to what your well cost expectations are there relative to the EURs that you mentioned earlier?
G. Steven Farris: Well honestly, Brian, I think it's a little early to tell how they can be. But with our portfolio, we are going to test most of the plays and the horizontal plays out there, whether it be the Wolfcamp shale or the Cline. And frankly, we're looking for the highest rate of return. I think Rod mentioned 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with a cost of what, Rod?
Rodney J. Eichler: Completed well cost around $6.5 million.
G. Steven Farris: Yes, completed well cost $6.5 million, so it will compete with most shale plays.
Operator: And your next question is from Pearce Hammond of Simmons & Company.
Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: You outlined your production growth for this year at 7% to 13%, and you made some smart acquisitions in the course of the last year, the North Sea acquisition and here recently, Cordillera. If we try to look at just the organic production growth rate without the acquisitions, what do you think it might break out to be?
G. Steven Farris: Well honestly, we don't break that out. I will tell you probably in the high single digits.
Operator: Your next question is from John Herrlin of Societe Generale.
John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: Two quick ones. In terms of your CapEx budget, how much is actually exploration and how much is development, because you just depict it as E&D.
G. Steven Farris: Well, whether it's in the regions or new ventures group, it's about $1 billion.
John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: Okay, that's fine. Next one for me is on Egypt, Steve. Your reserves went down out a little bit year-over-year. Were there performance issues because you had negative revisions? Normally, you have positive revisions there. And that's it for me.
G. Steven Farris: Actually, what we had is we had a negative revision, but it all has to do with price. John, you're aware of that concession agreement. What happens is you get more barrels for cost recovery, but you also have an adjustment on the reserve side. So that's counterintuitive. I mean, when you have more production, you have less reserves. And if you have less production, you have more reserves. I mean, it really is the way the concession agreement works.
Roger B. Plank: So because we got to recover our costs, the higher the price per barrel, the lower the reserves you get to report. But the actual reserves performance has been just fine.
Operator: And your next question is from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research.
Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: One of your competitors has talked about a JV or a sale of kind of 1 million acres scale asset in the Permian Basin. What's your appetite for that sort of scale transaction?
G. Steven Farris: Well, we don't really comment on that, number one. And the other one is I think we have a pretty good acreage position as it is. Actually we are never looking, but opportunities come in a lot of different ways.
Operator: Your next question is from Leo Mariani from RBC.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just kind of 2 quick questions here for you. I guess first off, could you maybe elaborate a little bit on your progress there on Kitimat? You guys kind of advanced negotiations with potential buyers. And a quick question here on the Permian. Obviously, you're stepping up the capital pretty dramatically here in 2012. And if I heard you guys right, you talked about mid-single-digit production growth in the Permian in '12. It just seemed like a low number to me. Is there some infrastructure issues there? Or maybe I misheard you guys.
G. Steven Farris: Yes, I'd answer the first one at Kitimat. Frankly, we're somewhat past the polite introductions and that kind of stuff with respect to buyers. We are now in throes of actual negotiations. And in terms of the Permian Basin, you understand we're the second or third largest producer out there, so you've got 93,000, 94,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day starting off with. So a higher single-digit growth is a pretty good number, especially with the kind of capital that we're putting in there.
Rodney J. Eichler: There's also a lot of timing involved. We have a lot of wells that are being drilled throughout the year. All those wells probably won't make it out to production until the early parts of 2013.
Operator: Your next question is from John Malone of Global Hunter Securities.
John Malone - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just on Argentina, can you guys give us any color on the [indiscernible] well? The indication so far is gas. Have you seen any liquids in that? And really just overall, can you give us some thoughts on trends, what you're seeing in Argentina in terms of export and patriation, the politics down there?
Rodney J. Eichler: Well, the exploration test we drilled at [indiscernible] in 2011 was specifically targeting the shales in the gas window. So it was a gas -- designed to be a gas test. That's what we have been evaluating. The subsequent wells we'll be drilling in 2012, as I mentioned, will be oil tests that are in the shale oil window as we currently mapped them adjacent to the recent discoveries announced by their operators.
G. Steven Farris: With respect to your question about the politics down there, I think it's well to take a look at the circumstances that YPF, Repsol and the government of Argentina are in. I don't think there's any question that the Argentine government would like more money spent by YPF or Repsol in country. Personally, I think what you're seeing is a lot of discussion that really revolves around a specific issue. So we're truthfully not concerned about the wholesale expropriation of the oil industry down there.
Rodney J. Eichler: In fact, Apache has been held up by the government in their recent press releases as one of several companies and an example of increasing the production and meeting or exceeding their production targets outlined in their concession agreements.
Operator: And your next question is from Mario from Tuohy Brothers.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: It's actually Craig Shere. Mario had to jump off, but we have a quick question as a follow-up on Argentine also. Can you remind us how large the acreage positions are and the gas fee and then the oil shale windows and if you're still looking to expand acreage in either of those? And remind us the details regarding the 2012 drilling effort in the oil shale.
Rodney J. Eichler: Okay. So the first part of your question, we have about 1.7 million gross acres, about 900,000 net acres in the shale fairway. We do not break that out; I don't have a breakout of that by oil province or gas province in that fashion. So it's a simple part of the Neuquén Basin. The second part of your question was what was...
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Capital.
Rodney J. Eichler: Capital in 2011?
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: 2012.
Rodney J. Eichler: 2012. All right, 2012. We're looking at about $250 million as a preliminary capital allocation for our Argentina projects.
G. Steven Farris: Just so you know, that's not an opportunity number. That is more of a prudency with respect to staying within our cash flow down there. And we're really testing ideas. If you look at any of our areas, when we talk -- Brian asked a question about the Permian Basin. We have built meaningful acreage positions in some of the best hydrocarbon basins in the world. And what we are trying to do is build long-term value for our shareholders. So in the Permian, we're going to test a number of different shales in a number of different ways, horizontal, and the same we're doing in the Neuquén. And we are a legacy owner in the Anadarko Basin. So it's not surprising that new technology catches up with a lot of hydrocarbons.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time.
Patrick Cassidy: Okay, thank you, Kendra, for those remarks, and thank you for participating in Apache's conference call this afternoon. A webcast replay will be available on our website after 4:00 this afternoon.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Apache Corporation's Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded. Today's presentation will be hosted by Mr. Patrick Cassidy, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Cassidy, please go ahead.
Unknown Executive: Thank you, David. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Apache Corporation's third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. This morning, before the market opened, we reported third quarter 2011 net income of $983 million or $2.50 per diluted share. As disclosed in the release, Apache's adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items that impact the comparability of results, total $1.2 billion or $2.95 per diluted share. Cash flows from operation totaled $2.7 billion. On today's call, we will have 4 speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer; Roger Plank, President and Chief Corporate Officer; and Tom Chambers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We have prepared our usual detailed supplemental data package for your use, which includes a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we used, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or costs incurred. The data package can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financialdata. Today's discussions may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions, and no assurances can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.
G. Steven Farris: [Audio Gap]  And development plays around the world during the quarter. [Technical Difficulty]
G. Steven Farris: And I don't think I have to say good afternoon, but good afternoon, everyone. Again. We had a great quarter and as I mentioned in the silent part of this, it was -- we set a new record year. We had record production of 752,000 barrels of oil equivalent in a day, which is 50% was liquids. The bulk of that was oil. We had record cash flow, as Patrick pointed out, of $2.7 billion, which on an annualized basis gets us real close to $11 billion for the year. We reduced our debt by $650 million and we funded it our very ambitious investment program. Rod is going to point out a little later, we had an excellent drilling results across the wide portfolio of exploration and development plays around the world during the quarter. And on the project side, we had achievements of positive final divestment decision on our Australian Wheatstone LNG development, a major long-term project with Chevron, it was a visible value over a long period of time, 20 years, with no decline in its -- it's based on oil-linked revenue. Importantly, Wheatstone is really a growth platform, which will provide us multiple additional phases of development that we can bring additional gas in from other discoveries in the Carnarvon Basin. At the opposite end of the Pacific, we obtained a 20-year export license for our proposed Kitimat LNG project on the West Coast of Canada, which is the other long-term oil-linked project in our portfolio. And that moves us closer to our final investment decision there, which should hopefully happen first half of next year. And on the strategic side, we announced the addition of ExxonMobil North Sea business. We added that to our North Sea portfolio, which is a major legacy asset, which has tremendous potential for value upside through the same things that we did at our Forties Field in exploitation capabilities and really geophysical technology. All of that actually happened in a single quarter. Obviously, for us, it's very exciting but what's ahead of us is also very exciting. As market fluctuates, the cash flow strength of our portfolio and the robustness of our balance are key strengths of our company. We're in a position to build 2 major oil-linked projects, Wheatstone and Kitimat, because of the strength of our existing assets, and what Apache's do every day to focus on coming up with efficiencies and economic opportunities in which to grow our production. Every workover and recompletion in the Anadarko Basin, and every discovery in Egypt or the Gulf of Mexico shelf, which is quickly tied in, turns into cash flow to help fund these long-term projects. And as we have launched one of these LNG projects, we're getting ready to embark upon the second one. And it's important to underline that we continue to emphasize our core business, which is bringing value out of our daily operations, which really enables our shareholders to be able to invest in these long-term projects. That, in the future, will provide steady visible cash stream for decades to come. As I'm sure many of you are aware, we're also stepping up our exploration activity, and we have always been an exploration company. If you look at some of the things we've done in Australia, Egypt, and our international shales, all of those were key positions that we built through explorations. What we're now able to do with our enlarged financial and talent resource is to spread out a bit more and take more exploration risks. And you will to some of the elements of that strategy are already taking shape. And we're building a serious exploration business in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We have 110 exploration blocks. We are now the largest acreage holder in the Cook Inlet of Alaska. We're running a big 3D seismic shoot there as we speak. Hopefully, we'll be drilling a well there next year. We're in the Deepwater Canyon. We're drilling oil prospects there next year also. We're an early mover in the unconventional oil play in New Zealand, which ultimately could provide access to about 1.7 million gross acres. All of these opportunities have the potential to be very material to our shareholders from a contribution standpoint. If you look at our history, there is nothing new to any of this. Apache has added a new core area to its portfolio every couple of years over time and build a real business with real value in each one of them. We intend to continue to do that and as well, we continue to squeeze value out of our existing assets to recompletions, workovers and efficiencies.  And with that, I'd like turn it over to Rod Eichler, our President, Chief Operating Officer, to provide operating highlights, and I'd urge him to turn on his mic.
Rodney J. Eichler: Thank you, Steve. In the Permian, our production increased 3% sequentially, driven by strong drilling results than prior period adjustments. We operated 24 rigs during the third quarter with 132 new wells spud, and with initial completion operations started on 171 wells. This increased the level of completion activity has reduced our backlog of wells waiting on completion at the end of the third quarter to 71, which we will continue to work down over the next 2 quarters. The key focus areas of our activity during the quarter continued to be the horizontal redevelopment of legacy water flood units and the multizone zone development of Mariner's Deadwood area. We also continue to progress other plays and projects across the basin where we have about 3 million acres. One notable example is the horizontal climb play at Deadwood, where we have a very positive update.  After somewhat disappointing first test on the previous quarter, our second climb horizontal well came in flowing 325 barrels of oil per day, so 320 Mcf of gas per day after our 10-stage slick water frac and has produced 8,800 barrels of oil equivalent to its first 30 days. We anticipate completing 2 additional climb horizontal wells in the fourth quarter. Moving to the central region, production increased 4% sequentially driven by higher margin in liquid drilling. We operated 9 rigs during the quarter and drilled 18 wells, including 7 Granite Wash, 3 Cherokee, 2 Hogshooter, 2 exploratory wells in the Bivins Ranch. For the year, the region is trying to complete 34 Granite Wash, 14 Cherokee, 11 Hogshooter, 8 Cleveland and one Marmaton well. The region's transformation from vertical to horizontal drilling has evolved over the last 2 years and now the region is targeting the liquids-focused objectives. Since the beginning of 2010, central gas production has increased 11% and oil production has grown over 200%. Acquisition of a 240-square mile 3D survey is underway now across our Bivins Ranch new ventures play, while we had a 75% interest in 126,000 gross acres. And we are already seeing positive well results. Our first well tested over 700 barrels of oil per day from 233 [indiscernible] canyon wash pay. Two additional wells are presently drilling and we expect to be running 2 drilling rigs through the end of the year. In 2012, we expect to drill a minimum of 6 wells on the Bivins Ranch acreage. Gulf of Mexico shelf production was down 4% sequentially, including downtime impact from tropical storms Don and Lee. All the fields affected by the storms are put back into service by the end of the quarter. Unrelated third-party downtime and natural field decline accounted for the remaining drop in production from the prior quarter. We operated 5 rigs on the shelf during the quarter and reached TD of 7 wells with 100% success. We are on track to deliver our target of 41 wells in the shelf this year and we are preparing to ramp up our activities further in this very profitable region in 2012 as the permitting process becomes more predictable.  We grew our block footprint in this region by over 40% last year to over 600 blocks and we have a deep inventory of exploitation of low-risk exploration opportunities ahead of us. In the Deepwater Gulf region, production declined 11% sequentially due to some weather downtime and this timing of new projects coming online. We expect a full [indiscernible] decline in fourth quarter before 3 additional new projects, Mandy, Bushwood and Wide Berth, come on stream next year. Two of these projects were originally scheduled for fourth quarter first production, but is then pushed back due to third-party operator delays.  Our large development projects in Deepwater continue to move forward. Lucius is on track for its final investment decision before year end, and drilling of appraisal well Heidelberg is currently underway. We recently contracted a semisubmersible drilling rig and we are preparing for a deepwater exploration program in the Gulf of Mexico next year.  Gulf Coast onshore region production was up 2.5% sequentially on strong drilling results and new properties on production. We operated 3 drilling rigs during the quarter and participated in 17 wells. In Canada, production declined 3% sequentially driven by property divestments. We operated 8 rigs during the quarter and participated in 48 wells. Activities focused on oil and liquids drilling plays with 28 wells in Provost, 5 wells in Blue Sky, 3 wells in House [ph] Mountain area, 3 wells in Glauconite and one well in the Montney. In addition, we progressed our development plans for the Chinook play, which will start in the fourth quarter. And we move forward one more liquids-rich play within our enlarged acreage, the Gooseberry Sparky play, which alone could represent as many as 37 wells for us next year. Natural gas production continue to be robust. Third quarter Horn River production increased by 18%, as compared to the second quarter that averaged 98 million cubic feet of gas per day net to Apache's working interest, with peak leaping into production approximately 122 million cubic feet of gas per day. Third quarter production levels don't reflect the benefit of our activity in liquid-driven plays yet. And a significant volume of the wells we have drilled that are put in Canada year-to-date are still low on production. The Kitimat LNG project, which Apache operates with a 40% interest has made yet another important step forward with the award by the National Energy Board of Canada of a 20-year export license for a 2-train development of 10 million tons of LNG per annum. This approved throughput double the size of our additional project scope of one train. We continue to work toward our targeted final investment decision in 2012.  In Egypt, net production increased 4% sequentially, driven largely by drilling results. Gross production also grew, up 3%. We operated 25 rigs during the quarter and drilled 57 wells with a 93% success rate, including 7 successful exploration wells in the Faghur, Baharia [ph] and Abu Gharadig basins. We continue to have excellent drilling results in Egypt. We recently achieved a record level oil rate completion since we began operations in the Western Desert in 1996. This completion was an exploration well. The Tayim South 1-X discovery, which tested 8,200 barrels of oil per day. This oil found play in the Cretaceous AEB, Jurassic Safa and Paleozoic formations.  In the Abu Gharadig basin, a development well in the former BP assets tested its 7,600 barrels of oil per day and 1.5 million cubic feet of gas per day for the lower Baharia formation. As an update on the BP assets of Egypt, we have drilled 16 wells with 100% success on the acreage acquired from BP last year. Since becoming an operator last -- we have increased oil production by 34% to 28,000 barrels of oil per day and gas production by 64% to 70 million cubic feet of gas per day. This incremental production has enabled us to fuel the export pipeline we acquired from BP to its current D-rated capacity of 70 million cubic feet of gas per day. We have also completed the [indiscernible] study on this pipeline and we expect to reroute it to 135 million cubic feet of gas per day in 2012 to repair works requiring about 6 months of downtime. This project will add a gross 65 million cubic feet of gas per day to our current export capacity and position us to significantly expand this capacity through looping further down the line. Industry's opportunities of Egypt continue to grow, with 4 million acres now being offered a new licensing round in the Western Desert, the first in almost 5 years. The contractual framework to these 15 blocks on offer is the same one under which oil and gas operations have been conducted in Egypt consistently over the years. This is clearly a positive development for the sector and consistent with Egypt's strong lead for large continued investment by oil and gas companies to meet its energy needs. We are currently evaluating the blocks included in this licensing round. Turning to Australia, production was up slightly from second quarter. Van Gogh production resumed at August and averaged a net 9,700 barrels of oil per day during the third quarter, up 1,000 barrels of oil per day sequentially. It is currently producing a 29,400 barrels of oil per day or 15,500 barrels of oil per day net to Apache. Swivel and compressor performance remain a risk to medium-term production levels, and we are finalizing a solution involving a shipyard remediation program now expected to take place in 2013. We operated one rig during the quarter to Australia and reached TD of 3 offshore wells, 2 of which have been completed as successful offshore oil producers. During the quarter, we achieved a positive final investment decision to our landmark Wheatstone LNG project in which Apache will participate with a 13% interest and which is now moving going forward. Wheatstone had monetized an estimated 2.1 Tcf and 42 million barrels of condensate from our operated Julimar and Brunello fields. Expected investment net to Apache for the combined upstream and LNG projects is approximately USD $4 billion in aggregate through 2016. Average net sells to Apache will be 140 million cubic feet of gas per day and LNG at prices peg crude oil indices 22 million cubic feet of gas per day of sales gas into the attractively priced West Australia domestic market and 3,300 barrels of condensate per day.  Importantly, Wheatstone is a platform for our future growth for the exploration in Australia. The project has already been environmentally approved for nearly 3x the size of this 2-train 9-million ton per annum per space of development. During the third quarter, we achieved final investment approval for yet another oil project in Australia, Balnaves, with gross peak initial production expected in 2014 at 30,000 barrels of oil per day through an FPSO. Apache's interest in the project is 65%. Finally, we can see to progress our existing pipeline [indiscernible] projects. The Reindeer, Devil Creek our second domestic gas processing hub was 98% complete at the end of the third quarter and will be on stream at the end of the year. Apache's interest in this project is 55%. The North Sea region production increased 1% sequentially on exceptional drilling results despite some unplanned infrastructure constraints. We continue to operate 3 rigs, 2 platforms strings and one heavy duty jackup during the quarter and have drilled 15 Forties wells so far during 2011 with 87% success rate. We plan to drill 3 more wells before year end.  Then new Bravo to Charlie pipeline was successfully installed, allowing an extra 4,000 barrels a day to the export beginning in August. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Exxon's Mobil North Sea business, which will significant expand our opportunities set in the region with the addition of the Beryl complex as a second operating area for us. We also gained important midstream assets and an experience in talent organization that will present a terrific addition to our North Sea team.  As Steve mentioned and really the [indiscernible] of Forties has demonstrated Apache's expertise in exploitation of geophysics represents a unique fit for a maturing basin in North Sea, and we are very happy to have finally secured the right assets for our expansion there. We continue to work toward a year-end closing for this transaction. In Argentina, production increased 3% sequentially driven by growth in premium-priced gas production. We operated 8 drilling rigs during the quarter and drilled 11 wells. One highlight of our activity was our resource delineation in our 1.7 million acres within the shale fairway in the Neuquén basin. During the third quarter, we got our first horizontal shale well introduction that reached target depth on 3 vertical wells that will also test the shales. Our first test, the ACL X2000 1H, was completed with 9 fracs on a 2,100-foot horizontal Los Mojos shale section. Initial production is 4.5 million cubic feet of gas per day, and they're selling the gas at $5.22 per Mcf under a Gas Plus contract. That early design in the fracture stimulating program for the other [indiscernible] wells that reached target depth during the quarter. A long and [indiscernible] data obtaining those wells have been very encouraging and our work continues as we appraise a very large resource in a market where it is very seriously needed. Tom?
Thomas P. Chambers: Thanks, Rod. Good afternoon, everyone. As Steve indicated in his opening remarks, record production set the tone for our strong financial performance in the quarter, with record cash flow and very good earnings underpinned by solid margins, results of a balanced portfolio and a focus on holding the line on costs. For the third quarter, Apache reported earnings of $983 million or $2.50 a share, up 18% on a per share basis from the year-ago quarter that's down slightly from the sequential quarter. Adjusting for the FX impact of deferred taxes in the previously announced charge for the tax increase in the U.K., we earned $1.2 billion or $2.95 per share, up 34% from the prior-year period. Cash from operations before working capital items of $50.7 billion, our best quarter ever, was up 35% versus the year-ago quarter and up 2% over the second quarter despite lower realized prices. Our portfolio continues to deliver excellent results with oil currently garnering around 24x the price of North American gas, and our international gas portfolio exposed to rising gas prices, particularly in Australia and Argentina.  Our oil and liquids volumes currently make up 50% of our total production but account for more than 3/4 of our $4.3 billion in revenue. It's important to note that almost 92% of our liquids are crude oil, which sells for almost double the price of NGLs. Further bolstering our revenue generation ability is the fact that nearly 75% of all our oil production receives Brent index or Brent comparable index pricing. This balance allowed us to post solid margins, despite market pressure, which decreased average price realizations by $2 of Boe or 3%. Cash margins of $46.23 per Boe were down less than 2% compared to the prior quarter's $46.96, while pretax margins which include DD&A were $30.26 per Boe versus $31.29 in the prior quarter. We continue to focus on margins and holding the line on cost. As evidenced, total cash cost of $16.29 of Boe decreased $0.40 from the prior quarter and we continue to integrate the prior-year acquisitions. As we mentioned last quarter, cash cost should remain in the range of around $16.50 per Boe given current strip prices for the remainder of the year. A detailed calculation of our margins, adjusted earnings and cash from operations can be found in the financial supplement located in our website. Turning to the balance sheet. One of our core strategies is to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet. Our ability to generate excess cash flow and prudently manage our spending has served us well in this regard. We have to date been able to increase our planned capital expenditures to $8 billion without compromising our balance sheet. Based on current prices, we forecast that not only will we have been able to increase our capital expenditures, but we will be able to pay for the recently announced North Sea acquisition and still meet our debt reduction objectives, all from available excess cash.  This quarter, we paid down $650 million of debt, bringing the balance at the end of the quarter to $7.2 billion which drove our debt-to-capitalization ratio down to 20.5% from 23% at the end of last quarter and 25% at year end. We believe this serves as a critical foundation as we head into 2012 and ramp up our significant long-term growth projects as you heard from Steve and Rod. A key point I need to highlight for the third quarter is our effective tax rate of 52%. The largest impact to the rate was a nonrecurring charge of $274 million for our deferred tax balances as a result of the U.K. tax increase. This we told you about in our last call and wasn't active this quarter, requiring this retroactive adjustment. We recorded a total charge of $305 million in the third quarter, but $274 million is truly out of period, specifically $218 million of the $274 million resulted from the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities prior to 2011 and $56 million is related to operating results for the first and second quarters of this year. This adjustment was partially offset by a $99 million benefit relating to the impact of foreign currency gains on our deferred taxes. Absent any impact of foreign exchange movements, which we really can't predict, we would expect our go-forward effective tax rate to be in the range of 42% to 44% and our deferred tax percentage to average 40% to 45% for the year. To wrap up, we are building a [indiscernible] momentum, heading into the fourth quarter and into 2012. From a financial perspective, rising production, exceptional cash flow, a continued focus on delivering margins and returns and a strong balance sheet give us a solid foundation from which to build future growth and shareholder wealth.  And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger.
Roger B. Plank: Okay. Thanks, Tom. At a time of seemingly unprecedented volatility, we take solace in earning high returns, netting a strong balance sheet and generating substantial excess cash flow. I'm going to update you today briefly on some new business at Apache that improves our lot and supports our ongoing objective of consistent profitable growth. Our North Sea acquisition from ExxonMobil is on track and slated to close at year end. All press right periods have run their course with no exercises, so we should benefit from the full complement of the incremental daily production of around 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent for all of next year. Keep in mind that 2/3 of this production is Brent price crude, currently selling at about $110 a barrel and the remainder is North Sea gas, which goes for around $9.50 per thousand cubic feet. So this is very high-margin production that will contribute meaningfully to our North Sea profits and cash flow throughout next year and beyond. In Australia, during the quarter, we signed 2 new agreements to sell gas at prices substantially above our current realizations. While confidentiality precludes us from disclosing individual specifics, cumulatively, this new business will add approximately 45 million cubic feet of gas per day at variable prices linked to oil and to inflation. These agreements have built-in floor prices that are more than 2.5x our current average realizations of just under $3 per Mcf. The majority of this production is scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter of 2012 and ramp up into 2014. Clearly, strong demands from mining projects is raising the bar for gas pricing in Western Australia. And whilst specific timing for these lumpy demand increases is tied to completion of major projects that is difficult to predict. We now have agreements covering -- agreements in place covering approximately 150 million cubic feet of gas per day at prices that are at multiple of current realizations. These volumes represent some 3/4 of our current productions that will come online between January of 2012 and year-end 2015. That makes for a nice bridge to 2016, which as you've heard, is the time at which our Julimar Wheatstone gas is slated to add another 160 million cubic feet per day of production.  After years in the making, the improvement in Australian gas market fundamentals is upon us, with first sales of significantly higher priced gas finally hitting our coffers beginning this January and volumes rising progressively throughout the coming decade. Consequently, Apache's Australian gas margins and profitability are on track to grow rapidly from here on out. As Steve indicated at the outset, 2011 is shaping up to be a record year for Apache across the board, but it is also a year that has laid a solid foundation for a strong start in 2012. Pat?
Unknown Executive: That includes our prepared remarks. David, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I wanted to follow up on other comments you made. Rod, you just talked about higher prices, starting in January 2012. I guess that's your range to your project. Could you give us an indication of what type of gas prices you expect to see there?
Roger B. Plank: Floor price is 2.5x in excess of $3, about 7.5. So north of that.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. So now you'll see that on the range to your volumes. Can you remind us kind of roughly what those volumes are net to Apache?
Roger B. Plank: Well, there's going to be a commissioning period and it's a very difficult to predict exactly what the timing is. But we'll probably start with about 10 million cubic feet a day in January and ultimately, gross that -- that will rise to 100 million cubic feet of gas per day. How much of that takes place next year is uncertain, but probably the lion's share of it. And we have 55% of that quantity, if you will.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And can you guys kind of comment on the paces of permitting in the Gulf of Mexico? Just trying to get a sense of where your activity levels might be able to go next year. I know this year, obviously, they were certainly hampered.
Rodney J. Eichler: Well, in the, the shallow water area, things have moved along now. This year reveals [indiscernible] including well programs, and we're expecting similar performance next year to go throughout the program. The Deepwater -- things, of course, certainly are slower there since Macondo. Just to give you an idea in the Deepwater areas, it used to take about 45 to 60 days to get a drilling permit approved in the Deepwater. Now, using -- since Macondo, using the [indiscernible] actual data, it takes between 225 and 250 days to get a permit approved all in. So that's -- it's seen some slight improvements in and out of the year, but there's just more additional reorganization regulatory level and the ways to be seen, but that trend will be significantly improving in 2012. I mean, we have been getting permits on our projects, but it's still amazingly slow for the industry.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Question on Argentina, you guys talked about your first shale well, it sounded like a good result. Just trying to get a sense of what that well cost you guys to drill there?
Rodney J. Eichler: I'd have to look that up and have Patrick get back with you and the exact cost. I mean, these early wells are test-of-concept wells. I mean, we drilled pilot holes, take a lot of cores, we do a lot of petrophysical work, almost research side work and we understand the nature of the resource we are dealing with [indiscernible] because there are very few control points they've been targeting specifically for this shale. That's the purpose of one of the placement of the wells, the type of the work program we have. But I'll have Patrick give you the number after the call.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. You guys talked about the Cook Inlet area, you picked up a lot of acreage recently. Can you talk about kind of what's some of your targets are next year? Is it going to be both oil and gas and just kind of give us a sense of the opportunity there?
G. Steven Farris: Frankly, we -- hopefully, by the midyear. We're shooting our 3D as we speak, actually. Hopefully, get to the first pass of some field cubes in the first quarter of next year. But that whole play is all about oil. I mean, we're looking at all the oil plays there and if you look at a [indiscernible] curve of the amount of activities that was in the Cook Inlet before Prudhoe Bay was found and afterward, it just goes flat. So truthfully, we're very excited about the potential of finding reserves with 3D seismic. There's been very little 3D seismic shot out there.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Fine. I guess, I've seen a press story somewhere. Let's talk about you guys looking at spending about $1.5 billion next year in Egypt. Any truth to that number?
G. Steven Farris: Well, I happen to be the chairman of the U.S. Egyptian Business Council and that was in D.C. at a council meeting. I think what I said is between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, which is about -- we're going to spend $1 billion this year and next year, it'll probably be the same. We got 25 rigs running there and we continue to be very active in terms of drilling wells and increasing production. Nothing's changed there, really, for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Bracket with Bernstein Research.
Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Quick question on the Gulf Coast onshore. Can you talk about what sort of plays your targeting? And any news from some of the Southern Louisiana deep prospects?
Rodney J. Eichler: Our programs are -- they range across the coast from South Texas development programs, like at Chafford Ranch [ph], with gas plays around to the South Louisiana myosin plays. We currently have about one well in progress there outside operating at Shalamar and we have -- recently [indiscernible] acquired properties in the quarter from Phoenix, which we're beginning the planning for well exploiting, exploration drilling on those at current time. So we're cutting the early stages of our exploration out there in South Louisiana.
G. Steven Farris: Now that you have been there, I might just elaborate. We'll be looking for some of that deep gas in South Louisiana. We have a huge mineral acreage position there and we've got 3D seismic over. So there's a number of plays that are coming through there. I think that well that Rod mentioned is about 28,000-foot well that we are not operating in, but that's going to be a future for us there also.
Unknown Analyst - : And then another question. On Kitimat, with Shell acquiring some land around your position, have you looked at that property and said no to it and what do you think of them being in that neighborhood?
G. Steven Farris: Janine?
Janine J. McArdle: Yes. They've been in discussions that we understand for quite some time on that property. So we did not look at that specific piece of land. As far as being in that general area, we understand they've been looking in that area for quite some time and they will probably come on the end of this decade and we'll be sometime in the middle. So we're fine.
Rodney J. Eichler: What we're talking about, of course, is the -- specifically is wharf area, the landing area in the harbor, with Shell's acquisition in the former [indiscernible] properties. So we had similar land that we own by buying a similar industrial site adjacent to this. It provides us the same type of access. Of course, the actual LNG site itself is about 15 kilometers to the West of this coast, where our facility will be located.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: In the Permian, when you think about the horizontal opportunities and shifting to more of a horizontal strategy, do you see the Permian competing better for more capital relative to other opportunities within the company or do you just see redirecting more of the Permian's budgets towards horizontal drilling?
Rodney J. Eichler: Well, I'd say, a little of both. The Permian is a premier oil play in ore 48. It competes very effectively inside the company for its share of capital. And likewise, this year, we'll probably drill about 700 wells total in the Permian, of which about 40 are horizontals. Next year, I expect a similar number or perhaps more total wells and probably over 100 horizontal wells. So our program is definitely focused on increasing the number of horizontal drilling opportunities as the basin yields a large number of opportunities that are unconventional reservoirs that's suitable for horizontal exploitation.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. So essentially, your viewing it as more incremental as opposed to reducing verticals, just adding to the budget and then doing more on the -- and adding to the horizontal?
Rodney J. Eichler: We're adding the horizontal, but it's like in the Deadwood area, we've drilled so many wells. In fact, we probably drilled about 200 wells there this year that we've really driven the cost down. So we get more wells per $1 divested in our drilling program by wide margin that we cut the drilling time almost in half in the last 30 months.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then shifting to Australia on Van Gogh, what do you think the existing units can produce per day until 2013 when you begin the remediation?
Rodney J. Eichler: Right now, it's just performing in the last 60 days in about, typically, about 30,000 and 32,000 barrels a gross production in which we probably reflective of ongoing field performance on natural -- the other field recurring basis. So borrowing some mechanical upset, dealing with compression or the swivel of beyond that, expect to see a normal decline through that time period before heading to dry dock to do significant repairs to the vessel. That time, we'll be able to bring the vessel back into the field to not only produce Van Gogh but also tie into our constant field development, which is adjacent to the Van Gogh field.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.
John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Just a follow-up question on what Brian just asked about Van Gogh. I just want to make sure that I understood correctly because I think in the past, you talked about doing the remediation program next year and I just wanted to make sure I understood why it got pushed to 2013?
Rodney J. Eichler: Well, we did lot of work on the vessel this fall. We had a lot of downtime in 2011 in the second quarter associated -- in the first quarter, associated with these repairs. We've made good progress on those. [indiscernible] temporary repairs. They've got very good production levels exceeding our expectations. Those have been performing namely for the last 60 to 90 days. I think this kind of changed our approach. I really [indiscernible] the project going forward to the change from 2012 to 2013.
John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: So a sort of an increased confidence in the actual vessel?
Rodney J. Eichler: Now that's a good way to describe it, yes.
John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then back on the Permian, I apologize if I missed this, how many rigs are currently running in the Permian, is it still the 24?
Rodney J. Eichler: Yes, that's correct.
John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: And I know that in the past, at least, the constraint on trying to add more rigs in that area, a lot of it was on the people side. Is that still sort of the major constraint?
Rodney J. Eichler: It's a combination of both the equipment, as well as good qualified personnel, our experienced personnel. It's an industry [indiscernible] problem across the entire basin.
G. Steven Farris: And a little bit of it is capital because I can't say enough -- if you recall where we were a year ago, when we were talking about what 2011 was going to look like, I mean, we projected to pay down debt, we paid $650 million down this quarter. I think we paid $400 million down the quarter before that. Because when we bought BP, we put ourselves a goal out there to be at about $7.5 billion or thereabout the end of this year. And I think what you're seeing is, is we've been slow to ramp up that activity just because we've got other needs for cash right now. So I think for 2012, what you'll see is, is a start to increase the activity level there and then it will be subject to people and rigs. But right now, it's a capital constraint, though, because we're going to pay down debt first before the end of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company.
Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Steve, a question on Egypt. Just from your expertise [Audio Gap]  I'd love to see what you see as sort of the road paths for a formation of an elected Egyptian government. I think we're supposed to have elections in December, and then how do you see that happening? And ultimately, what do you think it's going to take to give investors more confidence in the Egypt story as it's been an overhang on Apache this year?
G. Steven Farris: Yes, I think what your going -- I think you're going to see, I think they've have announced here recently what the schedule is for the parliamentary and the Shura Council, which is the grand congressional oversight basically, like the Senate in the U.S., the Shura Council. And those are going to take place over a 3-month period, starting I think November 28 and they're going to stagger those across the country. So you won't see final Shura Council elections, I think, until about the middle of March. There is some question as to whether or not the Presidential election will follow immediately or will it be a little time afterward. So you're going -- it's going to be an evolution going forward. And I think, honestly, I think that is a very practical way to go about doing it, because they are evolving into a true democracy and I think you see it in everything that you do and I don't think like anything it's always up and to the right because there are times when things kind of get jagged. But in the scheme of things, they've done a very good job and I don't know why that doesn't continue.
Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: And then switching to the Gulf of Mexico, Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, do you think rig capacity could become an issue if Gulf of Mexico permits really start picking up? Do you think this could be an issue in '12? And how does it impact your plans?
G. Steven Farris: Well, I'll let -- Rod mentioned a little bit about the permitting. I think we've got our first exploration permit as Apache and we're securing a rig. The one thing I would say is, is that all of these things are connected to everything else because rigs are based on cost. And as you see more activity, you're going to see increased cost, you're going to see increased term, which means people are going to have to decide how in the hell they see that. So we're going to be active in the Deepwater. We haven't put that in our plans in terms of hard numbers because we're still trying to understand what's going on with permitting, et cetera. But over time, it is going to be a query from us from an exploration standpoint and the production standpoint. And what's happened out there really has been a benefit to us because we're learning something. And you got to go out into -- we're settled up to some good operators with Anadarko and some other folks. So we're very comfortable with where we are.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I'll try a couple of quick ones. First of all, jumping back to Egypt. Rod, you made some, I guess, some interesting remarks regarding the pipeline. I wonder if you could just elaborate a little bit as to the downtime you anticipate on specifically, I think you said there was room for looping in significant expansion. If you could talk a little bit about what that means in terms of your 100,000 barrels a day production target in Egypt? And I've got a quick follow up, please?
Rodney J. Eichler: With regard to how it fits into the 100,000 barrel they got, it's on top of my head, I'm not sure what that comp would be like. But to give you an idea, I mean, it's certainly be a positive addition to the goal itself and we've had some really good results of the drilling side this year that will add nicely to the goal. But the pipeline itself, after you had [indiscernible] and fully evaluate the [indiscernible] results, actually was a much better condition than we were expecting. There are about 2 dozen places along the line scattered across the entire 260 kilometers when that require well loss greater than 50% that require replacement. The total amount of pipes that needed to replace those, in aggregate, it's only about 4 kilometers of 24-inch pipe. The problem is we have to dig it up in about 25 different places to be able to install it, these limited sections of pipe to effect the repairs. But we're very optimistic that can be done in 2012. I mean, we're going to stay on working through the normal bureaucracy [indiscernible] tenders and everything would procure the piping equipment to get the job done as soon as possible. In the meantime, we're looking at moving the gas around other ways we have in the basin. Perhaps, [indiscernible] flow at our [indiscernible] 18-inch gas pipeline and move it back up. There's this plant up in the North, which we have -- where we have mileage. So there's a lot of possibilities. Ultimately, we will have the opportunity to reap the line. There's a possibility to increase the capacity to access the trunk line that's goes to upper Egypt, which is the main national Grid line, a 34-inch line that goes [indiscernible]. To be able to do that, we'll have to add a small amount of compression that the operated lines are sure [indiscernible] higher pressured pipeline environment.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. So just to be clear, you're running ahead of that kind of the run rate of 100,000 barrels a day currently?
Rodney J. Eichler: I'd say we're making progress toward that goal. We've got 3 years, I believe, that these are ordered 45,000 barrels a day with 100,000 increment.
G. Steven Farris: And another way to look at world of plans for 2011.
Rodney J. Eichler: What our projected plan for 2011. So we're ahead of the longer-term goals too, Doug.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: AlL right. My follow up just real quick on the Permian. I guess, this year, you held your CapEx back a little bit and as you pointed out, your cash flow is well ahead of what you're going to spend. Where are you in terms of being able to step up the activity level in the BP assets that you picked up last year, and I'll leave it at that.
Rodney J. Eichler: Well, we still have a significant effort on bringing the BP assets in the door and integrating the land position, understanding exactly what BP owned and just what's interested the level of development. However, we're checking with plays on it [indiscernible] the way we return basis in places where we had drilling obligations, of course, they're the highest priority other places. We're not really focused specifically on the BP projects. It's really the best opportunities are to achieve the best value for the dollars we're investing. Of course, BP assets are significant part of our position in the Permian Basin, and I expect that we will continue to expand on those properties as time goes by. Right now, our biggest part of our development in the Permian has been focused in the Deadwood area, which is a former Mariner property. So it's bit of very core assets of 100,000 acres that we have to exploit that area.
G. Steven Farris: And then about 1/3 of our rigs are on BP properties right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin from Societe Generale.
John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: Argentina, you had a good well result, there are others to go. What kind of a program ramp are you going to get since you're getting higher gas prices than in the U.S.?
Rodney J. Eichler: What kind of a -- I didn't hear the second part?
John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: Program ramp.
Rodney J. Eichler: Well, our program in Argentina is pretty much tied to our investment level and cash flow in that country at present time. But most of the drilling program is focused partly on our base development of our existing properties, which also includes horizontal drilling in our conventional reservoirs and where we have Gas Plus contracts. And another half is exploration projects dealing with testing the unconventional reservoirs in the [indiscernible] and block [indiscernible] shales principally. I expect to see additional wells, horizontal wells drilled in the shales as a follow up to this year's test-of-concept program in some of these concessions we have. And since we don't have the results of those key vertical wells yet and we won't be able to have those completions underway until probably really the first quarter next year, it's still hard to say what the exact global activity would be.
G. Steven Farris: I've mentioned, too, John that part of this Gas Plus program, this clearly recent program, so kind of gaining its sea legs. Here at floor, a lot of that Gas Plus has gone to quasi-government-owned type electrical generation companies. And now, it's starting to branch out into the rest of industry. So we're very pleased to see of late that's beginning to take hold within a broader industry within the country. And as that continues to pick up, then there'll be more and more of that Gas Plus market that we'll be able to tie our production into.
John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: With the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Steve, you're going to have your first Apache-operated well, you have some non-positions, should we expect just a couple of wells a year in total for Apache overall, on a going-forward basis?
G. Steven Farris: Well, don't know in total. Certainly, you probably are going to see a couple of operated wells -- I mean, a couple of operated wells out of us a year and then whatever our activity level is from our non-operated.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Christensen with Buckingham Research.
Robert L. Christensen - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: On Egypt, again, should I read into the high level of activity there what 23 rigs, almost the same as what you got in the Permian, as a indicator as to your confidence that things will remain constructive and then your comments just now about the new concession not much different than previous concessions. Should we take this all to mean that the confidence, your insights are good for continue business there?
Rodney J. Eichler: From an operating standpoint, it really is, really it's been business as usual. Right through the revolution, the week of the revolution, you can look at our production curve over the last 12 months you'd be hard pressed to point at the curve and say when you think the revolution take place. We've had growing production, as I indicated. So the bureaucracy there is a little slower than normal, I have to say, because there's some confusion again on [indiscernible]  [Audio Gap]  following the concession agreements as they always have and the field operations continue as they have and this announcement is a good round. We haven't had a lot of those for a long time [indiscernible] because this is very encouraging and the terms of government [indiscernible] out are consistent with a big round we've seen in the recent past, including the blocks we have ourselves. So these are all good signs. For the financial standpoint, they haven't missed a beat [indiscernible] on paying us or permitting around our exports for our contracts, everything is working very nicely.
G. Steven Farris: Then I must just add that one difference between Egypt and other countries around them is Egypt really uses all this product in the country that have tremendous growth and use of domestic natural gas about 12% per year for over 5 years. They are right on the cusp of having to import crude oil, they actually import products now. So they need companies that invest in refined oil and gas and we've had a very good relationship there.
Robert L. Christensen - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Final question if I may. One company large E&P in the United States, which is yet to do a JV on its properties is indicating a JV possibility on its properties. They're well healed, you're well healed. Has that been a consideration of Apache to accelerate your activity on such a big base of properties that you have and was augmented last year? I mean, how do you think about those JVs?
G. Steven Farris: I don't think about it. And I don't mean that -- I think that they have a role for some companies and in terms of the way they want to invest, that's really not something that we do. And we have more than opportunities that we can fund right now to take the Permian and what we're doing in Anadarko and what we're doing in Canada. And the stuff that we're doing in the Deepwater, we've got -- we're opportunity-rich and we've got to find what places that we really can add value and that's not looking for [indiscernible].
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. Mr. Cassidy, do you have any closing remarks?
Unknown Executive: Yes. I want to say thank you for participating in the call today. A replay of this webcast and a podcast of the call will be archived on Apache's website later this afternoon. The conference call will also will be available for delayed playback by telephone for one week, beginning at approximately 3:00 p.m. today. And that's it.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Apache Corporation Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded. Today's presentation will be hosted by Mr. Tom Chambers, Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor Relations. Mr. Chambers, please go ahead.
Alfonso Leon: We got the old script. This is Alfonso Leon. I'm Vice President of Planning, Strategy and Investor Relations. So good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Apache Corporation's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we reported second quarter 2011 net income of $1.2 billion or $3.17 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $1.3 billion or $3.22 per diluted share. Cash flows from operation totaled $2.6 billion. On today's call, we will have 3 speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Roger Plank, President and Chief Corporate Officer; and Tom Chambers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer is actually on jury duty today. We have prepared our usual detailed supplemental data package for your use, which includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we used, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or costs incurred. The data package can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financialdata. Today's discussions may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions, and no assurances can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
G. Farris: Thank you, Alfonso. Despite what we're seeing in the broad market today, Apache, very positive and proud of the quarter we turned in. I know you probably know that we had record production of 749,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, which was up 2% sequentially. We posted our second highest quarter of adjusted earnings ever of $1.3 billion, record cash flow of $2.6 billion, and actually, the only quarter of earnings we've ever had better than this was in the second quarter of 2008 when the commodity prices were -- moved to $140 range. Clearly, our results in the second quarter were strong and really were driven by our portfolio's strength and the asset rate of return focus of all Apaches. We had notable discoveries in a number of our regions during the quarter, and in addition, we took important steps forward in future growth projects which included Balnaves, our Lucius in the Deepwater, Deadwood, Wheatstone LNG and Kitimat LNG. The quarter underlines the strength of our cash flow generation. Our $2.6 billion of cash flow was up 44% from the same period a year ago. So if you analyze that, that's probably less than this today with our share of price going down today. If you analyze it, would imply share trade price at about 4x our cash flow. Cash flow is our fire power. Our balance sheet has grown to -- or cash balance has grown to $1.1 billion at the end of June, which puts us in a good position to take on new projects or asset investment opportunities if and when they arise. We're very careful with our cash and staying focused on rates of return has served us well over the years, and that's not going to change in the current environment. Rod Eichler is on jury duty, so I'm going to give you a little highlights from the operating side. In the Permian region, production increased 9% sequentially, which was driven by the absence of weather disruption we experienced in the first quarter, a very aggressive drilling program at Wolfcamp at Deadwood, our horizontal drilling results in our legacy water flood units and prior period adjustments. We operated 24 rigs during the quarter and drilled 146 wells, 13 of which were horizontal. We completed 137 wells and as we continue to ramp our frac spread capacity to catch up with our drilling activity. Our horizontal redevelopment of the Permian legacy water flood units continues to yield very positive results. The TXL South unit, one of the 6 out of 28 water flood fields in which we have initiated horizontal redevelopment hit 3,500 barrels a day, which is a 23-year record, and this field has been under water flood for 43 years. So far this year, we drilled 7 horizontal wells in the unit. A big driver in the second quarter was the TXL South unit, 5210, which is a horizontal well testing at 531 barrels a day and 450,000 cubic feet of gas a day. These wells are increasing the recovery from the field by contacting unswept reserves that would ever otherwise be left behind, and the results we've seen in this field and a number of other fields gives us tremendous potential in all of our water floods in the Permian. We ran 11 rigs and drilled 57 wells in the Deadwood field. We're concentrating our activity this year in the Wolfcamp due to land retention requirements. Gross oil production in Deadwood exceeded 5,000 barrels a day and 14 Mcf of gas a day at the end of June, which compares with 2,000 barrels a day and 6 Mcf a day at the beginning of the year.  Our gas volumes have potentially plateaued in this area due to the midstream constraints, which the recently announced across Texas JV, the joint venture will address in early 2012. We expect to drill 160 wells in Deadwood this year, and at this point, we have an inventory of an additional 575 vertical locations there. During the second quarter, we completed our first climb horizontal in the Deadwood area. It tested at 77 barrels a day, which was less than our expectations. We intend to change our frac design on our second well, which is currently drilling. We continue to address and build our inventory in the Yeso, the Empire Abo, Southeast New Mexico, Rio too plus Bravo [ph] and we have a couple of new venture plays that we're working on. Apache has built a strong portfolio in the Permian, really, throughout a consistent contrarian approach over many years. And today, we have decades of attractive opportunities ahead of us. We've already identified 7,500 drilling locations, and if we stop today, we'd be able to drill wells for several years in the future. And in Central region, production increased 7% sequentially, which were driven primarily by increase in our oil production, and notably, oil production in the region has increased 60% year-to-date alone. The region ran 10 rigs during the quarter and drilled 21 wells, almost entirely horizontal. The focus of our activity were in the Granite Wash with 10 wells, 3 oil plays in the Cherokee and Cleveland and Hogshooter with 5, 4 and 2 wells respectively. Average well results across these plays continue to meet or outperform our expectations, and we expect they at least maintain our current level of activity across these plays on multiyear basis. Some individual highlights per play during the quarter included the Cherokee well that stabilized at 577 barrels of oil a day and 900,000 cubic feet of gas a day, a Cleveland well that tested 717 barrels of oil per day and a Hogshooter well that flowed at about 1,150 barrels a day and 4.5 Mcf of gas a day. Production in the Gulf of Mexico shelf region was down 2% sequentially due to the level of activity constrained by permitting issues and natural field decline. We operated 5 rigs in the region during the quarter. Reached TD on 6 wells with 100% commercial success, and we remain on track to drill up 41 wells this year and really look forward to resuming our normal pace of 60 wells next year as we begin to exploit the upside associated with our 40% acreage expansion and underexploited [Audio Gap] all Apache Gulf of Mexico [Audio Gap] If you look at that on [Audio Gap] Throughout the region, production declined about 3.5% sequentially.  [Audio Gap]  quarter a successful well test was conducted in the Lucius field, which is operated by Anadarko. In addition, the utilization of Lucius with adjacent acreage belonging to Exxon Hadrian partnership was finalized. These steps positioned Lucius for an investment decision this year with first production in 2014. The capacity of the facility is expected to be 80,000 barrels of oil a day and about 450 Mcf of gas a day. Apache holds 11.67% interest in the enlarged Lucius complex. We continue to progress Heidelberg and a number of other projects. Importantly, we have now received approval on 2 out of 4 exploration plans we have submitted year-to-date. We have 110 exploration blocks in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We're eager to get after an active exploration program to expand our position, hopefully, somewhat slimmer that we've done in the shallow waters. We're the dominant player there now. In the Gulf coast onshore, production was up 10% sequentially on the back of an active drilling program and recompletion program. We operated 4 rigs during the quarter and drilled 21 wells. We continue to build opportunities in this area, tremendous site of carbon-rich region, provides an excellent fit with Apache's exploitation capabilities and contrarian philosophy. In Canada, production was down 1% sequentially, mainly due to weather, wildfire and pipeline disruptions, in addition, the normal reduction of our activity after spring break out. We operated 3 rigs in Canada during the quarter and participated in 12 wells that reached TD. In the third quarter, we are currently projecting an approximately 1,800 barrels of oil per day and unscheduled production disruptions due to pipeline downtime and ongoing flooding in some areas. Change gears a little bit, the Kitimat LNG project, which Apache operates with a 40% interest has taken important steps forward. We're near the conclusion of the hearings for the 20-year export license, and we recently announced the acquisition of an industrial site near the project's current LNG site, plant site. And this additional site has a large amount of land, which hosted a paper mill and marine export facility in the past. Due to the timing of feed work, we are now targeting a final investment decision in the first quarter of 2012. We remain committed to a target date for first production in late 2015. Kitimat LNG is a landmark step not just for Apache but for the industry, and we are very excited about leading the charge on this project that if sanctioned, will generate large predictable cash flows for our shareholders for decades to come. Moving to Egypt. Despite what you read in the papers, Apache has no interest in entering the Israeli gas markets. I don't have any idea where that came from. Some of our joint venture folks did meet with the Israeli minister of petroleum but that was really -- had nothing to do with investing in that country, and not that we wouldn't invest there, we're very happy in Egypt. We intend to stay there for many years. We operated 24 rigs in Egypt during the quarter, drilled 53 wells with a 91% success rate. I might say that Egypt production was -- on a gross basis was actually up slightly, but was down 7% in net terms due to timing of our cost recovery and higher oil prices. Our exploration program delivered broad-based success across the region during the quarter. 18 exploration and appraisal wells yielded 13 new discoveries. Five of our discoveries were in the Faghur basin, and we made 2 discoveries in each of them through Abu Gharadig and Shusham [ph] and Beni Suef basins. These discoveries have also furthered some of our new plays as 2 of them encountered the Paleozoic, one which was delivered stratigraphic target in the Matruh basin. We're still testing some of them. Each discovery potentially opens up a population of future locations for our inventory. We should be at 26 rigs in Egypt over the coming weeks as we ramp up our activity in oil and unconventional plays in the country. In Australia, production was up 8% sequentially, reflecting improved FPSO performance in Van Gogh, stronger-than-forecasted performance at Pyrenees and the contribution of new wells onstream in our Stag field. We operated 2 rigs in the region during the quarter and drilled 3 wells, yielding 2 significant new discoveries at Zola and Valmy steep.  Our Halyard development commenced production in June and averaged about 45 Mcf of gas a day and 819 barrels of condensate for the month. The Halyard explorer will continue to ramp up through 2013 with a peak production of 110 Mcf of gas a day and about 2,000 barrels of condensate as processing capacity becomes available at Varanus Island. Apache has a 55% working interest in this project. Van Gogh production averaged 8,700 barrels of oil per day net to Apache in the second quarter, which is up from 3,800 barrels a day in the first quarter. Production was halted on June 10 for a central maintenance program and resumed on August 2. Frankly, the downtime and unreliability of this third-party vessel remains a serious concern and we are currently working on a potentially longer-term shipyard remediation program for 2012. We continue to progress our project pipeline in Australia. During the second quarter, we sanctioned Valmy's oil development project, which is expected to deliver initial production of about 30,000 barrels a day in 2014 and Apache has 65% working interest in this project. In addition, last week, we announced Wheatstone LNG execution of a major debt sales agreement with TEPCO. This is an important milestone for our efforts to reach final investment decision this year. Wheatstone LNG, which is operated by Chevron, will produce 8.9 million tons per annum starting in 2016, and Apache has a 13% interest in their overall project. Turning to the North Sea, production was up 22% sequentially, driven by truly outstanding drilling results, reduced pipeline downtime and the consolidation of our interest with Nelson. We operated 2 rigs in the Forties field during the quarter and drilled 6 wells and 2 wells to highlight our first to Charlie 4 or 3, which started production at 12,567 barrels a day, which is the best initial production of any well in the field since 1990. And the second to Delta 3 and 5 commenced production at a rate of 8,781 barrels of oil per day, which wasn't too shabby either. These wells result really stand from a combination of improved 4D seismic imaging. Our refined drilling practices, we've been there a number of years now and better performance on our well completions. Forties is the largest oil accumulation in the U.K. North Sea with 5 billion barrels of oil in place. We've produced about 2.5 billion of those barrels. We expect many years of continued profitable investment opportunities in the field. We're installing the new Bravo-Charlie production pipeline, which went commissioned in September. We'll restore the remaining 4,000 barrels of oil a day of production shut in due to the pipeline issues. We are currently experiencing a field-wide 5-day production shutdown, which we expect to end tomorrow as the operator of the Forties pipeline system removes World War II ordinances found in the area. One last note on the North Sea is that one of our rigs is now on location at the Bacchus development project, which we expect to come on stream in the fourth quarter this year. Turning to Argentina, production was up 10% sequentially driven by an increase in premium priced Gas Plus contracts. We operated 6 rigs in Argentina during the quarter, reached TD on 7 wells, 5 Gas Plus and 2 vertical oil producers. Other wells that have not reached TD yet include 4 important exploration wells and a significant horizontal oil test that could open up a number of opportunities for us. Our natural gas realizations in Argentina increased from $2.18 in Mcf in the first quarter to $2.74 in Mcf in the second quarter. It was driven by second quarter Gas Plus volumes of 77 million a day with an average price of about $4.93 per Mcf. Gas Plus production is subject to a 12% royalty. One of our Gas Plus development highlights was the first horizontal multifrac drilled in Pre-Cuyo tight sands, which is flowing over 10 million a day after more than 2 months of production. We're going to follow up this concept with additional wells later on in the year. We have completed frac-ing the first horizontal multifrac well, targeting a shale formation in Argentina. We're currently opening up some of the fracs and recovering frac fluid. On a final note, in Argentina, during the quarter we gained entry into a fourth basin in the country, the Noroeste basin through a 50% interest and 516,000 acre block with both conventional and unconventional exploration opportunities. Our partner is Gran Tierra, and we expect the first well to be drilled there in 2012.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom Chambers our Chief Financial Officer.
Thomas Chambers: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everybody. Apache turned in another very solid financial performance in the quarter, reporting earnings of $1.24 billion or $3.17 per share for the second quarter, up $125 million from the prior quarter. Adjusted for certain items that impact the comparability of results such as foreign currency fluctuation and deferred taxes and merger acquisition and transition costs, we earned $3.20 a share, up 11% from the prior quarter. Higher daily production, combined with significantly higher oil prices, increased cash from operations 18% over the first quarter of '11 to $2.6 billion, our best quarter ever. As Steve indicated in his remarks, our portfolio continues to deliver excellent results. Our oil and liquids volumes currently make up 49% of our total production but account for more than 3/4 of our total revenue of $4.3 billion. This was driven by the fact that the majority of our international oil production is in indexed to Brent crude price and over half of our U.S. oil production receives significant premiums to WTI prices. Our average price realizations increased 7% over the first quarter, and despite pressure on costs, our cash and pretax margins also increased by 7%. Cash margins rose to just under $47 of boe and pretax margin, which includes DD&A rose to $31.29 per barrel of oil equivalent. You can find the details of these in the financial supplement located on our website. We remain focused on operating cost, which manifests itself in our bottom line margins. In that regard, our total cash costs for the balance of the year should remain in the range of $16.50 per boe at current strip prices. At the end of the quarter, our debt-to-capitalization ratio was under 23%, down slightly from 24% at the end of last quarter. Higher prices and production plus the sale of a small Canadian property package drove free cash flow generation, enabling us to reduce debt by $380 million to $7.85 billion and increased cash on the balance sheet by $750 million to $1.1 billion. As we indicated last quarter, most of the free cash on our balance sheet is currently located outside of the United States. Turning to taxes. Our second quarter effective tax rate was 41%, on par with our first quarter, and our deferred tax percentage was 34% in line with where we expect to see our deferred rate for the year. The previously announced U.K. supplemental tax increase became law when it received royal signage July 19. The 12 percentage point increase, which takes our effective rate to 62% was retroactive to March 24 of this year and will result in a nonrecurring charge of approximately $230 million plus the catch-up charge of approximately $60 million for the year-to-date through June, both of which will be reflected in our third quarter earnings. Absent the impact of foreign exchange movements and the corresponding impact of our deferred tax balance, our worldwide effective tax rate should average around 45% for the full year, primarily driven by the U.K. tax rate increase. To sum up, we had a very solid quarter and look to continue to build on this momentum. Our focus remains on margins and returns as well as cost and production growth, which allows us to achieve our balance sheet goals. And with that, I'll turn it over to Roger.
Roger Plank: Okay. Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to comment very briefly on our progress year-to-date as it's truly been at an exceptional first half. After a very active 2010 in terms of capturing opportunities to strengthen our portfolio and expand our long-term growth horizons, the digestion and integration process could not be going much better. Our first half production was up 20% from the year ago, and as you've heard, it's driving exceptional financial returns. South first half cash flow this year of nearly $5 billion is higher than we planned, enabling us to meet our debt-reduction objectives, increased our planned capital expenditures by some $600 million to $8.1 billion and build our cash balances rapidly now. Growing our production and having instant cash flow with which to pursue opportunities for continued profitable growth really gives us a true competitive edge. Our portfolio approach and earlier contrarian decisions are also paying off. Tom commented on how our ample weighting of oil production is driving our financial results. I just like to note that while our North American prices in the first half on the oil side rose $20 to $94 a barrel, our international realizations claimed $32 to $107 a barrel and on just over 200,000 barrels of oil per day that internationally, that generates meaningful additional cash flow. In international gas, along the line for not being exposed to North American natural gas markets, is also beginning to see its day in the sun. While North American realizations declined in the first half from a year ago, our international gas prices climbed 25% to just over $3.60 per Mcf. This direction is likely to continue and make an even greater impact in Apache's future as our international gas volumes rise along with international gas prices. So rising production, strong cash flow and a deep inventory of drilling opportunities, all of that puts Apache in a very strong competitive position from which it delivered continued profitable growth. Steve, you want to wrap things up?
G. Farris: Thank you, Roger. I'd like to conclude our prepared remarks by thanking all of you who attended our Investor Day in New York. Actually, we had more than doubled the number of people as we anticipated. Obviously, we appreciate your time and your level of engagement. We're very conscious. This is not easy to model the full value of Apache in a diversified growth enterprises. We are -- we have 10 regions, global regions and a broad portfolio of projects and plays. We're making every effort to bridge that challenge. At the Investor Day, we had our current inventory of projects over the next 5 years and the full economics of all of them. We have more opportunities today than any time in our 6 decades as a company, and honestly, at the end of the day, it's actually putting money in the bank and making good investments and not as how good you tell a story. We may be headed over the next 2 or 3 years and some of our best years we put back-to-back in several years. And if you want to look at our future, the best way to do that is learn our past. Because if you look at our last 5 years for growth or 5 years before that, we've had significant profitable growth over a long period of time. We continue to be a driven company, and we truly are just getting started.  And with that, I think we'll turn it back over to Alfonso.
Alfonso Leon: Operator, we're ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: I have a couple of questions on the strong rates that you saw out of the Faghur basin in Egypt and the 2 wells in the Forties field. I think that represents about 12,000 barrels a day in Egypt and about 20,000 plus in the North Sea. The questions are first, how many additional similarly looking opportunities do you believe have been derisked by these wells? And second, should we expect to see a jump in production in these 2 areas or has that already been reflected with the quarterly results?
G. Farris: Well, it certainly -- let's start with Egypt because it's -- honestly, we just not scratched surface in the Faghur Basin because each one of those wells are either the exploration well on a separate fault block or if it's not that first well, it's a second appraisal well. And we have a number of projects to do there. Our biggest constraint for a little while is going to be -- if you recall about a year ago or year and half ago, we put in some oil facilities to add the oil that we got at Phiops and also gas facilities because we were starting to get more gas in this area. The fact of the matter is we are going to be pretty full, it's starting in about September again for a while until we expand those facilities. In terms of our sequential growth in Egypt, you got to be careful watching the quarter out. I wish we could post both our gross operated, as well as our nets because just depending on what happens, the close of the quarter, our cost recovery. [Audio Gap] but we expect to continue to grow our oil production in Egypt. [Audio Gap] Brian, so we have tremendous opportunities there. And the North Sea, it really has been startling. We did finally process here I think about 8 months ago the 4D that we have shot and got final processing on our latest 4D, and obviously, the evolution of that technology gets better and better and we get better at it. But there's -- I think we probably have 50 prospects, but I couldn't have said that. It's a little bit like the Granite Wash horizontal well. We have had 50 projects for the last 3 or 4 years. So I would expect right now, we are constrained there a little bit with respect to facilities. We are putting in a satellite platform. I think the guys went over, the gals went over it when we were at the Investor Day. We're putting in -- I think it's going to have 18 slots that we can also, not only drill water injector wells but we can also have facilities to increase our oil production, and both of those have potential of increasing from where they are today. Yes, and that's both of those plays. Thank you though.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And this as a follow-up to that and I apologize if you did already mention this. Did you say where growth levels were in Egypt? I didn't notice that it did tick your line.
G. Farris: Well, the slide we have but I don't have it in front of me. I think we did 217,000 barrels a day or 1,000 barrels a day and 881 Mcf gas a day, but 1 Mcf a day but I don't normally see that.
Alfonso Leon: And Brian, we do have that line now in our supplemental disclosure.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then lastly on Egypt and on Argentina, can you just talk about demand trends that you're seeing, I guess, particularly for Egypt where I know you haven't been disrupted at all, but I wonder if you've seen any changes in the pace of demand growth and then in Argentina as well?
G. Farris: In Argentina, I will tell you, they are -- I got to be careful now. They need gas because they are importing gas from Bolivia, and they're also supporting LNG cargoes, pretty significantly, prices above our current price that we're selling to them. We've had indications that we will be able to produce into that Gas Plus market whatever we put into it, and well, that remains to be seen but we're taking them at their word. We'll continue to drive the increase of Gas Plus volumes. In Egypt, frankly, we have seen no downturn in demand because of the activities that have gone on over there. They've grown their demand about 12% a year for the last 5 years, and frankly, they still burn about 135,000 barrels of diesel there. So the gas price, like the gas price in most parts of the world are significantly lower on a BTU equivalent in Egypt as they anywhere else in the world. So I don't see that demand for gas abating. Our biggest problem is takeaway again, and we have now run our intelligent pig and the pipeline to the South. It has some spots in it that have 80% line loss, so we have to cut that back little bit. But we now have enough data to be able to go in there and fix that, which we intend to do, and we should be able to ramp that up significantly honestly before the end of the year. So we have potential to increase our gas production in Egypt also.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: I got a couple of quick ones. Steve, if I could just jump on to the Egyptian follow-up questions I guess given your comments there. So just to be clear, the -- how much of the 300 million a day that you currently have, I guess, behind pipe, do you think you'll be able to release once that pipeline is fully repaired to the level of integrity you're happy with?
G. Farris: I would think probably 67 million a day.
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: And that would be by the end of this year?
G. Farris: Yes, ramp it up until the end of this year. We won't have [indiscernible] I hope I'm not getting that in front of our guys in Egypt but I think that's probably right. I had that propensity.
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: Now this is typically fairly rich gas, so do you get some liquids coming out of this as well?
G. Farris: We do and I will tell you, we've had -- the Abu Gharadig plant had a small fire, and so we're really not being able to separate down to the liquids portion. We're getting off the time cycle, but we're able to separate the liquids. And we haven't been able to do that for about the last 3 months. That should be fixed this summer, by the end of the summer.
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. And I apologize for this one but I guess somebody's got to ask it. Can we just get your kind of broad update as to how the political situation is, the pipe's outlook and whether or not you're current on your payments in terms of your receipts, I should say?
G. Farris: Yes, we're no different but with respect to our payments, things haven't changed a bit. In terms for Apache, with respect to -- I will tell you I was there June 7, 8. We have the U.S.-Egyptian business council meeting there. We had 24 major companies, not just oil companies but U.S. companies that made that trip, Google, Microsoft, Citibank, Exxon, a number of companies that are much obviously much larger than us and talked to a number of people. Obviously, they have -- things have changed. Certainly, I will tell you the enthusiasm there is as great as I've seen it since we've been over there 15 years. People are generally very positive. Most of them are very positive about what's going on. And they all recognize that they have -- it'll just them take awhile from an economic standpoint. But I'm, obviously, I'm optimistic because we drill wells for a living. But I don't see any real concern. We're sensitive to it, but not concerned, I guess, is the way I would put the words.
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: Got it. And last one for me I guess, I keep going awhile. I'll let someone else jump on here. But the last one is on Nelson. Given the extent of the success that you're obviously having on Forties and I guess the fact that Shell's been kind of sitting on their hands for quite a while on Nelson, any update you can give us in terms of progress of maybe increasing that stake or getting more involved, more active in the actual redevelopment fund if there is such a thing? And I'll leave it at that to you.
G. Farris: No, I think any place we're not operator, we probably would like to get more involved. Yes, I think you asked the right question. We're going to see whether or not it's beneficial to us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: A couple of questions. Steve, can you talk about Canada? You briefly hit it, but can you talk about exploration-wise what you're most excited about?
G. Farris: We were just up there. We had quarterly review up there and spent a day and half. And I tell you, we had a lot -- the thing I'm most -- it's short term because I'm excited about a lot of number of things. I think short term is when you look for either oil or liquid-rich gas, you can find it, which I was and our folks like in what we call the Kaybob area is we got some zone discussions real potential and some of the offset players are drilling and making dang good wells. But we've got a huge acreage position in there and starting to drill some wells in there. I think we have 2 or 3, but the Provost oil play, I mean that's 3,000 feet, but it's oil. And we got probably 1 million acres in there, although it's not going to be productive, but its huge acreage position. We've got -- the good thing about having acreage is you've got lots of chances to win, and we have a huge acreage position up there and whether it is the Montney, Ridgewood liquid-rich. We've got a bunch of acreage in there. We've got it in the Gano [ph] play. We've picked up an awful lot of good acreage from BP that we didn't even put value on when we did it, frankly. We didn't need that value at the time. I would say one thing is we're going to be able to find some liquids and some black oil up there, and I really didn't expect the oil.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. And are things back to normal in Canada yet, post the weather and then the rains and everything kind of slowed things down. Are you back?
G. Farris: Well, we're getting back. Alfonso, you might...
Alfonso Leon: Yes, we expect at this point for the third quarter, 1,800 barrels per day net of continued disruption due to pipeline downtime and ongoing flooding.
G. Farris: But in terms of our activity level, we're starting to put rigs back to work.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. One more question. Can you do anything with the FPSO. You briefly mentioned, but I mean what's -- just give us the current state of...
G. Farris: We're back on. I don't know what the production was today. I think it's a little over 20,000 barrels a day gross in the Van Gogh field. We expect to -- if we it everything or is working right, we hope to get it up at about 34,000 to 35,000. We got the 52% in that. And it's not -- let me tell you, it's a beautiful permeable zone, which is great and you get rates out of it but it will decline. So not unlike any of the deepwater stuff in the world. But it has been very hit and miss, frankly. I don't know if you follow it, but we had a swivel problem, we had it there at excess [ph]. We had an anchor problem. We had haul it off from big step [ph]. So the last 45 days or thereabouts, 40 days, the boat owner took it off the location and did a major overhaul of a number of components, and we are just now back online the last couple of days. So we will -- it's not costing us anything other than loss production.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. Is there insurance for that loss production?
G. Farris: No.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. But it sounds like as of now, if this works you're content where you're at right now with that.
G. Farris: Yes, if we can make it run, we've had about 40% up time over the last 6 months, and that for a field that's producing black oil and 110, well Brent's 120 there for awhile, I mean that's a hell of a lot of cash flow we're missing out on.
Roger Plank: And we do think of it as loss production but in reality it will be deferred production.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company International: Steve, can you provide a little bit of overall outlook on the deepwater Gulf of Mexico? And when do you think it becomes a significant growth platform for the company?
G. Farris: I tell you that's a $64,000 question. I will tell you we're starting to see, and I'm talking about not our activity level. It's much of the industry's activity level because it's -- our expectations were by the end of this year, we ought to be in pretty good shape with exploration permits, et cetera. I think it's slower than everybody expected. I think it is becoming more clear as to what you need to submit and your time frames. I mean basically, we just had a quarter review in both on the shelf and the deepwater here about a week and a half ago for third and second quarter. But if you look at the permitting of whether it's a well or development well, whatever, we just pushed the clock back 3 to 6 months from the time period it used to take, which means we're going to have to do better planning, not only in the deepwater but on the shelf and get our ducks in order and try to do it a little more systematically. And we used to be able to drag a rig out there and drill well. In terms of it being a significant driver for Apache, honestly it's going to take 3 years. I think what's happened on Lucius and Exxon's well, I mean, it's gorgeous but I think I'm not supposed to say that. They announced 700-foot column, but it indicates kind of things you can find in the deepwater. And we built a staff around the Mariner folks, but we're also building -- we have a technical group. That is a strong technical group. So I would see us, over time, increasing our interest and blocks that we've gotten from Mariner and also drilling some wells as the operator.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company International: And just following up on divestitures. Earlier this year, you all had mentioned about a $1 billion, I believe, of divestitures, maybe half in Canada, half in the U.S. I know you got some divestitures done this quarter. If you could just catch us up on where you are in that process?
G. Farris: Roger?
Roger Plank: Yes, we got one sale done in Canada. It was just under $200 million. It's about -- first quarter, those properties produced 25.5 Mcf a day and 500 barrels per day. And we've got another comparable sale that we're working on and would hope to complete in early to mid-September.
G. Farris: And honestly, what happened is, is that we got more cash than thought we were. We're not selling what we don't think we're selling cats and dogs. And so some of the things that we were marketing, we didn't get a price that we thought was the good price and so we kept them.
Roger Plank: Along those lines, we got a package in the U.S. that we are currently marketing, and we would have the same comments about that. If we get a price that we like, we'll take it. And because we don't have pressure to sell because we've got higher cash flow and cash, we don't, we'll keep it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Freeman with Raymond James.
John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: In Argentina, I apologize if I missed this, but what were the sales on -- the Gas Plus sales either during the quarter the most recent data and then the average price on those sales?
Roger Plank: I think it's 77 million a day at 493 or something, like that. Yes, that was it.
G. Farris: That's the average for the year. Fourth quarter.
John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And in the North Sea, I know going into the quarter, you all were expecting about 6,600 net barrels a day of production down for planned turnarounds. Does any of those turnarounds carryover in the third quarter and if so, the amount?
G. Farris: No. We are currently should be back up tomorrow, but we have an unplanned event where the Forties pipeline operator, and you could figure out who that is, we had to shut in all of the oil behind that pipeline for 5 days because they found some ordinances along that pipeline. And we should be back up day after tomorrow.
John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then last question for me, you all have gotten a pretty sizable position now in the Cook Inlet in Alaska, and I'm just trying to get a sense of how to think about that. I know that the concept is kind of the lack of 3D seismic coverage, so you shoot it and you get the work with it, but sort of the timing on when you would shoot it, when you actually start to drill up there.
G. Farris: We had not finite number, stepping in front of our guidance, again, but we have led the contract on that, and it's going to be a large shoot and it will be 3D. And hopefully, we will be done with that by the end of this year in terms of first pass processing and hope to drill a well in 2012. We got -- its exploration play but the guys have wowed me enough me to believe that it's a real opportunity.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Just only thing that your gas price in Australia has picked up a fair bit in the last couple of quarters here. Just wanted to get a sense from you guys kind of what's caused that. Maybe there were some legacy contracts to the lower price, that it rolled off and perhaps you could just sort of address your current contracts and when some of those at lower prices may roll off in the next couple of years.
G. Farris: Well, I don't have in front of me specifically the numbers. I know we are putting on some gas like Halyard going in at a higher price. But our legacy contracts really will start to roll over in 2013 and 2015. And we're also in the midst of negotiating some contracts from Macedon, which were not operator, but that will come on in 2013. The operator of BHP there but the contracts are in the 7-day dollar range. So you're going to see not just for the last 2 quarters over the next 2 or 3 years. You're going to see our gas price in Australia change significantly.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Great, okay. And I guess speaking with Australia just wanted to get a sense of what else is on the docket this year in terms of the larger exploration wells you guys plan on drilling?
G. Farris: Yes, let me think. Well, we keep extending step. Probably the best thing we have is a step around at Zola. I think we're scheduled and I'm not sure it's the end of this year or first quarter of next year. We've got play an incredible well at Zola, which is going to be big gas line for us and nobody -- we can't tell -- we're going to appraise it. But the good thing about that is, if we go to FID with Wheatstone, we have the potential of putting significant more volumes of gas in Wheatstone, which is the whole purpose of that is not just Julimar. The whole purpose of that is to expand our gas markets in Australia. We drilled a dry hole at Emerson, which was off of 356. We had totally different kind of stratigraphic play off of 356 was the Julimar area or way out to the East. And I think right now that's -- I can't think of anything in front of us this year anyway.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Got you, okay. And I guess clearly, you guys just announced a couple of nice discoveries there in Egypt just curious as to sort of how many other wells you have left to drill in the exploration site in Egypt this year as well?
G. Farris: We probably got 14 more wells to drill this year on the exploration side. I think probably -- they're actually appraised. Let me put it that way. Some are probably drilling right now, but we haven't seen the results. What we found is -- frankly, 2 things we found that I would comment on. One is the Faghur Basin area is the oilier, and we see the Sapa, oil Sapa, which is really a plus for us over there because it's not the a, b, which is upper, the upper part of the zone, lower Cretaceous is great production, but it declines quickly. And what you see out of the Sapa is they've more staying power. And the other thing I would say is that we've been pleasantly surprised with what we found on the stuff we acquired from BP because when we talk about gas, being able to pull gas out of a call though, we're to the point when we get that pipeline fixed. We're not on that pulling gas out of Gharadig. We're finding it. We're finding it Abu Gharadig acreage that got from BP, which is a real plus.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. So I guess just to make sure I understood that, are you saying you that you have drilled some exploration wells on the BP acreage at this point and you found more gas?
G. Farris: Yes.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale.
John Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: Some quick ones for me. How encouraged are you in Egypt for the Paleozoic, Steve?
G. Farris: Honestly, the jury is still out, but I've always been encouraged by it, frankly. I don't have the settle of having data. Well, there's no reason why it doesn't exist out there. What we continue to kind of step out there and do is we encourage ourselves every time we drill down through the Paleozoic, and we continue to get encouraged by that. My thought is go out there in the middle of nowhere and drill a well. We haven't had that courage yet, because I really think that you have a real shot at it. But the last 2 wells that we drilled, they definitely had pay at the Paleozoic which is good.
John Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: Okay, good. With Argentina, you said you were going on conventional with shale test. Say, you're successful there going forward, how hard will it be to build up infrastructure because you probably had to bring in frac tarps from all over to do it right?
G. Farris: Well, yes, the infrastructure from the pipeline -- the good thing about Argentina is they got all kinds of pipelines across from that Neuquén basin. The bad thing about Argentina is they got very little service equipment. In fact, we are bringing in a very large service company's equipment to help us with not just that play, but some other horizontal oil plays also. And it's a very large company that is not housed in the Middle East.
Roger Plank: One thing I still have to sort of pinch myself to think about is we're not getting more for gas and Gas Plus in Argentina than we are in the United States. So it's economically feasible to bring some of these service providers into the country. They need a lot of gas down there.
John Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: That's for sure. I think it's pretty encouraging. Last one for me is the Permian. You mentioned the horizontal wells. How much incremental recovery are you going to get with the program below the water flood fields? And also, be it Wolfcamp shale exposure and how aggressive will you be on that?
G. Farris: Well, the horizontal water flood, I mean, we have proven to ourselves that, that really worked. And if you put little horizontal lines on a map of all the acreage we have in water flood, it would -- you're not in that 7,500 locations that I mentioned in the Permian, which you could put -- punch more in there. So we've got a long way to go with respect to the horizontal in water flood. And it makes at all sense in the world because what most people or all of us have been doing is cycling water into permeable zones. So if you drill a horizontal well in a less permeable but still got a lot of oil in it, because we're drilling less permeable wells in the Eagle Ford and everywhere else and trying to suck oil out of there. But for oil in rich oil places, you just got to get into a little less permeable zone and frac it. And so far it's worked very well, better than our expectations there. In terms of Deadwood and the Wolfcamp, the decline, I'll be real honest with you, sorely disappointed in our first horizontal well there. And I will tell we tried some gee whiz stuffs on the fracs, and we need to go back to drilling it and see if we can get some rigs out of there, because there's a lot of people drilling wells around us that got pretty good rigs and we got 167,000 [ph] acres there. So not it's likely to be -- it could be a big play for us.
John Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: Do you think maybe you're too distal?
G. Farris: I'm sorry?
Daniel Morrison - Global Hunter Securities, LLC: Do you think maybe you're too distal?
G. Farris: Yes, it's possible. I don't think so. Yes, I mean, that's -- like most plays that's -- actually, I don't -- in parts of our acreage, I think because we got people that you and I could name the top 2 right off sentence that are making good wells. Some of this stuff is not rocket science you know what I'm in.
Operator: I will now turn the conference back over to management for any concluding remarks.
Alfonso Leon: Thank you all for your participation. If you have any further questions, you got my number, and I'll be back in my office. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for participating, and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Apache Corp. First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded. Today's presentation will be hosted by Mr. Alfonso Leon, Vice President, Planning Strategy and Investor Relations. Mr. Leon, please go ahead.
Alfonso Leon: Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Apache Corporation's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we reported first quarter 2011 net income of $1.1 billion, or $2.86 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items that impact the comparability of results, also totaled $1.1 billion, or $2.90 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations totaled $2.2 billion. On today's call, we'll have 4 speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions: Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer; Roger Plank, President and Chief Corporate Officer; and Tom Chambers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We've prepared our usual detail supplemental data package for your use, which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or costs incurred. This data package can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financialdata. Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions, and no assurances can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
G. Farris: Thank you, Alfonso, and good afternoon, everyone. As I'm sure all of you are aware, Apache this morning announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2011. During the quarter, we achieved record production of 732,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. We also posted our third highest quarter of earnings ever, as Alfonso pointed out, $1.1 billion, and our second highest cash flow ever of $2.2 billion. The reality is that we faced a number of unexpected external challenges around the world since the beginning of the year: In Australia, we have suffered 6 consecutive cyclones and have had problems with third-party FPSO; there have been some social unrest in Egypt; and like many people, the Permian and central regions closed up during part of February; and then on top of all that, the U.K. government decided to raise taxes in the North Sea. You would think our performance would have suffered, and it did somewhat. But despite the challenges, Apache produced near-record financial results and had broad-based drillbit success with multiple new field discoveries. And Rod Eichler will walk you through some of these in a moment. I'd like to take stock of what drove Apache's performance in the quarter, and it really comes down to a few things: It's really our portfolio strength, our people and our culture. The one thing we've learned as a company over 5 decades, that if you want to make money in the oil and gas business over the long haul and not just now, you need to have a broad-based and well-balanced portfolio of quality assets, and you need to build a culture based on asset focus and returns.  And on the portfolio side, producing 358,000 barrels of liquids a day, 92% of which is crude oil, certainly benefited our results for the quarter, given the high prices. But it's taken, many, many years' discipline and not allowing others or equity market fashions to get us into that position. We produced almost as much crude oil in the Gulf of Mexico shelf as we do in the Permian Basin, and 60% of our oil production is international. These may not have been popular portfolio choices at the time we made them, but today, they underpin our cash flow and our business strength.  On the people and culture side. I'd like to point out we're ahead of plan in nearly every operating metric in Egypt, despite having evacuated many of our expats and the challenges of keeping business running during the social unrest we had there earlier in the year. We didn't slow production, we didn't drop a rig and we didn't even stop shooting seismic. And it's because every single Apache kept their eyes on the ball and went beyond the call of duty to get the job done. I'm happy to report that, predominantly, all our expats are back in Egypt already, and those who are not are on their way. And we have still a big job to do in Egypt, and we're going to get on with it. I could go over many other outstanding examples for the quarter. It's a unique culture we've built over many years and which we are very proud to be a part of. The other issue I'd like to touch on briefly is our capital. Clearly, our cash flow strength is ahead of our capital investment program we authorized earlier in the year, which is about $7.5 billion. And we plan to pay down debt, but I can say we are also evaluating opportunities to put additional capital to work in attractive rate of return opportunities in a number of our regions this year. And we'll have an update of this by our Analyst Day on May 17.  And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Rod for operations highlights.
Rodney Eichler: Thank you, Steve. In the central region, production in the first quarter was down sequentially due to disruptions from unusually cold weather. Apache operated 12 rigs in the region during the quarter and drilled 23 wells, of which 20 were horizontals, with an 87% success rate. There are 3 highlights I'd like to note in the central region for the quarter.  Firstly, we've drilled the first dual lateral well by any company in the Granite Wash. This well targeted 2 different horizontal members of the Granite Wash from a single vertical wellbore. The lower zone was completed at an initial rate of 6 million cubic feet of gas per day and 220 barrels of oil per day. Two months later, the upper zone was completed at an initial rate of 6 million a day and 40 barrels of oil per day. Using this method realized $2 million in cost savings in this first application alone, compared to drilling 2 single horizontal wells. Secondly, we completed the first horizontal test of the Granite Wash C formation [Marmaton C formation], achieving a test rate of 6.8 million cubic feet of gas per day and 180 barrels of condensate per day. And thirdly, in the Cherokee oil play, we completed 2 wells, one for 950 barrels of oil per day at 1.5 million cubic feet of gas per day, and the other for 425 barrels of oil per day and 725 Mcf per day. We intend to drill 20 more Cherokee oil wells this year. And oil drilling, including the Hogshooter zone, represents nearly half of our central region activity. We'll have a greater detail on these plays during our Analyst Day in May. Moving to the Permian. Production was down sequentially due to the impact of extreme cold weather-related freeze-ups compounded by third-party plant outages. The region operated 24 rigs and drilled 110 wells during the quarter, with 15 being horizontal wells. Our current 24 rigs in the Permian represent a nearly 5-fold increase of our activity in the region from a year ago. Horizontal development drilling in 4 water flood units located on the central basin platform has yielded excellent results. 23 horizontals drilled over the last year have increased production 57% to 7,700 barrels of oil per day in a level not seen in a decade. We are completing another 7 wells with anticipated IPs of 250 to 500 barrels of oil per day per well.  Based on these successes, a significant horizontal drilling inventory is building across our central basin platform assets. On the Yeso assets acquired from BP, we are planning to ramp up from 2 rigs now to 5 rigs by year end. Our 4 wells completed there year-to-date are producing 100 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well, and 16 more are awaiting completion. We plan to drill 55 wells this year. At the Wilshire field acquired from BP, 9 wells will be drilled during the second quarter. These initial wells will help appraise the drilling potential at Wilshire, as well as BP's other former core Spraberry properties with the potential to prove up more than 400 drilling locations. At this point, former BP and Mariner assets represent more than 60% of this region's current drilling inventory. Turning to the Gulf of Mexico area. Production in our Gulf of Mexico shelf, deepwater and gulf coast onshore regions was up a combined 8% sequentially. In the Gulf of Mexico shelf, we drilled 13 wells with a 69% success rate. We currently operate 5 rigs and remain on target for our plan to drill 41 wells this year. This plan is about 1/3 less than our desired level of activity, reflecting ongoing constraints in the well purging process. In the Gulf of Mexico deepwater, we achieved first production from 2 projects during the first quarter, representing 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of combined initial production. These were all tie-back projects that didn't require new drilling. During the remainder of the year, we expect first production from 3 small deepwater projects, with combined initial production of 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. On the exploration front, we expect the results of the first production test at Lucius by the operator Anadarko in the second quarter. We continue to build and refine our prospect inventory on our 110 deepwater exploration blocks in anticipation of getting back to drilling for multi-hundred-million barrel oil prospects, hopefully, by next year. In the onshore Gulf Coast, we operated 3 drilling rigs during the first quarter and drilled 14 wells with 86% success rate. Although many of them are still awaiting completion or testing, preliminary economics suggest an overall 25% after-tax rate of return at our planning prices, which are significantly below strip. Turning to Canada. Apache's Canada production was up 7% sequentially. We ran 7 rigs in Canada during the quarter and drilled 61 wells with 95% success rate, and achieved an 18% after-tax rate of return at planned prices. 18 of these wells target oil and EOR projects, 31 targeted liquids-rich gas plays and 12 targeted natural gas. All successful wells generated attractive rates of return, reflecting the depth and richness of Apache's portfolio in Canada. One highlight at this stage is that we have built a multi-year growth inventory at a number of liquids-rich gas plays in which we hold substantial acreage positions. These include the Glauconite, Viking, Cardium, Bluesky and Montney. Liquid yields range between 35 and 80 barrels per million cubic feet, creating compelling economics.  In Egypt, Apache's gross production was up 2% sequentially during the quarter. Oil was up 3% driven by our broad-based drilling, workover, recompletion and water flood successes. Gas was up 0.5% despite planned turnarounds at Apache-operated plants and unplanned third-party downtime. Net production was up 1.2%, which is lower than our gross production growth, primarily due to the impact under our PSCs and higher oil realizations on operator entitlement barrels, which means as our cash flow goes up, we report fewer barrels. We operated 22 rigs during the first quarter and drilled 33 wells with 88% success rate, in addition to drilling 12 ejector wells. 18 exploration wells were drilled with a 78% success rate.  We have made the first new field discovery in our 1.6 million acre Siwa concession, Apache's westernmost concession in Egypt. The Siwa-D1X discovery well test flowed at 4,500 barrels of oil at 8 million cubic feet of gas per day from 75 feet of AEB in Jurassic pay. Apache has a 50% contract of interest in this well. This discovery has opened opportunities both from the Siwa concession and in our adjacent West Kalabsha concession. We intend to drill at least 2 follow-up prospects during 2011. Apache also made what may be the first commercial Paleozoic discovery in Egypt during the quarter. As you may recall, our growth and running room in Egypt has been based on repeatable exploration success in a number of formations going down to the Jurassic. We had not counted on deeper Paleozoic formations until now, but we have worked the concept, and it has paid off with our discovery at Tayim west 1X. Two tests in the Paleozoic had a combined flow rate of 3,600 barrels of oil per day and 1.6 million cubic feet of gas per day. This discovery opens a new play for Apache's Egypt team, and introduces a new component to the attractive multi-pay environment of the Western Desert. Two appraisal wells drilled in the Abu Gharadig south field, acquired from BP in 2010, have increased its potential by extending the depth of logged hydrocarbons by 184 feet on the western flank of the field, and 117 feet on the eastern flank of the field, setting up multiple new well opportunities and a sizable resource to monetize through existing infrastructure. The first 5 wells drilled by Apache at Abu Gharadig complex are expected to produce nearly 7 million barrels of oil equivalent, with many more wells to come. The Abu Gharadig gas plant will soon be at over 80 million cubic feet of gas per day throughput with the completion of the first 4 wells. This is the highest throughput from the Abu Gharadig plant since 2001. The plant was processing just under 48 million cubic feet of gas per day when we acquired it in November. We have used existing infrastructure to add over 30 million cubic feet of gas per day, and new volumes from the first few wells drilled on the block. We currently operate 24 rigs in Egypt, 2 more than in the first quarter, and we plan to drill over 70 exploration wells in 2011, a 50% increase from 2010. In Australia, production was down 8% sequentially, largely due to weather-related shutdowns caused by numerous cyclones and tropical storms during a very active weather season over Northwest Shelf. All Apache's production and processing assets in that region experienced weather downtime during the quarter.  Production at Van Gogh averaged 4,850 net barrels of oil per day during the quarter, up sequentially, but below our plan. Continued downtime and unreliability of the third party-operated FPSO remain a serious concern, and we are working with the operator on a remediation program potentially including shipyard time in 2012. These external difficulties were offset by excellent exploration results. We have been operating 2 rigs in Australia and have reached GD [ph] on 4 wells year-to-date, with 3 successes including 2 notable discoveries. At Zola 1, we've made a significant new fuel discovery with 410 feet of net gas pay in the Mungaroo. Apache is the operator of discovery and has a 30.4% working interest. Importantly, this new deepwater field, 16 kilometers southwest of the giant Gorgon field along the same structural arch, is near existing and future infrastructure. It is too early to discuss resource size, and next steps are to acquire new seismic and drill appraisal wells. Zola was the second prospect drilled as a result of our 40% expansion in Australian exploration acreage last year and follows the Spar-2 success announced in November 2010. At Balnaves Deep, we made a deeper Mungaroo gas pool discovery in the Julimar-Brunello complex, encountering 362 feet of net pay. Further work is required, but our current estimates are in the order of 370 Bcf of gas on a P50 basis, which would bring Julimar-Brunello complex total gas reserves close to 2.5 Tcf on a P50 basis. Apache operates this discovery with a 65% working interest. We have 5 remaining well-kept prospects to drill this year. We are now completing 7 new 3D seismic surveys, covering 1.3 million acres of our new and existing exploration assets, and working with this data to generate and upgrade future prospects will be our focus for the rest of the year.  Our 2 new major development projects entering production this year, the first, Reindeer, Devil Creek and Halyard, remain on target as our teams have worked hard to overcome the weather disruptions. Due to timing of startup and ramp-up profiles, these projects will only contribute about 7 million cubic feet equivalent of gas per day of net production in 2011, but anticipate 67 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day in 2012. And last, the North Sea. Production was down sequentially due to the previously announced Bravo pipeline downtime that will continue through September. At the beginning of March, we implemented a partial restoration of 7,000 barrels of oil per day, as anticipated in our guidance for the year. About 4,500 barrels of oil per day remain offline.  As in other regions, the real news for the quarter is our team's outstanding drilling performance. This is one of our best drilling quarters in the Forties Field in our 7 years as operator. We drilled 5 successful wells with 3 rigs. One of these wells, Charlie 2-2, tested at 11,000 interim barrels of oil per day with no water. This is the best well drilled in the Forties Field in nearly 20 years.  Our technical work was at the heart of this performance. A new time-lapse 4D seismic survey was acquired over Forties during 2010 to identify accumulations of bypassed oil. Charlie 2-2 successfully targeted one such area. Four additional time-lapse targets in the same channel system are scheduled for drilling in 2011, as well as bypassed well targets at other parts of the field. Apache plans to drill a total of 16 wells in Forties in 2011.  The region's development activity continues on target for first production from the Bacchus field in late third quarter, and installation of a Forties alpha satellite platform in third quarter of 2012, which will provide 18 new drilling slots. In the second quarter, planned turnaround will reduce North Sea production by 6,600 net barrels of oil per day, and we expect oil production for the region to be around 55,000 net barrels per day. Lastly, in Argentina. The most significant operational development is our Gas Plus sales, which as of April, have increased to 75 million cubic feet of gas per day with a $4.93 per Mcf average realization, representing a significant volume and price upside over the first quarter. First quarter region production drifted 6% lower as we weighted offtake or readiness for these premium-priced sales volumes, as Gas Plus has been the focus of our development drilling. We currently anticipate second quarter production to be up about 10% sequentially.  We operate 7 rigs in Argentina. Two are drilling Gas Plus wells, one is drilling -- developing shallow oil reservoirs and the remaining 4 are conducting exploration drilling. One of exploration rigs is going to pursue oil targets off of our new 3D in the proven but under-explored Cujo Basin, and 2 are targeting unconventional resources in the Neuquén basin. We expect to complete the first horizontal multi-frac shale well at Argentina in May.  I will now turn the presentation over to Tom Chambers, who will cover the finance area.
Thomas Chambers: Thanks, Rod. And as you've already seen from our press release and heard earlier on this call, we reported earnings of $1.1 billion, or $2.86 per share, for the first quarter. Adjusted for certain items that impact the comparability of results, such as foreign currency fluctuation on deferred taxes and merger acquisition and transition cost, we earned $2.90 a share, up over 30% from the current -- prior quarter. Higher daily production, combined with significantly higher oil prices, increased cash from operations 13% over the fourth quarter to $2.2 billion, our second highest quarter ever, and just the third time we've broken $2 billion per quarter.  As Steve indicated in his opening remarks, our broad-based, balanced portfolio continues to deliver excellent results. Our oil and liquids volumes currently make up 49% of our total production, but account for 77% of our total revenue. More than half our total revenue is generated outside of North America, driven by our portfolio of crude production indexed to Brent Oil price, which is currently running at a $10 premium to WTI, not to mention increasing gas prices in Australia and Argentina. With higher oil prices and oil exposure comes pressure on costs, including drilling and services. However, we were able to hold the line on our costs in the first quarter while expanding our cash and pretax margins by 23% and 37%, respectively, excluding merger, acquisition and transition costs. Cash margins rose over $8.00 per boe to $44.10. And pretax margin, which includes DD&A, rose just under $8.00 of boe to $29.33, which is about 50% margin. You could find the details of these both on the financial supplement located on our website. One cost I would comment further on is gathering and transportation. You would note a significant increase over the fourth quarter 2010. The primary driver of this is Canada, where increased production from Horn River and properties acquired during 2010 at higher average contract rates than Apache's legacy properties. At the end of the quarter, our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 24%, down slightly from 25% at the end of last year. Higher prices and production drove cash on the balance sheet up $222 million to $356 million at the end of the quarter.  Turning to taxes. As you have noted by now the U.K. announced a proposal to increase the rate of the supplementary charge levied on profits from oil and gas production from 20% to 32%. For this increase to take effect it must receive royal assent, which is scheduled for mid-summer. Upon assent, the increase will be retroactive to March 24 of this year, and will result in an increase in our current taxes and a onetime revaluation of our deferred tax liability, impacting earnings for the year by an estimated $300 million to $350 million based on current forecast. Since this rate change has yet to be enacted, our first quarter results do not reflect the increased rate. One last comment on taxes. You will note that our effective tax rate was 41% for the quarter, within our typical range. However, the deferred percentage was particularly low at 19%. The primary reason for this was foreign net operating losses were fully utilized last year, resulting in Apache becoming a current taxpayer in Australia for 2011. We would expect the deferred rate to move back toward the typical mid-30% to 40% range by year end, absent any foreign exchange fluctuations. So to sum up, as the year progresses, we'll continue our focus on costs while growing our production with a strong focus on oil and our longer-term development projects, while continuing to build our balance sheet strength, which is truly a long-term strategic asset. With that, I'll turn it over to Roger.
Roger Plank: Okay, thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Tom talked about the quarter relative to the prior quarter. And I wanted to go back to first quarter a year ago to underscore how significantly our situation has changed, and how that impacts our view and direction going forward.  In a world scrambling for oil, Apache's oil and NGL production was up 57,000 barrels per day, or nearly 20%, with first quarter realization some $20 higher from a year ago. Furthermore, second quarter oil prices have risen another $10 to $15 to date over first quarter levels. Accordingly, we are benefiting from extremely strong earnings and cash flow that enhance our financial flexibility relative to both our competition and to our initial 2011 plan in several ways. First, the growth of our international regions means Apache is a leading beneficiary of today's $10 to $15 per barrel premium of Brent over WTI. Over half our oil production is Brent. Second, as a result, we are building cash balances rapidly, particularly abroad. Apache has now joined the ranks of those profitable U.S. multinationals with growing cash balances outside the U.S. that cannot be brought back tax-efficiently. That limits us from using our rising cash balances to reduce debt, which is predominantly in the U.S., which is why our debt outstanding is flat quarter-on-quarter despite $0.333 billion of cash.  Consequently, we've adjusted our views in the following manner. We have tempered our plans to sell international assets in Canada, and we'll retain some properties earlier earmarked for sale. We now expect Canadian property sales to total something less than $0.5 billion. On the other hand in the United States, where we have the twin objectives of both reducing debt and increasing capital, we are reviewing the possibility of selling some small non-core assets. Looking forward. At strip prices, we now anticipate reducing total debt this year to between $7.5 billion and $7.8 billion while also continuing to build international cash balances. We are also in the process of reviewing for possible increases to our initial capital budget of $7.5 billion, as Steve indicated. Given our robust cash generation and the outlook for oil prices, we are currently evaluating funding initial capital projects. And our focus in evaluating these projects is pretty simple: After-tax rate of return. Additional capital for the year is likely to be concentrated in onshore North America, where it's easiest to deploy it effectively on short notice. Our inventory of projects is deep. And with our expanding cash and financial flexibility, we continue to add to it across our portfolio.  I'll close by quickly mentioning a few of the opportunities we've captured recently. Our central region has gained a 75% working interest in operatorship in 122,000 contiguous acres at the Bivins Ranch in the Texas Panhandle. There are 51 Granite Wash wells immediately to the south in the prolific Panhandle field immediately to the north of this relatively untouched block. In 2010, there was a Granite-Wash-like discovery in the middle of this property that produced over 700 barrels of oil a day, with expected ultimate recovery of 170,000 barrels of oil. We are quite eager to shoot seismic and drill some additional tests at this 122,000 acres. It's very significant in terms of being an addition to our central region's 1 million acres.  Also in the first quarter, our Egyptian region gained a 70% interest in operatorship in the 40,000-acre North Ras Qattara concession. We initially identified 8 prospects, the first of which resulted in a 753 barrel-a-day new field discovery, and a 22 well development in water flood opportunity. In the North Sea, we have contracted a purchase in 11.5% interest in the Nelson Field from a major oil and gas company. This large high-quality oilfield produces approximately 20,000 barrels of oil per day and is immediately adjacent to our Forties Field. The transaction gives us a toehold in this non-operated field, and an opportunity to participate in its later life development. In Argentina, we have entered a fourth exploration basin, the Noroeste basin, by taking 50% of a 500,000-acre block with both conventional and unconventional resource potential. There is new 3D seismic on the block, and we plan to drill wells before year end. Some of you are aware that over the last couple of years, we've been building a "new ventures" effort to look beyond our existing sandboxes, if you will. One example of that is that we have become the largest acreage holder in the Cook Inlet of Alaska, with some 300,000 gross acres. And we intend to explore for large oil prospects there. This opportunity is intriguing, as 3D seismic has been quite limited there. So our immediate focus is acquiring a regional 3D survey to unlock the basin's remaining oil potential. And finally, in East Africa we have contracted for a 50% working interest and operatorship in a 1.2 million-acre block offshore Kenya. Our first well is due to spud in the middle of 2012, and it, too, will target a large structure for oil.  That concludes our prepared remarks. And we'd be happy to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: On the back of some of the successes that you discussed in Egypt, how interested are you in accelerating investment there to develop some of those successes? And do you see any constraints beyond -- or the political constraints, do you see any constraints on the gas processing side?
G. Farris: Well, a whole lot. Rod will really get into the details. This is Steve. But in terms of the -- we're going about it as fast as we can go. I think we're going to spend about $1.1 billion in Egypt this year. And the gas processing is really limited until we get that gas pipeline going south. And I think we made that point when we made the acquisition of BP's assets in Egypt. And I'll let Rod bring you up to date as to where that process is.
Rodney Eichler: Right. Brian, as I mentioned in my remarks, we have increased the gas production in that Abu Gharadig plant that we got from BP, and we're doing some work inside that plant to restore some of the facilities that we've had some -- problems we've had this past quarter. But nonetheless, we anticipate the intelligent pigging, the final pigging evaluation of that 24-inch, 262-kilometer line from Abu Gharadig to Dashour LPG plant, that should take place sometime in the latter part of May. Once we see that, we'll know to what we can re-rate the pipeline to perhaps its original throughput. We have every expectation to be able to bring gas from our Khalda areas along with the gas produced from the Abu Gharadig field area I mentioned, to ramp that up to perhaps the 7,840 million a day if the pipe's in good condition. And so far, everything looks good, from we've seen in initial pigging stages.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And so when we think about, say, the new Paleozoic discovery and the potential for that to open up a new play, is that something that we should think about as having more of a longer-term impact out a few years by just further continuing the same growth trajectory you're on for a longer number of years? Or is that something that could have more of a medium-term or near-term impact?
Rodney Eichler: Well, I think that right now, it appears to be -- it was a structure that we drilled, a similar line of structures based on our 3D like we see in the adjacent parts of the western basin in the Faghur basin area. What's unique about it is it's a Paleozoic reservoir that was charged with oil. And we see many other structures continuing west. It's the frontier part of Egypt there. There are really few wells drilled in this part of Egypt. We're very close to the Libyan border, and this is exciting. This is probably the -- this will the furthest, most westerly production in the country.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Got it, thanks. And then in the U.S., you mentioned you're considering accelerating activity there, can you just talk about the ease that you expect to get additional rigs and frac crews? And do you see any synergies already? Or any gains from scale in places like the Permian, where you now have a bigger position?
Rodney Eichler: Well, we have about 25-rig program operating in the Permian, and the guys are running full out. Of course, there's supplies, services, everything is pretty tight in this kind of high-oil-price environment, but we have everything we need to see us through the year for our program that we have budgeted.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: I guess my question was more along the lines of accelerating from here. I think your indication that you're considering accelerating onshore North America, maybe you could add a little color on where you think that might be, if maybe it's not the Permian, it's the rank out of its tent [ph]?
G. Farris: Well, the prospect inventory opportunities are certainly in the Permian. We a see large inventory of locations. We just only scratching the surface in many of these plays. Well, as you know, the beginning stages of horizontal exploitation in many of these reservoirs that traditionally have been tapped by vertical wells over the last 100 years. We're seeing a lot of very promising results there. I also see continued acceleration and growth in exploitation in our Granite Wash program in Oklahoma and the Panhandle of Texas. We have a substantial inventory of locations to be drilled. So it's just a matter of how much we want to apply to the program to move forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: I'll try 2, one, I think, general, and one also on Egypt, if I may. Just in terms of your capital expenditure and your cash flow, I mean it's pretty obvious what's going on in terms of the relative strength of cash flow. But I'm just curious, what are the operational constraints surrounding your ability to actually spend capital, particularly in the lower 48. I guess what I'm getting at is that it's all very well seeing all the cash flow, but to what extent can you efficiently reinvest that capital?
G. Farris: Well, you're really constrained by [indiscernible]. Physically, the only place we're really constrained in terms of not having services is in the Gulf of Mexico. And the fact of the matter is you can get services for a cost. And the question is what kind of cost you want to pay and what kind of rate of return do you want. Or what kind of rate of return do you want. And also, how do you look at your overall balance sheet. Because it really is a balloon, it's a balance. So we're going to -- it's not rocket science just to figure out we're going to have some more cash and we're going to spend it while we stick to our commitment of paying down some of our debt. But having said that, it's an opportunity-driven thing in terms of rates of return more than anything. I mean, we've got lots of places to spend money, and we're going to spend them in the highest rate of return projects we've got. And right now that's going to be in the Permian Basin for oil and the Granite Wash in the Texas Panhandle.
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: I guess, Steve, what I was kind of trying to get to was in terms of your own internal people, your capability to actually absorb significantly. I mean, what's the limit on the...
G. Farris: You mean organizationally?
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: Yes, right, in terms of your capability to actually absorb more activity levels.
G. Farris: Well, I would tell you probably the biggest -- the Granite Wash, we could absorb, just because that region, if you remember, we split those 2 apart. And we had to rebuild, and we were very damn fortunate because we started rebuilding it before we ever got big in the Permian Basin. We were much smaller when we started that activity. But in terms of limitations of big jumps, and I'm not talking about another 10 rigs, but big jumps in activity in the Permian, it's going to take us a little while. Because we're just going to get the manpower out there. But if you look at where we've come and where we are today in the Permian Basin, I mean we're -- we were running 5 rigs this time last year, we're running 25 right now. We'll be running 25 all year, probably, or more. So that's a big jump.
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: So that's not a factor? In the organizational issues, it's not a factor on maybe why the BP assets haven't seen a lot of activity lately or to date?
G. Farris: You know what, I've got a -- you've got to understand, and I can't say this enough. We're going to take the best prospects we have. And so if they're BP prospects, we know we made a good deal there. I mean it becomes more and more obvious every day, just in the things that we're working on right now. But it also -- we don't have to drill all the wells that we've got on the Permian Basin, BP, in this year. We got a lot of places to spend cap on. It's really the balance of the portfolio, not do we have prospects to look at in BP. I mean, we could put another 25 rigs running today on BP assets, but we're just not going to do that. And hopefully you'll see more on that on May 17. You'll see a broader array of opportunities. It's just a question of which ones we're going to focus on at the current time.
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. I appreciate your answering that, Steve. the more -- I guess, the more detailed question is on Egypt, because clearly, your volumes were up despite a significantly higher oil price. I guess, Rod, what I'm curious on is you've always talked about repeatability of your drilling program out there. Can you just talk about how the 100,000 barrel a day target in light of the success you had, in light of the additional capital, in light of the BP assets, why is that number -- why are we not seeing that number skewed to the high side in terms of over the -- your targets may go there as your activity level moves forward?
Rodney Eichler: We're just at the beginning stages. We're 9 months into the 100,000-barrel deal over 5 years, and the objective is to meet that. And with the BP acquisition of the 602,000 acres, those 3 development leases, we may indeed exceed the 100,000 barrels, and maybe even before the 5 years is up. It's really too early to see large additions. We just began drilling on the BP properties just since November, when we took over operatorship. So it's a little slower. Let's face it, since January 25, things are not the same in Egypt with regard to the government processing of paperwork. It's been almost at a standstill in February and early parts of March. So we've had some slowdowns, though operationally in the field, there's been no material slowdowns. But getting approval for routine things like development leases, it's been slow. But I expect that, that will change as we go forward.
G. Farris: And it is [indiscernible].
Rodney Eichler: Yes. It is, yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Tameron of Wells Fargo.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Can you just give us a little more color on the Cook Inlet, what you're doing up there, what you're chasing? Just a little more color than what you talked about.
Rodney Eichler: Well, it's principally an exploration play in what had been considered to be a mature province. The one thing we've done is there's a lack of any regional coverage of any kind of a modern 3D seismic program, which really, in our experience, makes a big difference in your opportunities to drill successfully. It's a very robust petroleum system, a lot of oil in place. A lot of areas have not been covered by seismic, nor the existing seismic is suitable for modern-day prospecting purposes. And we have, of course, with the early stages of all this activity, but that was kind of the concept we went to this area.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: All right. Moving over to the Granite Wash. You talked about $2 million cost savings on that dual lateral. Can you tell us what your cost was, and if you're planning on doing more of this going forward?
Rodney Eichler: That's about a -- on that first example, that's about a 12% to 15% cost savings of a dual lateral versus 2 single lateral horizontal wells. In that area, those costs run about $9.5 million for a single lateral. That's for, like, a 4,000-foot lateral.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay, all right. And then going forward, is this a one-off, or is this something you plan putting on the development program? Or how -- can you talk about, going forward, what your plans are?
Rodney Eichler: This was, clearly, is the first time it's ever been done by anybody. This was clearly a test of concept. As you know, there are many stacked washes in this part of the Anadarko Basin, and we have every intention of expanding the technique and trying it in other areas, different zones. So it's just the beginning for us, first well.
G. Farris: And it's not much different. We've got pad drilling in our Horn River with the frac manifold we've come up with to be able to do that in a -- really, for a smaller area and do more things. And I will tell you, the same thing's going to happen with -- in the United States, with dual laterals. And one of these days, you'll probably have quad laterals just because of the cost versus the space that you have to take up. I mean, it's much more efficient. It's just you've got to learn how to do it. And this was our first one, and it turned out to be pretty successful.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: All right. And then one more. Australia, you kind of alluded to it with Van Gogh. Can you talk about the FPSO and some -- kind of how you see that playing out in the next couple of quarters?
Rodney Eichler: As you know, In the fourth quarter of 2010, we had some difficulty with the turret mooring seals, and subsequently, with the mooring anchoring system, that came as result of a routine inspection. We've made temporary corrections at both of those. And in fact, the field presently is -- the gross production there runs about 27,000 to 30,000 barrels of oil per day. But it's still less than our 40,000 to 42,000 barrels a day that, that field was producing when we went offline for those initial repairs back in the October-November time frame. Going forward, our plan is to work with the operator of the vessel to fully restore the production that we had achieved previously by making some additional repairs to the previously referenced turret mooring seals. And that may indeed involve some dry dock time for this vessel to effect the appropriate level of repairs sometime in 2012. And our initial estimates is it could be -- that could be as much as much as 4 months of downtime, based on our current engineering evaluation.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. And then it sounds like you said 2012 issue with 4 months of downtime, is that right? Is that what I heard?
Rodney Eichler: That's correct. Possibly, yes.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: All right. And so is the implication it runs at that -- if it's going to run a lower rate the rest of this year until you make the assessment?
Rodney Eichler: We just have a few points on the curve that we'd like to -- our target is to get up to the 40,000 range, gross. I think if we can achieve a consistent rate at 30,000 with less mechanical problems, we'll certainly be happy with that as the interim product. But we'd like to factor fully.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Polak of Scotia Capital.
Mark Polak - Scotia Capital Inc.: A question for you on the acquisition of the interest in the Nelson Field. You guys have stayed pretty busy around Forties there with the Maule and Bacchus discoveries, and now this. Do you see further opportunities to consolidate that Nelson Field? And are there any synergies given the proximity to Forties for you?
Rodney Eichler: Yes. We've had our eye on the Nelson Field for many years now. It's literally adjacent, a mirror image to the Forties complex just to the southeast. Very close, I mean, you could see their platforms from our platforms. It's a natural fit to our program. Same depositional channel system that goes from Forties. A little bit lesser quality in the reservoir rock compared to what we have in the Forties, but nonetheless, it's an attractive field. Really, we'll have a 10% non-operating interest, but this gets us in the door. And I think we will have a lot to contribute and suggest to improve the general operations and how to approach cost savings and so forth going forward, and perhaps give us the opportunity to gain additional interest in the field, to preferential rights in the future.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of RBC.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Just sticking with the North Sea for a second there. What did that interest in that Nelson Field cost you guys?
Rodney Eichler: Well, we haven't -- everything's not -- the deal has not closed quite this yet at time -- I'd say at this time.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. So I take as that I expect you to close in the next couple of months? Just wondering if there's any type of time horizon on that?
Rodney Eichler: Yes. We're waiting on a final governmental approval, which we expect to receive imminently. I think the closing will take place sometime in the next 10 days.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay, I understand. I guess in the Granite Wash, you guys mentioned picking up this pretty sizable ranch here, Bivins Ranch. That it was around 122,000 acres. I thought that was your comment there. Do you guys operate that? And what's your working interest on that? I'm trying to get a sense on how much you paid for that.
Rodney Eichler: We will operate the entire 122,000 acres, the seismic, as well as the drilling. We have a 75% working interest in the operations.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. And what did you guys pay for that?
Rodney Eichler: We're not disclosing our price per acre on our land transactions. We have competitors in the area.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. And do you guys expect to potentially pick up more acreage in the Granite Wash as well, I guess?
Rodney Eichler: Yes, we're continuing to try to add to our position at Granite Wash, both in Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. Switching topics over to kind of the LNG side. Any progress that you guys have made on contracts there, whether or not it's Kitimat or Australia, that you guys can share with us?
Rodney Eichler: Yes, I'll turn it over to Janine McArdle, who's our President of Kitimat LNG and Head of our LNG Gas Monetization.
Janine McArdle: In Australia, on our Wheatstone project, we're continuing to finalize our sales and purchase agreement with the buyers that we initially announced with HOA. And under Kitimat, we are talking to several different players in advancing those discussions.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond of Simmons.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company International: Thank you for taking my questions. The first is a follow-up to the previous question on Kitimat. What is the timing that we might hear something on these off-take agreements?
Janine McArdle: We're in discussions right now. We hope over the next several months to make some further announcements. But as you know, these negotiations take a little bit of time. But there is a lot of interest at this moment.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company International: And then switching gears to North American service. What level of service cost inflation are you seeing right now? And in the Permian, for example, as well as in your central region?
G. Farris: Well, it's getting outrageous. [indiscernible] At some point, it's got to stop. Honestly, it's probably up 10%, 15% for the first quarter.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company International: And what were you planning when we went through your budget process on a percentage change year-over-year?
G. Farris: We don't plan. We try to beat them up as much as we can and beat them down.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company International: Okay. And then lastly, switching gears to Egypt. Recently, there was some sabotage on a gas pipeline to Israel. Does that negatively impact you guys?
G. Farris: No. I'll let Rod talk about that. That pipeline has been controversial in Egypt for years, and the gas sales agreement to Israel has been controversial for years. And it has no impact at all on our business. In fact, we have the opportunity to sell more gas, really, if we had it. We just don't have it right now. Rod, do you have a comment?
Rodney Eichler: Well, this is the second explosion or fire on that pipeline in the last 60 days, both of which were probably terrorist acts. This pipeline, in the most recent one, was a metering skid on the line just before the line crosses into the Gaza waters and Ts off, it goes along the Sinai to Jordan. It's on the far east side of country. And all of our production, or gas production, is on the western desert side. It's probably 1,000 kilometers away from this location. All of our gas is sold into the national grid to the government in the west side of the delta. Also perhaps some of our molecules after we fiscalize our gas. The government may take those molecules and put them into that pipeline, but we have no direct association with that gas flow.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company International: Great. And then final question. And, Steve, this is a hard question, but at as it relates to Egypt, I think the former oil minister has been detained in like house arrest or whatnot. When do you think you'll get some clarity on the political situation in Egypt? Is it post these elections coming up in the fall? Or what's sort of your read of the tea leaves right now?
G. Farris: Well, there's not unlike any change in government. The previous government, whether it was ministers or prime ministers -- have to answer to the people that are in power now. That doesn't say they did anything wrong, or they did do something wrong, it's just the fact that they have to answer to them. In terms of our situation in Egypt, frankly, we have probably the best petroleum minister we've ever had, who used to be the Chairman of Khalda, was then the Chairman of EGPC and now the minister of petroleum for Egypt. His name is Abdoul Ghurab, and been in the business for 25 years, worked for GAPCO [ph] , which is the Amico-Lamico [ph]. We really don't find a lot of problems with the ministry, what we -- or even concerns, what we are going to run into here not too long from now is that we're going to have to take things to parliament, because most of these things come under parliamentary agreements for new acreage, for new gas contracts, et cetera, it has to be approved by parliament. The first order of business will, I think is supposed to be in September, they're going to have parliamentary elections, which is historically when they have them anyway. And then the ruling council has indicated that they will have a presidential election by the end of the year. So obviously, both of those are important. Frankly, the parliamentary elections are as important or more important than the presidential elections, at least in terms of having government start getting back to work.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company International: Right. Well, that's very helpful. I appreciate the color there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin of Societe Generale.
John Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: I got a bunch of different questions. In terms to the U.S. CapEx increase, how would you split it between, say, drilling and workover activities? Even or more skewed to drilling?
G. Farris: Yes, because I will tell you generally, workover projects are the highest rate of return projects, and we've become redundant so -- but we're looking for rate of return, and workover recompletions is the highest rate of return projects you can do. So the incremental capital is, pretty much with few exceptions, is all going to be on the drilling side.
Thomas Chambers: Because the workovers would already be embedded in the capital.
G. Farris: Yes. It would already be embedded in the capital.
John Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: Okay, that's fine. With Egypt and the Paleozoic play, what's the aerial extent?
Rodney Eichler: Currently, the extent of the play is unknown because we have this limited number of wellbores poked into it. The initial field also need an appraisal to be drilled, but it appears to be of the same size structure that we have placed our seismic interpretation that we've seen in other parts of the Faghur Basin. It just happens to be -- it appears to be an extension of the Faghur Basin's structural trend in the Siwa concession.
John Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: Okay. With Zola, when will you plan your next delineation well?
Rodney Eichler: We have yet to formulate because we have just moved the rig off there 48 hours ago, so we have not had an opportunity yet with our partners to develop a plan of development going forward. It's hard to say if we'll be able to, on a rig line, to get the first appraisal in, in 2011. Although I'd say more likely, probably in 2012.
G. Farris: I might interject here. The important thing about Zola, I can't -- with Wheatstone and wherever that pipeline is coming down from the Julimar-Brunello, if you could look at a map, and it came back down to the western edge of Australia, we really have a real potential to be able to drill a lot of gas wells and take a lot of gas out of there for a long period of time now, where before we got into Wheatstone, we really didn't have that avenue. So the size of the field itself, or the discovery itself, it's a big synergy, all of that together.
John Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: Okay. With Horn river -- thanks, Steve. With Horn River, my next question, given the higher likely breakeven thresholds in terms of the infrastructure, you got liquefaction, the pipeline, et cetera, would you give up an equity stake in production to the purchasers like you're seeing with other deals?
G. Farris: Well, I think what you're seeing around the world is that the LNG buyers, whether it be TEPCO or KOGAS or the Chinese companies or the Malaysians, all of them like to have the integration of the upstream and downstream. And the upstream portion is much smaller than the offtake. But in terms of actually being in it, yes, I would anticipate in the end that, that this would have to be a wraparound in a deal like this, just like it is in Wheatstone.
John Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: Okay. With the Cook Inlet, is this going to be an AVO [ph] gain?
G. Farris: Is what?
Rodney Eichler: I don't believe so. I think it's principally going to be the delineation of some very large untested structures that we currently see on some of the existing seismic.
G. Farris: If we look at a craning curves for reserves, and this is part of our New Ventures group, the information that they've put in the model when they were talking about whether should we be in the Cook Inlet, if you look at what happened to the wells in the Cook Inlet, they reduced significantly after Prudhoe Bay was found. And as soon as Prudhoe Bay was found, the number of wells drilled and the discoveries in Cook Inlet -- and our philosophy is, because there's very, very little 3D seismic sets over -- an old 3D, even at that, the existing fields that are there, is that people started -- they looked north toward Prudhoe Bay and started looking for bigger reserves up there. Honestly, I'm very excited about it. I mean, we haven't drilled a well there yet we got 300,00 acres, and we're getting ready to shoot some seismic. But it's got some real potential. It's a fun place to look.
John Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: Okay. Just last one for me. With the Granite Wash, are we talking about staggered co-mingled wells in terms of the completions? It sounded like you did once, then you wait a while, then you did the other? Or is this something you can bring on simultaneously in terms of the co-mingling?
G. Farris: No, you complete one, and draw down a little bit, and then come back. Do you mean in terms of the 2 zones together?
John Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research: Right, exactly.
G. Farris: I mean, you will eventually co-mingle. I know it's just rehab now, but you take a little bit of time, and co-mingle and put them together.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Morrison of Global Hunter.
Daniel Morrison - Global Hunter Securities, LLC: A quick follow-up on the dual laterals in the Granite Wash, do you have any specific plans to try that in the Permian this year?
Rodney Eichler: Probably not in the Permian this year. The Permian is at a much less advanced stage of horizontal exploitation compared to what we see in Oklahoma and in Texas the last couple of years, the Granite Wash. There, we still have a lot of vertical drilling, and we're beginning to pick -- it's the start of just drilling horizontal wells in some of these conventional reservoirs. So it's entirely possible. The geology is not exactly the same, but it could lend itself to an application in some parts of the basin in the future.
Daniel Morrison - Global Hunter Securities, LLC: And in the Permian still, could you kind of rank the different plays you're chasing, or talk a little bit about allocation of capital? You said you were cranking up activity in the Yeso, but could you kind of work through some of the other plays that you're active in there?
Rodney Eichler: Well, we're currently -- we have a very active horizontal drilling program on the central basin platform, and it's largely some of our old water flood units, like Lovelland [ph], Backalloy [ph] and Slaughter [ph] TXL-SU. We also have a CO2 program and a Roberts unit [ph] . We have a program in Southeast New Mexico in the Munoz [ph] area, in the Drikard [ph], and of course the vertical program in the Midland Basin and our Yeso program on the outside, the west side of Midland Basin there the Empire/Yeso and Empire/Adlo [ph] units, or attacking Adlo, Yeso and Wolfbury. And of course, in the Midland Basin, our Deadwood program. So those are the principal areas we're active at the present time with our 23 rigs.
Daniel Morrison - Global Hunter Securities, LLC: I think half of those rigs run, aren't they running in Deadwood? So that's probably...
Rodney Eichler: Yes, probably even more than half. Just eyeballing the list.
Daniel Morrison - Global Hunter Securities, LLC: So that's a big area for us?
Alfonso Leon: And we'll do a play-by-play walkthrough on our Analyst Day on May 17.
Daniel Morrison - Global Hunter Securities, LLC: Great, thanks. Deadwood's a Wolfbury [ph] project?
Rodney Eichler: Yes, and first tusselman [ph].
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tony Montana of Diversified Capital. [Technical Difficulty]
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
Alfonso Leon: Okay. Everybody, thank you very much for listening to the call. If you have follow-up questions, you know where to find us.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Apache Fourth Quarter Year End 2010 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's presentation will be hosted by Mr. Alfonso Leon, Vice President of Planning, Strategy and Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Leon, you may begin your conference.
Alfonso Leon: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we reported 2010 net income of $3 billion or $8.46 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $3.2 billion or $8.94 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations totaled $7.4 billion. On today's call, we'll have five speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will lead off; followed by John Crum, Co-Chief Operating Officer and President of North America; Rod Eichler, Co-Chief Operating Officer and President of International; Roger Plank, our President; and Tom Chambers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We prepared our usual detailed supplemental data package for your use, which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or costs incurred. This data package can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financialdata. Today's discussions may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions, and no assurances can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
G. Farris: Thank you, Alfonso, and thank you, everybody for joining us this afternoon. All of you, I'm sure, have read this morning that Apache announced record production of 658,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day for 2010. That is a 13% growth from the previous year. As Alfonso pointed out, we had record annual earnings of $3 billion, and we also ended the year with record proved reserves of around 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. So under any metrics, Apache had an outstanding 2010. We delivered major growth oil projects, including Van Gogh and Pyrenees in Australia and the Kalabsha oil facility in the Western Desert. We advanced our global gas resource monetization strategy through the agreement of an oil-linked OPEC agreement for our Julimar Field via Wheatstone LNG and are becoming majority-owned investors of Kitimat LNG project in Canada. And we took some opportunistic portfolio steps that made us even stronger than the portfolio we started off with at the beginning of the year. In the Permian, we more than doubled our footprint to over 3 million gross acres spanning every play in the basin. In Canada, we gained high-quality properties at an entry price based on low gas prices. In Egypt, we have secured a second major export route for natural gas out of the Western Desert, which should enhance our growth prospects there. And in the Gulf of Mexico shelf, we reloaded our inventory with a new underworked property set from Devon and Mariner. And last but not least, we gained a new long-term growth business in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Now those are just some of the highlights. There's much more on a day-to-day basis going on that creates value for us, and John and Rob will walk through that in a moment. But the short answer is, we're looking at an opportunity set for many years to come like none we've ever had. We are organizing an Analyst Day for May 17 in which we will outline in more detail what this updated opportunity set looks like. Before I turn to 2011, I'd like to provide you a little color, update on our Egyptian operations. The most important item is that all Apache's staff and families are safe. I’d like everyone to understand that Apache has not experienced any production interruption as a result of the developments in Egypt during the recent weeks. And following the advice of U.S. State Department two weeks ago, we redeployed all nonessential expatriate personnel and all expatriate dependents from Egypt. We have created an Egypt floor in Houston and activity is going on as usual. I might add that the general situation in Egypt has improved markedly over the last week. About 1/3 of our expat personnel are already back in Egypt, including most of our field staff. We continue to monitor events closely, and we'll take additional steps if necessary to ensure the continued safety of our staff in operations. I'd like to turn now to our plans for 2011. For 2011, it's going to be a very strong growth year for Apache. We're going to consolidate around our larger opportunity set, and we're building a balance sheet strength as we go into the year. So presently, we've authorized $7.5 billion of capital expenditures for 2011, which is significantly less than our anticipated cash flow for the year based on strip prices. Apache's balance sheet strength and flexibility is an important strategic asset, and we want to ensure we continue to build them for 2011. And so we deliberately established an initial capital budget that will enable us to reduce debt even if prices decline from today's strip. And as been our custom over the years, we will review capital expenditures and should strip prices hold or rise, we'd expect the increased capital later this year. We intend to supplement our debt reduction efforts by pursuing approximately $1 billion of property sales in 2011. These are most likely going to come from our legacy conventional properties in Canada. With the BP transaction, we have an opportunity to high grade and right-size our portfolio up there. We're going to continue to invest in future growth projects. Nearly a third of our 2011 capital program is going to projects which contribute no production in 2011 but will result in later years’ production, which ensures our continued long-term profitable growth. With this capital program, we expect to deliver in 2011 strong double-digit production growth of between 13% and 17% over 2010. Now, I want to point out this excludes any impact from potential acquisitions or divestitures. Our acquisitions in 2010 will, obviously be an important growth driver in 2011. This is purely a function on our capital allocation. Over the last two years, we have invested $8 billion in addition to oil and gas properties, including future growth projects and over $12 billion in acquisitions. If we had allocated that $12 billion of spending capacity into drilling instead, our growth for 2011 would come from that drilling capital. As all of you, I know, are aware, we are a rate-of-return-driven company, and every year we channel our resources into the projects that provide the best returns and long-term growth for our shareholders. I might add that looking beyond 2011, what was a deep opportunity set has become significantly deeper. Our regions have looked beyond now in 2015, and they currently have identified inventory to grow production from 6% to 12% per year with a track to get economics that are [indiscernible] (0:19:38) best assumptions. And I want to make it clear that that's not necessarily what we are going to do. That means we have an opportunity set to do that. Every year, we adjust our plans to give our shareholders the most attractive returns on a long-term growth basis. And we'll outline some of this inventory in our May Analyst Day. The true picture is that our growth in 2011 and beyond is only limited by how much money we spend. We're only scratching the surface of our opportunity set. In the 1.7 million gross acres of BP Permian business, we're starting to get an update to build the real inventory. In other parts of the portfolio, such as the Gulf of Mexico, we don't have a clear picture of what our capital spending will be given the regulatory process uncertainty. I'm sure we will learn more as the year progresses, and we intend to put a new plan together halfway through the year to ensure we fund the best opportunities. We may also release additional drilling capital depending on commodity prices and our balance sheet risk. As most of you are aware, this really isn't unusual for us. Historically, we have allocated capital to our regions on a quarterly basis in any event. I'll finally note that we have always been and will remain opportunistic a company. We don't have any BP-sized transactions on the horizon, but we are seeing more of the quality assets we like. We never plan for acquisitions, and we will capture those opportunities if and when they make sense based on our experience. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to John Crum.
John Crum: Thank you, Steve. North American production in the fourth quarter was up 26% sequentially. The main positive drivers were the consolidation of acquisitions in the Granite Wash development. The negatives were primarily associated with the ongoing permitting issues in the Gulf of Mexico. With that in mind, I will start with the Gulf of Mexico shelf. For perspective, in 2008, we drilled 62 gross wells in the Gulf of Mexico shelf. In 2009, we drilled 20 wells due to low product prices and the result in corporate capital curtailment. Consequently, we started 2010 with an especially strong 59-well inventory on Apache properties alone. That would be excluding the Devon and Mariner acquisition properties we got last year. Due to the moratorium and the permitting process delay, we were only able to drill 36, including the Devon properties. Similar restrictions affected the Mariner assets. With ongoing uncertainty around the permitting process, we cannot assume a normal year and as a result, we are planning 41 gross wells on the shelf, including Mariner and Devon properties. In spite of this, we anticipate region production to grow moderately in the 3% to 5% range in 2011 with a full year contribution of the 2010 acquisitions. The Gulf of Mexico shelf remains an attractive rate of return business and a big cash flow generator for Apache. The silver lining of two years of reduced activity is that when we get back to work at full pace, we will have a very robust pent-up inventory of drilling opportunities. With the Mariner acquisition we have formed a new deepwater region and are excited about its contribution potential to Apache's long-term growth. Mariner's deepwater team constitutes the core of the new regional organization, and we know Apache will benefit from their know-how and track record of project delivery. Our deepwater region brought on stream its first Apache project in late December. The Balboa field was developed through a 6-mile subsea tie back to the existing infrastructure with initial production of 6,500 barrels equivalent per day gross. Apache operates with a 50% working interest. During 2011, we expect four other tie back projects to come on stream at Bushwood, Wide Berth, Mandy and Ewing Bank 998. We expect 2011 deepwater production to average over 15,000 barrels per day subject to any regulatory delays. Looking beyond 2011, we have an attractive pipeline of deepwater development projects, including the world-class discoveries at Lucius and Heidelberg. We also have a broad exploration portfolio across 110 blocks. While we have moderate expectations until there is greater regulatory clarity, the potential for Apache to build a meaningful business in the deepwater is significant. We have also created a new region to focus on our Gulf Coast onshore assets where we control over 700,000 acres, including almost 300,000 acres in South Louisiana where we own the minerals. We believe the opportunities for growth onshore warrant having a dedicated organization and based on our recent experience in the Permian, since it was created as a focus region, we expect great things from our Gulf Coast onshore team. In 2011, we currently forecast strong single-digit growth for the Gulf Coast onshore region. Moving to the central region, we will keep about 12 rigs running all year long with more than 95% of those drilling horizontally. The Granite Wash play will remain a strong growth driver in 2011 where we will keep at least eight horizontal rigs busy during the year. We expect to drill 40 gross horizontal Granite Wash wells and achieve production growth of over 10% in 2011. During 2010, the central transition from vertical to horizontal well is almost completed. We control over 1 million acres primarily in Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, which means that as new horizontal drilling plays emerge, the central region has a footprint to make those new opportunities material to Apache's growth. Moving to the Permian. We now own over 3 million gross acres with exposure to every play in the Permian basin. The BP and Mariner transactions enabled us to more than double our footprint from last year, given the excitement about the potential of the base and frankly, [indiscernible] (0:25:58.3) releasing our asset options. We are currently running 23 rigs in the Permian and plan to remain above 20 all year long, while drilling 368 wells for the year. Mariner's Deadwood assets will be the largest component of this activity. Our acreage is subject to continuous drilling process, so we are now running 11 rigs and will average 10 for the remainder of the year drilling 130 wells. We are primarily drilling vertical wells for Wolfcamp, which can enhance when we find possible strong play in the same wellbore. We are developing the acreage with vertical wells costing around $1.8 million. The typical IP is 125 barrels equivalent per day and produce EURs in the 150,000 boe's ultimate recovery with over 75% of that being liquids. These wells deliver rates of return well above 20% at plant prices, which are currently significantly [indiscernible] (0:27:04.3). We have already identified 800 locations in this asset alone, and that is before we include any horizontal prospectivity, which we are just now starting to evaluate. We hold 85,000 gross acres or 63,000 net. It's a great asset. The second largest component is our joint venture with Concho and the Empire/Yeso, where we're now running two rigs and we'll drill 55 wells this year. We have identified over 600 locations already. We expect these wells to be lower cost and generate higher rates of return than Deadwood. In 2010, we also had good results drilling horizontals in four different old water plants and continue to learn more about the potential for horizontals in the Permian basin. In 2011, we will drill 41 horizontal wells across a number of our assets. The Empire/Yeso area is the first phase of BP's 1.7 million gross acres that we acquired, where we will have a new regional project. We are currently working through an integration plan which will be completed by midyear. We are confident that we will generate numerous other project opportunities on those BP properties. As Steve noted, we're only starting to scratch the surface on our Permian opportunity set. We're in the early steps of evaluating horizontal potential in the basin and still are getting our arms around the entire BP opportunity set. We've gone from five operated rigs at this time last year to over 20 today. Half of those are operating on the Deadwood asset, which represents less than 4% of our acreage. We believe the Permian results will purely be a function of how much money we want to spend and how we pace ourselves. Outside the Mariner Deadwood position, almost all of our acreage is held by production, so we can develop at whatever pace is appropriate. We have conservatively identified over 5,000 locations and are poised to double our activity level over the next several years. With over 3 million gross acre spending every [indiscernible] (0:29:13.2) it's easy to see why we're excited about our Permian position. All in, we're currently forecasting a moderate single-digit growth in the Permian from fourth quarter 2010 to the 2011 average. But again, that will be a function of how we decide to change the pace as we integrate the BP assets. I should note that during the first half of February, we have experienced significant freeze offs in the area due to the unusual weather conditions, it's going to have a significant impact on first quarter's production somewhere in the range of 4,000 barrels per day for the quarter. Finally, in Canada during 2011, we're going to take advantage of our broad opportunity set and we will run two to three rigs each in our oil, EOR and liquid-rich West 5 and Kaybob areas and in exploration. In addition, we will have two-plus rigs running in the Horn River and Noel areas for a total of 10 rigs running during the drilling months. We expect Canada production for 2011 to grow in the strong single-digit range from fourth quarter 2010 levels. Our Noel tight gas project in the Montney area ramped up to 100 million a day by the end of the fourth quarter. 14 wells are drilled in 2010 with continued development of locations in the Cadomin & Doig formations. This activity will continue in 2011 with 11 more wells. The team's ability to optimize cost by moving to multilateral and pad development will make Noel a profitable project even at current gas prices. We have 75 additional locations identified in the Cadomin & Doig. The Horn River development will continue as wells drilled in prior years are completed. In addition, our partner in Cadomin will drill 1/2 of the pad this next year or in 2011. Kitimat LNG continues to move forward. Front-end engineering and design is underway. Last week, we, and our partner EOG announced [indiscernible] (0:31:20.2) to gain full ownership and control of the 287-mile pipeline, which will link the Canadian grid to the export facility. We are currently in OPEC discussions with several Asia-Pacific LNG buyers. We are targeting an investment decision by the end of the year and would expect to commence exports of 700 million feet of gas per day in late 2015, with significant expansion potential. Apache owns 51% of this project. We continue to advance other material lead plays in Canada, and we will comment on them at the right time over the coming quarters. I will conclude North American highlights by noting, in Canada's joint venture with PetroChina this last week, which would imply a value for our Canadian portfolio of over $20 billion based on reserve ratios. Combining the value of our Permian basin based on the Permian company valuations, this would imply that these two North American regions [indiscernible] (0:32:24.5) over 80% of Apache's entire current enterprise value. Now I'll turn it over to Rod Eichler for international.
Rodney Eichler: Thank you, John. International production volumes in the fourth quarter were down 5% sequentially driven by facility outages in Australia and the North Sea. In Australia, Van Gogh was impacted by essential maintenance activities on the FPSO turret swivels and turret mooring system. Net fourth quarter production of 6,100 barrels of oil per day was down 17,600 barrels a day from the third quarter. Production resumed on February 7 and was 21,000 net barrels of oil per day earlier this week. Production has been temporarily shut down since last night due to proximity of Cyclone Dianne. We expect production to decline naturally during 2011 as originally planned. Pyrenees project fourth quarter production was 27,000 net barrels of oil per day achieving project pay up in December. Some of the wells at Pyrenees have also been shut in due to the Cyclone Dianne. The project is expected to experience potential decline phase during 2011. With plant decline in these two projects and modest contribution from future development projects, we expect average Australia production to decline in the low-teens in 2011. However, we expect strong production growth to resume in Australia in 2012 as other development projects come on stream. To summarize their sequencing, Halyard and Reindeer are expected on stream within 2011 by achieving full contribution in 2012. Coniston and Macedon are expected on stream in 2013. Balnaves in 2014 and Julimar, Wheatstone LNG in 2016. This project pipeline represents incremental volumes net to Apache of 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2012, 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2013 and 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2014. And that is before Wheatstone brings an additional 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016. All of these projects remain on track toward their first production [indiscernible]. Last week, our board sanctioned the development of the Coniston oil field, which will be tied back to Van Gogh FPSO and will expand the economic life of the Van Gogh production. First production at Coniston is expected in 2013 with an average 7,100 barrels of oil per day net to Apache. The Julimar and Wheatstone LNG project continues to advance toward final investment decision expected in second half 2011 as Apache or its partners have entered agreements with LNG buyers representing nearly 80% of the project's production. The Carnarvon Basin offshore in Western Australia is about the same size as the Gulf of Mexico [Audio Gap] but less than 10% of the wells in the Gulf of Mexico today. We have achieved continued exploration and discoveries in the Carnarvon for many years, which we have transformed into a pipeline of large development projects for Apache. During 2010, we expanded our exploration footprint there by 44% via farm-ins to seven permits, representing 2.7 million gross acres. Apache will operate all of these with a 30% to 75% working interest. In 2011, we will take the first step to unlocking the resource potentials in large portfolio to the acquisition of 1.3 million acres of 3D seismic and the drilling of Southern wildcat wells. Turning to Egypt. The region achieved a new production record of 374,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day in November. We currently have 23 drilling rigs running in Egypt, and assuming normal operating conditions, we expect to maintain this level of activity to deliver moderate single-digit production growth for the year, while we advance important growth projects, including the upgrading and looping of the Salam to Abu Gharadig to Dashour pipelines and sanctioning of the Salam gas plant 5. Asset integrity testing on existing southern pipelines and acquired BP processing facilities are underway, and upstream projects are nearing completion to deliver additional gas to Egyptian market via this new second export route for Apache the first gas during first quarter 2011. We plan an active exploration here in Egypt with 65 gross exploration wells, an increase of [indiscernible] from 2010. We will also drill our first horizontal wells in the Western Desert. In addition, during first quarter, we will complete processing of a new 3D over the Abu Gharadig concession we had acquired from BP, which had not a new 3D in over a decade, in spite of its location at the heart of one of the most prolific areas of the Western Desert. Moving to the North Sea. Fourth quarter production was affected by downtime related to well workovers. While this is behind us, first quarter production has been reduced by 11,600 barrels per day outage of the Forties Bravo to Charlie pipeline. About half this daily production will be restored in March via a temporary repair with full production restoration set for September upon installation of the replacement pipeline. Due to this downtime, we currently expect North Sea production for 2011 to be nearly 10% below 2010 levels. Nevertheless, Forties remains one of the best investments ever made by Apache, and holds large remaining opportunities for us. During 2011, we will advance our ability to realize these opportunities through the fabrication of the Forties Alpha satellite platform which will be installed in 2012 to give us additional drilling spots. We will also begin production from the Bacchus field during the fourth quarter 2011 as a tie back to the Forties alpha platform. We plan a 16-well Forties drilling campaign in 2011, which will benefit from the new Forties survey that has already improved our ability to identify and target pockets of unswept oil. This new Forties recently led us to redirect an Echo target and identify two Charlie drilling locations with very successful results. One of these Charlie wells has been tested at 3,300 barrels of oil per day. We expanded our footprint in the North Sea with successful bid for four exploration licenses in the highly competitive 26 licensing round, in addition to farming in to the Siegel [ph] and Siegel North [ph] licenses with a 50% working interest. The Siegel [ph] licenses operated by Talisman only estimated 44 million barrels on discovery. Finally in Argentina, as of April, we expect our gas plus sales to increase from 10 million cubic feet of gas per day [indiscernible] price of $4.10 per million BTU to 63 million cubic feet of gas per day or the equivalent nearly of 1/3 of our fourth quarter gas production in the country at a weighted average price of $4.84 per million BTU. This is an important step forward for us and supports our strategy of drilling for gas in places that are short of gas. We plan to run six drilling rigs in Argentina during in 2011. Three of the four development rigs will focus on gas test run drilling, and two rigs will drill exploration wells. We currently expect Argentina production to grow by more than 10% in 2011. During 2010, we grew via bid round licensing and farm-ins to 1.7 million gross acres on new condition shale gas fairway. This represents 944,000 net acres. A number of major international groups have recently stopped to enter this play and we were able to capitalize on our existing position in the basin and our partnership with YPF to secure an early shale acreage position, which we believe is second only to YPF's. We are currently drilling the [indiscernible] shale well in South America in the Neuquén Basin. We expect to reach target depth in March but we'll complete the well in April due to equipment availability limitations. We will be able to sell production from this well for $5 per million BTU under one of our existing gas plus contracts. That concludes the international highlights, and I'll now turn it over to Roger Plank.
Roger Plank: Thanks, Rod, and good afternoon, everyone. We've got a long line of speakers today. So I'm just going to underscore a couple of quick points about Apache's competitive position before our new CFO, Tom Chambers, finishes up with the numbers. The first point is that we are in an ideal operating environment for Apache. Low North American gas prices and high oil prices mean many gas-weighted competitors are struggling to make ends meet, while Apache turns in record financial results. A related point is, that while we have dialed back our initial 2011 capital budget, we are doing it to ensure that we reload our firepower, not because we are pessimistic about the [indiscernible] purposes and specifically oil prices. Frankly, with less than 1/5 of our revenues emanating from North American natural gas, gas prices could literally fall in half and the impact would be relatively insignificant to our overall portfolio. So the real issue for Apache is oil. And there we think the fundamentals are very strong. You are, no doubt, aware that WTI presently trades around $85 per barrel or about $5 higher than last year's average. You may not be aware that Brent is trading at over $100 a barrel or $20 higher than last year's average. That is very good news for Apache as well over half our oil production is priced-off Brent. My point is that things are lining up for what could very well prove to be a banner year for Apache. With oil prices strong and double-digit production growth, we're well positioned, not only to bolster our balance sheet, but also to be in a position to release more capital should current conditions remain. Precisely at a time when opportunities are abundant and the competition is struggling. That's an ideal environment for Apache to continue to execute our profitable growth strategy. Tom?
Thomas Chambers: Thanks, Roger. Good afternoon, everyone. One more time, I'd like to reiterate that we earned a record of $3 billion in earnings or $8.46 a share for 2010. It's a great number, and I'd like to reiterate it. When we adjust for the items that impact the comparability of those results, we earn $3.2 billion, $8.94 a share, which is up nearly 70% from the prior year's $1.9 billion. Record production combined with higher oil prices drove cash from operations up 48% over 2010 to $7.4 billion for the year and just shy of $2 billion for the quarter. This speaks volumes for our balanced portfolio, and we've been able to benefit substantially from higher oil realizations and the fact that oil currently sells for over 20x the price of North American gas. Oil and liquids accounted for 77% of our revenues in 2010 that represent just over half our production. Oil alone accounted for 49% of total 2010 production. Our oil portfolio offers another unique feature when it comes to price, as Roger just mentioned. Almost 60% of our total production, which encompasses all of our international oil production, with the exception of Argentina, is sold against the Brent index. Brent is currently running at a significant premium over $15 a barrel to WTI versus the traditional discount. Therefore, we are well positioned to benefit from this pricing situation. In addition to that, U.S., LLS and HLS crude rates are selling at double-digit premiums to WTI. Over 30% of our total U.S. volumes are sold against these indices giving us an additional revenue benefit from our U.S. oil volumes. Our higher oil exposure also impacts operating costs. Cash costs, excluding taxes other than income and merger and transition costs, averaged $11.73 per boe in 2010, up about $0.50 per barrel compared to 2009. Our goal was to keep 2010 cash costs flat with last year, but we ended up 4% higher influenced by the impact of rising oil prices on costs. Recurring DD&A was also up from the prior levels as you might expect, given the significant level of acquisitions in the year. Turning to reserves. We replaced current production through drilling by adding 245 million barrels of oil equivalent and proved reserves during 2010. Including acquisitions, sales and revisions we replaced 344% of production. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on the fourth quarter since it was pretty noisy due to acquisition timing, change in the mix of the properties due to the acquisitions and operational issues and as you've, no doubt, noted, the financial results bear that out. From a production perspective, the fourth quarter rate of 729,000 barrels equivalent a day was our best quarter ever. Unit costs were up for the quarter because of the combination of plan production downtime, onetime transaction costs and bringing in to our portfolio higher unit cost of properties from acquisitions. Now we'll get to work, and coupled with restoring production, we expect our capital cash cost to come back in line and dropping throughout the year to exit the year at around the average of 2010 or around $11.75 per boe, which excludes taxes other than income. We would be remiss if we didn't talk about our hedging program, including hedges assumed from Mariner. For 2011, we have approximately 120,000 barrels of oil per day hedged. Most of our positions were entered using collar arrangements with floors just above $69 and ceilings of around $97. In total, we've hedged around a third of our oil production. We've not entered into any new gas hedges over the last quarter but approximately 25% of our North American volumes are hedged for 2011, primarily with swaps at around $6.25 per MMbtu, which should give us the benefit given the current gas prices. And finally, we exit 2010 with 25% debt to cap, which is only slightly higher than the 24% we had entering the year, even though we completed over $11 billion in portfolio transactions. As Steve mentioned, during 2011, we'll maintain a strong focus on building our balance sheet strength further, which is our long-term strategic firepower asset by paying down additional debt. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.
G. Farris: Thank you, Tom. I'd like to summarize what I think the three main messages of the call are. Number one, 2011 is going to be a good year of strong production growth for Apache and a focus on consolidated our enlarged portfolio. We're going to continue to build our balance sheet strength, and we're going to continue to remain opportunistic in the strategic arena. Number two, we had a strong portfolio going into 2010, and after the project licensing and portfolio steps were [indiscernible] in 2010. We have a formidable inventory that can sustain Apache's growth for years to come. And number three, the reality is that we're only scratching the surface. The full opportunity is set and Apache's enlarged portfolio, and the challenge in front of our teams now is to scope and prioritize the best rate-of-return opportunities and for all of us to get after them while staying true to our principles of portfolio balance and financial conservatism. And with that, we're ready for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of [ph] Flynn Del Pozo with IHS.
Unidentified Analyst: Where did your U.S. oil reserve additions come from, the organic ones? And also, the -- I saw some revisions in there for the positive revisions for the U.S., whether those were price or performance-related.
G. Farris: Well, most of the oil from the revisions were priced in the U.S. And I will tell you, internationally, we get a negative because of the Egypt cost sharing. So price helps us in the U.S. and hurts us in Egypt. Certainly, Permian Basin was a big chunk of that, both on the organic side and the buy side with the Permian, and the Gulf of Mexico was a big chunk of that. We also got some liquids help in the Texas Panhandle with our Granite Wash stuff.
Unidentified Analyst: It sounded like you'll will be developing, most intensively, the properties acquired from Mariner. And since the BP properties you had mentioned in the past, that they had not had an operated well drilled on them by BP for four years, I was just kind of wondering whether -- what are the chances you're going to increase the rigs that you'll deploy on the BP's Permian properties?
John Crum: Almost certainly, we'll be increasing the rig activity on the BP properties. I think we've indicated to you in the past, BP was running their Permian Basin from -- so consequently, just getting the records in the hands of the guys that are operating these properties out West has been a little bit of a challenge. We're getting there. The Mariner asset we have to get on with, because we had bought a lot of acreage out there in the last year with continuous drilling clauses. So it's critical that we go in and hold the leases, and then we'll move on to the BP properties.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Thomas Chambers: And then It's a matter of just how much capital you want allocated to it.
Unidentified Analyst: And that might change during the course of the year?
John Crum: Absolutely. If there's one place you would expect to get a little extra allocation, it'd be Permian.
Unidentified Analyst: And then moving on to Australia, I see you've been doing a lot of farm-in deals in Australia. If you could just give me a top-down description of the reason for the farm-ins, and how I should look at it in terms of the geological prospectivity, the regions where you're doing the farm-ins? And what are some of the key companies that you might be partnering with, so I could monitor the results of those companies and see how they might affect Apache.
Rodney Eichler: Well, the areas that we're looking at just continue to extend or expand our existing position on the North West Shelf. So it's all in The North West Shelf carrying a long trend of our existing Carnarvon Basin play areas. Predominantly, up to the northeast portion of the shelf, there are large blocks that we keep available, we pursue this year, to farm in with drilling commitments as well as seismic commitments. So we'll start a seismic survey on one of the blocks this year followed by drilling probably in the second quarter this year. A lot of small companies are involved as partners in the blocks. Just off the top of my head, I can't recall the specifics of the many Indian companies with their partners at some of these concessions.
Unidentified Analyst: But you guys will be reporting the successes, the discoveries. Not another company?
Rodney Eichler: It's us. We're the operator. We'll be reporting you the activities that are significant.
Unidentified Analyst: I noticed a negative oil revision in Canada. What was the reason for that?
John Crum: That's primarily associated with sliding scale royalties and GCA recoveries. As the price of oil goes up, then we get less.
Unidentified Analyst: And then just to address timing issues associated with your acquisitions in the fourth quarter and how that might move over into the first quarter, can you give me any guidance for how much of the production on average during the fourth quarter was from acquired assets and what might happen in the first quarter just to track that movement of the acquired properties?
Alfonso Leon: This is Alfonso Leon. We're going to give others a chance to get in on the question queue. I'll be back in my office right after this. We can follow-up on this after the meeting.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Ray Deacon with Pritchard Capital Partners.
Raymond Deacon - Pritchard Capital Partners, LLC: I just had a question about -- that you partly answered -- it sounds like the first use of incremental capital would be the Permian. Is that right?
G. Farris: Yes, I'd like to follow up a little bit on what John Crum said, because when we talk about increasing capital, we've gone from $400 million in 2010 to going around $1 billion this year. So we're doubling our capital in the Permian because of the acquisitions and because of the opportunities set. The other one is, is that I want to reiterate what John said. We’ve got 10 or 11 rigs running at Deadwood, and that is to save acreage. The fortunate thing is the great play, so we're making great economics at it. But if you have a fixed amount of capital, you want to spend it in an area, and you've got a commitment to make. That's where you're going to spend your money. So if things lighten up, the Permian will be the first place to get it.
Raymond Deacon - Pritchard Capital Partners, LLC: You probably have a better view on this than anybody, but do you still feel pretty strongly about the economics of Kitimat and being able to maintain an oil price base currency of number there with all the growth in Australian volumes over the next few years?
G. Farris: Well, let me put it this way. First of all, we can't make Kitimat work unless it's got an oil-based contract with it. The second thing is, is that I think what we're seeing is a tremendous amount of interest now. And again, and I would preface that, we haven't signed anything yet, but there is some real benefit for anyone that has to import LNG to import it out of the North American market. Because the North American market, it has no limit. So it's not field generated. It's not an investment. So once they are into that market, they have gas inputs to it. So we're seeing a lot of interest.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Allman with JPMorgan.
Joseph Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I think you mentioned about $1 billion of asset sales. Could you talk about -- are you looking to sell some assets kind of across the portfolio? Or is there really a focus in Canada? Because you mentioned specifically about high-grade in Canada.
G. Farris: Well, I think our first look is Canada, and the reason is that if you look at our Horn River position already, and then you look at what we picked up from BP and Noel with the Montney and the Cadomin there, we've got a tremendous asset base there. So it's the easiest place to tie to take the bottom layer of that outlet.
Joseph Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And then, I know you just commented on Kitimat, but could you give us some color on just the marketing that you had done for the off take of LNG, not just at Kitimat, but any intelligence you have on Wheatstone. You mentioned a tremendous amount of interest. Could you just give us some color on that? You think you'll have no trouble marketing Kitimat and Wheatstone? I know you said you have 80% of Wheatstone spoken for. And then also, you could talk about other issues you need to grapple with in terms of permits or anything else at Kitimat.
G. Farris: Well, right now, we just now started marketing Kitimat. And I think all I can say right at the present time is that we see an enthusiastic market that wants to talk about it. In terms of its position with respect to Wheatstone, of course, Chevron is running the Wheatstone sale. They've been very -- obviously, they've been in that market for a long time, and they've done a very good job. In terms of the viability of it in terms of permits, et cetera, it's really going to boil down to market. I mean, this project will go with the market. There's no huge impediment to this project going forward other than the market.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gilbert [ph] Van Borden with Wells Fargo.
Unidentified Analyst: I have a question again on Egypt. How much of your reserve production -- I had heard 24%. Am I wrong? And do you have an escape hatch in case something stirs up there where your facilities are in trouble that you would disperse them over other areas?
G. Farris: The first question is I think reserves are about 13% because of the cost sharing mechanism, and production is about 24% of that, maybe 25%, but that's round numbers. In terms of, and I assume what you're asking is do we have a place to spend that money in other projects? Or is it how do we get our money out of there? I don't quite understand the second question.
Unidentified Analyst: Well, if something happens over there, can you shut down some of the facilities? Move money and stuff over? Or are you going to be in trouble? I'm worried always about expropriation, things like that happening after viewing what happened with the sugar and our friends, Cuba, and in Venezuela, with Chevron. I mean, some of these governments can be very unstable.
G. Farris: First of all, we've been in Egypt for 15 years, and we have a gentlemen on the board that was there. Chuck Pitman is our board member, used to be with Amoco and was in Egypt twice. And as he likes to say, they first discovered oil in Egypt in 1957, and they've never shut any production in based on the political situation there. Given what is going on right now, I tend to think that it better in terms of investment in Egypt. Certainly, the mood is one of much more market-driven and increasing the standard of living for the people. And I will tell you, we're a guest there, so they're the hosts, whoever the host would be. In terms of being able to take that cash somewhere else, we certainly can. I mean, I can't emphasize enough, and I welcome all of you to come to the May 17 conference, is going to show you the opportunity set that we've uncovered so far. And that was not a puffing or wares when we say we've got a current inventory to grow through 2015, 6% to 12%. And that's not necessarily again what we're going to do, but that's the opportunity set that we see at the present time.
Thomas Chambers: I might comment on your point about taxation or confiscation. We do carry an insurance policy that gives us about $1 billion of coverage in the event that things were to get that extreme. But if you think about it, you mentioned a couple of countries like Venezuela. It's a little different in a country like Egypt where they really utilize their demand meets their supply, so they are the big exporter. Venezuela is a big exporter. So it has a very big cash flow stream. And if you nationalize it, you could argue that at least for the short term, that's in their national interest. In a place like Egypt, if you nationalize the production, what you're going to do? Just hand it off to the population? You don't get a cash flow stream that gives you the same economic inducement to take such drastic action. I think having operated there for 15 years, people recognize that production wouldn't be anywhere near where it is if not for Apache's investment over that period of time. So we think that, that helps us in the period ahead.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: When you look at the Gulf of Mexico deepwater, how quickly should we expect you to begin drilling exploration wells once permits are issued or permits are allowed? And how does the deepwater exploration compete for capital relative to the Permian Granite Wash, Montney and your other North American opportunities?
G. Farris: Well, John might comment a little bit on the timing. I'm going to comment a little bit on the competition. I would say, they're complementary, not competitive. We certainly -- a growing concern means you've got to have a lot -- in our opinion, have to have a lot of different ways to win. And we've seen that in every history of every play that's come down the pipe, whether it was Russia or the Austin Chalk in West Texas or East Texas. One play does not make a growing concern. And I think the important thing that you look at, the way we look at the deepwater, it is an exploration. A big reserve play in North America that we don't have anywhere else. And if it is successful on a risk basis, you get a lot of production and a lot of great return out of those projects. So we're going to try to balance that.
John Crum: Yes, I think it really is the last place to find big oil. On the permitting side, I think we're starting to see a little bit of movement, but there's no question it's going to be slow and gradual as we get our regulator completely comfortable with activity out there. You are starting to see some movement, getting assets to the Helix and the MWCC containment vessels has been really important, and that's really what's held up over the last few months.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then separately, you mentioned in your comments that you didn't expect 2011 to be as acquisitive a year as 2010, but that you did see some attractive opportunities. Can you add some more color as to whether those attractive opportunities are more offshore versus North American onshore versus international, and whether you're seeing better opportunities among corporate acquisitions versus asset acquisitions?
G. Farris: Well, I think we generally see better acquisitions in the asset side because number one, you only have to buy the assets that you're going after. So a unique thing about Mariner was -- and if you look at where we are active right now, we're active in every place that they were. So it was very easy. It was almost an asset acquisition in the guise of a merger because we really fit in each one of those asset areas. In terms of going forward, each one of the regions we're in, we'd like to get bigger. With the exception and not because -- I'm optimistic about Argentina, I just think even the circumstances in the world today, we might not spend the kind of money there that we've spent in other parts of the world. But we're an opportunistic company. Sometimes, you buy things better than you drill and vice versa.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Morris with Citigroup.
Robert Morris: Steve, you mentioned the capital budget is $7.5 billion and no matter how you slice, it looks like cash flow was going to be above that. And then you'll have another $1 billion probably come in from asset sales. I know you said you want to leave room for debt reduction, but do you have a goal in mind for the debt reduction so that once you hit that we can look at any excess then going back into drilling?
G. Farris: Well, I'm sitting here looking at our Treasurer, so I'm going to let Matt Dundrea, who's our Senior Vice President and Treasurer, answer that question.
Matthew Dundrea: We don't have a specific hard target debt level, but we're going to aim for something in between $7.5 billion and $8 billion. Beyond that, I think that might free up some funds for capital.
Robert Morris: So your total debt is $7.5 billion to $8.5 billion.
Matthew Dundrea: I'm sorry, what was that?
Robert Morris: It's $7.5 billion to $8.5 billion, what number is that?
Matthew Dundrea: $7.5 billion to $8 billion.
G. Farris: We're at $8.1 billion at the end of the year.
Matthew Dundrea: Exactly.
Robert Morris: So you'll probably be at $1 billion from the asset disposition. So it’s likely -- some of that's going to go to drilling?
G. Farris: If current strip holds up, you're going to see an additional capital infusion.
Matthew Dundrea: Yes, we have a conservative plan at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Christensen with Buckingham Research.
Robert Christensen - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Could you define the, I guess, gas shale play in Argentina unconventional a little bit more? Thickness and that kind of thing and the type of well you've drilled? And has there been any other company with a couple of well results that we could go look at?
Rodney Eichler: To our knowledge, there are no horizontal wells to be drilled in the shales in Argentina. We're drilling the first one. That well is underway, and I really cannot release any information regarding the well at this time as we're not completely to our total depth. [indiscernible] is a very active player and our partner in many of these blocks. They have drilled some vertical wells as have we, to test the concept of shale richness. It's really a test of proof of concept stage. All the ingredients that are there geologically for robust unconventional resource in at least the Bakken [indiscernible] shale and the [indiscernible] shale in the Central Neuquén Basin area. I guess that's about all I can say right now.
G. Farris: The only point I would make is usually, when you see shale plays, you see a few people that are -- and you see them down there, same folks are punting around down there. I mean, this is not an unknown quantity. It's just we've been down there long enough, but we've got a significant acreage position ahead of a lot of other folks.
Robert Christensen - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Is it a fixed shale? And how long is your lateral? How many stages do you think you'll frac it, I mean, the first well?
Rodney Eichler: The current well is, we anticipate, 1,000-meter lateral, 10-frac stages.
Robert Christensen - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And the thickness of the rock reservoir?
Rodney Eichler: I'd say the general to vertical thickness is probably in -- productive thickness is probably 200 meters to 300 meters.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Rehan Rashid with FBR Capital Markets.
Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: In the U.K., any major exploratory projects for the rest of this year?
Rodney Eichler: Yes. So area aside from our exploitation around Forties. As I mentioned in my remarks, we have a couple of prospects that are operated by Talisman, which we will likely see drilled later in 2011. And of course, we picked up four blocks in the most recent bid round, which we'll be doing the necessary evaluation work to lead the drilling late this year or in 2012.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: Can you tell us, please, what was the exit rate on production for 2010? And if you could maybe quantify the outages because obviously, there's a fair amount of down time, I guess, U.K. and Australia.
G. Farris: Yes, I think the biggest -- I don't remember the December number. Alfonso can get with it offline. I think say the biggest difference between that and what we posted is we had Van Gogh off, which is about 22,000 barrels a day, and we also had about 9,000 barrels a day off in the North Sea. I mean, it was -- the North Sea stuff probably won't come back until September. Van Gogh started to come back up, but it was off all of January and will be off a portion of February. And then we've had three cyclones in the Gulf. So, I mean, in the Carnarvon Basin.
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: This one, I know, is going to be difficult to answer, but I'm going to try anyway. So you're already at just over $8 billion as Bob pointed out. It sounds you're pretty quickly going to get to your debt targets. So how should we think about the sensitivity of your growth numbers to capital expenditure? Like I said, I know it's a pretty tough one to answer, but if you could at least try and frame it, that would be great.
G. Farris: Well, frankly, and I am going to say that I don't have any budgeting numbers to go by, it's just an obvious answer. And that is we've got all the base costs in the base budget. So you've got all your seismic costs, all those kind of costs are in the base budget. So most of the things that you'll be seeing other than some exploration stuff that we had a little program in Australia or if somewhere else, deepwater, Gulf of Mexico, God forbid, if we actually got a permit to drill there. You're going to see performing capital. So you should see a disproportionate benefit out of the incremental capital that we spend based on the overall capital budget that we rolled out there right now.
Thomas Chambers: That's absolutely right, and then kind of mitigating that is the earlier we let that capital go, the more you'll see in the annual average. So part of the juggling is we want to have some confidence that these prices are going to stay at these levels before we release too much capital. So there's a balance act is what I'm trying to say.
G. Farris: And the sooner we can get a package out on the street and sold, we'll be -- there's a lot of moving parts going into this year. And the biggest thing I would say is, I want and I hope everybody recognize what I'm saying, the last two years we spent $8 billion drilling oil and that kind of stuff. We spent $12 billion in acquisitions. So our goal for 2011, obviously, is purely capital allocation. This is going to come from those acquisitions. But the biggest thing it brought us is that if we don't buy another thing for the next five years, we can grow this thing -- the high single-digit numbers anyway. So we've set ourselves up to some growth going forward that is significant.
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: There's a lot of running room, Steve. I guess two very quick follow-ups, and I'll leave it to somebody else. Could you give us an idea or contract updates rather on Australia gas? And the final one is I just wanted to be clear on the 5,000 locations I think John mentioned in the Permian, how does -- is that an apples-to-apples comparison with what you gave us at the time of the deal? Or if you could maybe just elaborate on what's happened to the visibility that you gave us with the Yeso and the Spar barrier at the time, in terms of drilling activity. I mean in other words, how much have you been able to evaluate and add to your drilling locations in the BP assets?
G. Farris: The gas contracts in Australia -- I think, we are pursuing contracts that are significantly higher. I think we probably will announce some. But before we do that, I'd better not comment on that. But that is going to happen, if you understand what I'm saying. In terms of locations, John?
John Crum: Yes, I guess, Doug, what I'd say is, obviously, we continue to work to go along. And one of our key work processes is really developing resource potential across all of our acreage. So we're just getting through all of these, but we're gradually cataloging what we know are going to be developable assets out there. So that's kind of the number we're at right now and I think we can get higher than that pretty easily.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company International: You mentioned that your operations have not been impacted in Egypt. However, some service companies have talked about limited activity. What do field operations look like now versus a month ago?
Rodney Eichler: Prior to the changes in government, mid-January, we had 23 rigs operating in the desert. And today, we have 23 rigs operating. In fact, that same number operating continually. No single well was shut down with the exception of one wildcat. We were drilling in the far reaches of the Western Desert near Libya. And we got to a safe place to set casing and temporarily abandon the well for lack of services at a remote location. We didn't want to risk a potential well control problem without having a way of correcting that. That well has since been restored to drilling operations. I think we had one or two days where diesel fuel was a little bit short, but that was corrected immediately by the government. And essentially, we had, as I said, we had no noticeable changes, a slight inconvenience, but no real change in the production operations. Gas plants operating straight through, no change in the gas production crew. Same with oil production.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company International: And then, now that you're starting to get your hands around the BP assets that you purchased in the Permian, is there anything that you find, particularly in treating from those BP assets, something that you might want to move higher up in the queue?
John Crum: Well, I don't know that I've got something that runs in front of that Yeso play, because that's just about as good as it gets. So that's the first thing that showed up. John Christmann was in the office this morning and said that he had just signed an AFP to drill nine wells for Penn section in the Wilshire acreage. So that's probably the next interesting thing we'll get started on.
G. Farris: And John Christmann is, for those of you who don't know, is our Regional Vice President in Midland.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons & Company International: And then just one housekeeping question on when do you plan to file your 10-K?
Thomas Chambers: On the 28th of February.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Malone with Ticonderoga.
John Malone - Ticonderoga Securities LLC: Can you guys speak at all as to the status of your pilot program up in New Brunswick? Any new data on those wells?
John Crum: Well, I'd love to give you some good news, but we're really still trying to figure out what's happened there. I feel like we've got good frac jobs on them, but they're not coming back very quick. We've set up one of the wells to be gas lifted so that we can continue to get the water off of them. I guess we got a number of scientists working on it, and we'll be able to get back to you once we know a little more.
G. Farris: I think like any -- one thing I would say about that whether it's -- we drilled a couple of dusters, or not really dusters, just teasers in Chile. We have 1 million acres in Chile. We have a big acreage position in New Brunswick. And I will tell you, both of them had hydrocarbons in them. We just got to figure out how to, technically, how to get it out of the ground.
Operator: And your final question for the day comes from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC Capital.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: I want to see if you could kind of break down your $7.5 billion CapEx budget by country in sort of rough terms for us here.
Alfonso Leon: If you go to the website and you look on the supplemental disclosure for the fourth quarter earnings, you'll see a bullet table breakdown of the capital by region.
G. Farris: For 2011.
Alfonso Leon: For 2011 on a budget base.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: I guess with respect to the North Sea, you're looking at your realized oil price in the fourth quarter, it's down a fair bit. It was about 11% discount to Brent. The past it was sort of 2%, 3% discount. Anything going on there that we should be concerned about? I mean, you guys still getting pretty close to Brent on your North Sea oil?
Rodney Eichler: Yes. It could be a signing issue that you may be looking at.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Any new results in the Granite Wash that do you guys care to share?
John Crum: I don't think we have anything new. That continues to be just a great play for us. We continue to push, obviously, looking for the ones that have the highest liquid contents. I've told you in the past about the Hogshooter. Ten of those 40 wells we've drilled this year with Hogshooter. Our market horizontals appeared to be working pretty well, and then we're working the Cleveland actually as well, in horizontal sections up north of there.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's Q&A portion of the call. Speakers, do you have any closing remarks?
Alfonso Leon: Thank you, all, very much for your time. For any follow-up questions, I'll be right back in my office. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Apache Corporation Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Release. Today's presentation will be hosted by Mr. Tom Chambers, Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor Relations. Mr. Chambers, please go ahead.
Thomas Chambers: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us for Apache Corporation's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we reported net income of $765 million or $2.12 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items that impact the comparability of results totaled $791 million or $2.19 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations totaled $2 billion. On today's call, we'll have four speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will lead off followed by Roger Plank, our President; John Crum, Co-Chief Operating Officer and President, North America; and then Rod Eichler, Co-Chief Operating Officer and President of International. We prepared our usual detailed supplemental data package for your use, which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discussed, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or costs incurred. This data package can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financialdata Today's discussions may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions and no assurances can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website. With that I'll turn the call over to Steve.
G. Farris: Thank you, Tom and good afternoon, everyone and thank all of you for joining us for our third quarter 2010 results call. Those of you who have followed us for many years know that Apache has a truly unique culture and is involved with strong sense of urgency and paramount of our employees and an independent mindset. And Apache's culture really is that the heart of how we build value and has taken us from very humble position not so long ago to where we are today. And I don't think there's anything that exemplifies more our third quarter, what that culture is capable of delivering for our shareholders. On the portfolio side, we announced the $7 billion acquisition of three entire upstream operating regions from BP and the Permian Basin, Canada and Egypt. These three positions have an excellent fit with our existing carriers and provide us with a rich inventory of growth and value enhancement opportunity for years to come. It was July 20, the last conference call, we were just announcing this step, and we were getting ready to get on a plane to go sell stock and debt for this important step forward. And while we clearly believed that the transaction had all the ingredients to make a great deal for our shareholders, we really didn't know how the share price would react, given the amount of new stock we were about to issue. Well, as most of you know, the stock actually went up by 5% in the three days after we announced, and this is opposite of what generally happens. Internally, we took that as an endorsement of Apache's ability to generate value out of the transaction. Obviously, we're honored with the vote of confidence. I want to ensure all of you, we'll do everything humanly possible to make good on this investment, to create long-term value for our shareholders. As of about an hour ago, we have now closed all three of the BP packages, if you haven't looked at the Wire, we just closed Egypt today. But we are integrating the people and starting to get our arms around the assets. In addition, we expect to close on our merger with Mariner Energy when the vote ends on November 10. We couldn't be more pleased and excited about the opportunity set we are building into our portfolio with the $11 billion in acquisitions. Through these steps we have added years of inventory to our core regions and have built the right footprint in what we believe are two new areas for us, the Deepwater oil exploration and LNG. LNG, for us, means the monetization of large North American gas resources at oil length prices. We've taken these steps on our own way which is the Apache way and we're confident that we'll constitute important foundations for Apache's continued growth and profitability during the coming decade. On the operating front, in the third quarter, we had a very successful quarter, with production was up 10% year-on-year and our costs and expenses on a per unit basis, excluding DD&A, it was down 3% year-on-year. John, Rod and Roger will give you more color on our results and developments during the quarter in a moment. Before getting to that, I'd like to put 2010 in a broader context, starting with where we were at the beginning of 2010 and what we look like going into 2011. If you recall, in February of this year on our 2009 year-end conference call, we were very bullish on what we've received in the acquisition market. We had amassed over $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and with commodity prices at more reasonable levels, we indicated that we would be very actively pursuing acquisition opportunity. Little did we know how attractive it would become. After the dust settles, and we have closed on all $11 billion of assets, apache's share count would have increased by approximately 12%, and we project we will end the year with a debt to cap of under 27%. Now on the flip side, on the production side, we are projecting December 2010 average production to exceed 775,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. So if you use the first quarter 2010 as a baseline, when Apache's production averaged 586,000 barrels of oil equivalent, we're entering 2011 with a third more firepower than we entered 2010. That added firepower will give us more cash flow to exploit the 3.8 million acres we acquired across three of the most prolific core areas; Canada, Permian and Western Desert of Egypt. And the new core areas we've added in deepwater Gulf of Mexico has over 125 undeveloped blocks and interest in two world-class discoveries in Lucius and Heidelberg. Obviously, we're extremely excited about what we've been able to add to what we consider an already formative base and the opportunity that they bring to continue to add long-term value to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Roger, John and Rod to talk about 2010 and '11 in a little more detail. Roger?
Roger Plank: Okay. Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Steve commented about how 2010 is shaping up and in a minute, I'm going to give a further glimpse of what may be a truly outstanding 2011. But before delving into next year I'd like to provide a few key highlights, financial highlights to the current quarter. We think we have fine results, even though there were a lot of moving parts with all these transactions closing. Production was up 3% over second quarter to a record 667,000 barrels of oil equivalent. Oil and liquids were, once again the king, representing just over half our production, but over 3/4 of our revenue. Cash costs per boe were essentially flat with second quarter while DD&A was up 3% as you might expect, given that our acquisitions remain at prices above our historic reserve cost. Debt ended at $6.5 billion and debt to cap at 23%, and that excludes $1.2 billion of cash on the books at quarter's end. Also, just of our year of acquisitions doesn't overshadow the considerable progress we're making on the organic side of our business. You should know that from the first quarter to the third, our oil production jumped 17% or 48,000 barrels per day, and over 3/4 of that growth was attributable solely to drilling and development activities, primarily in Egypt and especially, Australia. Turning to 2011. We're just now in the early stage of the core of next year's plan, but one thing seems certain, our year-over-year production growth should be well into the double digit. Exactly how much our production growth depends on our ultimate capital budget, which will be fine tuned between now and the year end. Our preliminary however, our capital budget is likely to reach or exceed $7 billion, up from around $6 billion this year and well within cash flow at prices currently indicated for next year. We've hedged oil for 2011 to protect cash flow and its current active capital campaign. While we believe that the supply and demand outlook strongly favors oil, with over 3/4 of our revenue tied to oil and liquids since last quarter, we've hedged 54,000 barrels per day for 2011. We used costless collars with floors between $65 to $70 to protect the downside and ceilings between $95 to $103 to retain upside potential. We now have about 100,000 barrels per day hedged in total for 2011 or just over 1/4 of our post-merger liquids production. In addition to ensuring sufficient cash flow and capital to get after the upside on recently acquired properties, we are focusing particular attention on our extensive inventory of oil and liquids prospect for next year. I can't tell you how nice it is to have a deep inventory of oil prospects already enhanced and not have to join the herd chasing after high-cost oil opportunities after essentially the train's already left the station. I would like not to hedge any additional North American gases at today's low prices. And we are continuing to focus capital on those international gas projects, which are commanding substantially higher prices. Everyday oil remains at this lumpy levels since more debt reduction than earlier anticipated. Additionally, to ensure that we make a major dent in our debt, which should peak following the Mariner merger at over $8 billion, we anticipate selling $1 billion of property sometime in the first half of 2011. We're just now in the process of determining which properties we'll be selling. So it's a bit early to tell the precise location, timing and impact of those sales. The combination of high oil prices and property sales meant lower debt and greater financial flexibility, consistent with an A-rated company. With double-digit production growth pretty much a shoo-in for 2011, a portfolio that's low in oil, a deep inventory of drilling opportunities and a strong financial position, we look forward to what could prove to be a better year in 2011. John?
John Crum: Thank you, Roger. Our third quarter North American activity has been dominated by the efforts associated with the integration of more than $10 billion in assets, being added to our portfolio this year. We closed the BP Permian transaction in the third quarter and the Canadian piece closed in early October. We took over operations in the BP Canada properties on Monday of this week and welcomed almost 300 new Apaches. We will take over the BP Permian assets December 1, meanwhile, we expect to close on the Mariner merger next week after their shareholder meeting on November 10. Third quarter North American production was up over 7% versus second quarter to just under 309,000 barrels equivalent per day. Fourth quarter volumes will be up substantially as we see the impact of BP and Mariner acquisitions. Gulf Coast production increased 7% from the second quarter. Drilling activity offshore continues to be severely impacted by the permitting process associated with post and conduit requirements. While our Gulf region has received seven of the first 12 permits given to the Gulf of Mexico, requiring both NTL-05 and NTL-06 compliance. They remain significantly behind the plans for the year. At least for now the lack of clarity on the process makes it difficult for the BOEM [Bureau of Ocean Energy Management] to approve anything in a timely fashion. We are however, presently running five jack-up rigs and one platform rig offshore, drilling primarily for oil targets. With permitting delays resolved, we expect to have a very strong 2011 drilling program with the addition of the new assets from Devon and Mariner. Our third quarter project of note is the redevelopment of the hurricane-damaged Eugene Island 330 field now underway. Three wells have already been drilled and are expected to add some 2,000 barrels a day, with additional drilling to extend into mid-2011 on the 63% working interest field. In the Permian region, we increased production by 21% on partial quarter BP volumes at a very active drilling program. Permian region production is expected to be up again on the fourth quarter as core BP volumes and the Mariner assets are added in. The BP and Mariner transactions allow our newly formed Permian region to add substantially to an already robust oil Permian drilling inventory with at least 3,000 new identified locations. The region was already very active in the quarter with seven rigs, drilling 73 new wells, while 116 wells were completed as we caught up on a backlog of frac stimulation work. With the addition of the Mariner properties later this month, we expect to keep up the 20 rigs running in the Permian for 2011. We also reached agreement with Concho on the BP, more above the Yeso play in New Mexico. Apache acquired a 60% working interest in the operatorship of the joint properties. We have identified 800 drillable locations in the play and expect to be very active there next year. The region continues to evaluate horizontal drilling potentials in a variety of well known producing intervals in the basin. We continue to have success with horizontal completions in all water fluid operations notably North McElroy in the Grayburg formation, TXL South in the Clearfork and Shafter Lake in the San Andres, where we're seeing IPs in the 250 to 400 barrel a day range. The Central region also increased production by 7% from the second quarter. Importantly, distributionally gas coverage was up almost 29% on their oil productions. The region activity continues to be dominated by horizontal multi-stage frac operations in the liquid-rich Granite Wash play in Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. We expect to drill 40 horizontal Granite Wash wells this year. The first 19 are currently on production and producing a net of 2,600 barrels of oil a day and some 40 million feet of gas. As in the Permian, we continue to look for additional applications for horizontal drilling. With this in mind, we recently test what we believe to be the first horizontal test on the of the Hogshooter Wash interval of the Granite Wash play. This morning, we announced two very successful tests. Each well produced the initial rates of over 2,000 barrels of oil a day and continue to average more than 700 barrels a day and 3.5 million feet of gas after two months. We expect to drill 10 additional Hogshooter tests in 2011. Our Canada region production decreased 1.8% from the second quarter. That figure will be up substantially in the fourth quarter as we add in BP volumes and ramp up at Horn River. Our 50%-owned Horn River production continues to build and reach the 100 million per day gross raw gas milestone in August and is expected to reach 200 million per day by first quarter of 2011. We have 18 new wells on production in 2010 and expect to bring another 12 on during the remainder of the year. We will leave the year with 24 wells already drilled and awaiting completion. As mentioned earlier, our Canadian region is quickly integrating BP properties with the help of the 300 new Apaches who moved in last Monday. While it's a little crowded in our Calgary office, while we complete the space build out, we wanted to get the things together as soon as possible. The most notable operation in the BP asset base in Canada is the Noel field producing from the Cadomin and Doig intervals. In addition, the field appears to have significant modeling potential, for which testing is now underway. Noel field production is currently at 62 million cubic feet of gas per day and is expected to reach 96 million by the end of the year and 125 million by the second quarter of 2011. The region is especially excited about the strong drilling inventory and the multitude of workover recompletion opportunities that are available with the new BP acquisition. And now Rod Eichler will give you an update on international.
Rodney Eichler: Thank you, John. Apache's international operations saw a good quarter, averaging 359,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with production increasing in three out of the four countries of operation. Egypt's gross production increased 3% to 323,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Net production was only up slightly resulting from timing differences in the PSC cost recovery mechanism. New production from Faghur Basin fields and discoveries as well as from our mature development lease help push gross operated oil and gas production above the 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day mark for the third consecutive quarter. Phase 2 of the Faghur Basin infrastructure project designed to upgrade capacity to 40,000 barrels of oil per day was completed on schedule on September 30. The acquisition of BP's risk-rated assets is complete. All contracts and agreements have been finalized and the final approvement from the government of Egypt was received today, closing occurred about an hour ago. Upon assuming operatorship, in terms of pinging on the 24-inch Abu Gharadig to Dashur pipeline will commence and we expect it to be completed by year end. Minor modifications of the existing system will be completed during first quarter of 2011 that will allow high liquid yield gas from the Faghur Basin to bypass the Salam gas plant and be directed to our existing 18-inch southern pipeline in the newly acquired Abu Gharadig plant and onward to the national gas, we had at the 24-inch Abu Gharadig to Dashur pipeline. So on gas train five and the Southern Pipeline loop projects should commence in early 2011. FEED studies with both the gas plant and the pipeline expansion have been completed. Negotiations to enter into EPC contracts are expected to be completed in the first quarter with project completions forecast in late 2012. With the addition of the BP properties [indiscernible] continued drilling success in the Faghur and the two basins and each production infrastructure improvements for 2011 drilling campaign is set to be a busy one, with the forecast number of exploratory and appraisal tests up over 50% compared to 2010 and total well count expected to exceed 200 gross wells. In Australia, net production decreased a modest 5% in second quarter. Gas production decreased due to lower customer nominations, while oil production decreased due to natural decline in the Van Gogh oilfield. Van Gogh [indiscernible] had a 52.5% working interest, averaged 23,700 barrels of oil per day net during the quarter, and the field has produced 11.2 million barrels gross, since startup in February, achieving project pay out in late September. On October 4, we shut in Van Gogh production in the FPSO production seals in the swivel portion of a detachable torque boring [ph] of DTM system were found to be leaking and no hydrocarbon or liquids will leak to the ocean. The failure of all swivel seals at the same time is pretty much impressive, and it's not an event that could have been reasonably foreseen. The result is that we have gone from a total seal failure to restarting production in 19 days. The temporary repairs have restored partial production to approximately 2,500 barrels of oil per day gross. Permanent repairs will allow Van Gogh to return to full production and 40,000 barrels of oil per day gross by mid-December. The BHP-operated Pyrenees FPSO development, in which Apache has a working interest that ranges from 28.5% to 31.5% continue to perform well in the third quarter, with net production averaging 23,600 barrels of oil per day, up 2,300 barrels per day on the second quarter. Total production from Pyrenees from start up through September 30 was 17.1 million barrels of oil gross. Pyrenees continues to believe in the steady 94,000 and 98,000 barrels of oil per day gross. Delta, Halyard and Devil Creek development projects remain on schedule to deliver first gas to the Western Australia domestic market in 2011. Halyard, in which Apache has a 55% working interest has a one-well tie back of the 2008 halyard gas discovery to our Varanus Island hub. First gas expected in May 2011. The Halyard project is designed for future well tie-ins expected at exploration success in the greater east far area. For example, Apache recently acquired a 55% in operatorship of the adjacent Spar field. The Spar-2 appraisal well drilled in October found 163 feet of net gas play in the Upper Morrow objective. Upon testing and completion of this well, we've tied into the Halyard system. The Devil Creek development project in which Apache has a 55% working interest, is 60% complete through September and are scheduled to deliver first gas from our Reindeer field by November of 2011. Fabrication of the Reindeer Wellhead Platform is 90% and installation of the 16-inch onshore raw gas pipeline from the beach process to the gas plant has been completed. To expand our exploration drilling inventory in 2011 and beyond, we've acquired eight new blocks in the Carnarvon Basin via purchase of Faghur getting over 10,000 square kilometers of new exploration acreage, thus increasing our total acreage position in the basin by 35. Apache will operate all eight blocks at average to the 52%. 4,600 square kilometers of new drilling site will be acquired in these blocks, starting in December of 2010. Australia continues to offer attractive gas prices for new long term domestic contracts for further existing products. In addition, we made progress in monetizing our Julimar gas, signed two separate hedge of agreement for 20-year supply of LNG at oil-linked prices. One of these agreements with the Tokyo Electric and the other one is with KOGAS [Korea Gas Corporation]. We also continued to add growth to our pipeline with the sanction of the Macedon domestic gas development project and the successful appraisal of our 2009 oil discovery at Balnaves. In the North Sea, production was flat in the second quarter. Increased output from our drilling program is offset by planned downtime at Bravo and Charlie platforms, an active drilling program that continue in Forties during the third quarter. Two of the field's four platform rigs will be in continuous operation. In addition, by quarter end, the Lowen Gorilla Seven jack up will begin a six-month drilling training campaign over the Echo platform. Drilling has not taken place in Echo since July of 2005. A satellite platform bridge linked to the Alpha platform is progressing for installation in 2012. This project will allow expansion of critical utilities for the field, including expanding power generation, fuel processing capacity, high-pressure gas impression, dehydration, and most importantly 18 new slots for drilling. During the quarter, a new time lapse or 4D seismic survey was completed in Forties, with fast-track process data, coming available in time to influence the drilling locations previously referenced to Echo. 4D Seismic imaging has driven the majority of drilling success at Forties for the seven years. This data, along with additional drilling slots and for the Alpha satellite platform should enable Forties to maintain steady production in the 60,000 barrel day range over the next three plus years. In Argentina net production is at 7% for the second quarter. Gas production increased 11% as a result of the successful 2010 gas plus drilling program in Neuquen, The TDS San Sebastian drilling program and the increase in the order demand. For the gas plus pricing program, we've signed one gas contract for 28 million feet gas per day in August 2010 with Pampa Energy and we expect to sign a second contract with Pampa to 25 million a day this month. These two contracts were effective January 1, 2011, and specify a $5 per million BTU gas price for three years. These contracts will go a long way in pulling up our basket price in Neuquen Basin of our $3 per million BTU. In support of these contracts Apache has drilled 18 wells a day in two fields in Neuquen Basin, with production capacity of 47 million cubic feet of gas per day. Additional wells are currently drilling. And by January 1, 2011, Apache will have more than 53 million feet of gas per day available to satisfy these higher-prices gas contracts. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now be happy to open up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: I wanted to see if you can give us an update on what you're seeing in the LNG markets in terms of willingness and maybe price sensitivity, the long-term contracts and then an update on how you're thinking about Kitimat?
G. Farris: Well, we were in a situation where we were really just gone out to the market because of our Wheatstone. The Wheatstone 2 contracts that were signed was very important and we wanted to have that gas on the market before we really started to actively procuring contracts at Kitimat. Right now, we're very early. Of course we have an awful lot of interest of potential buyers that want to buy gas. I don't think that there's any question, and I hear it all the time. Is it going to be gas-related? There's no projects in the world that are going to build an LNG-facility based on a gas price. It's going to have to be based on an oil price. And it's really too early to tell what that slope is going to look like, Brian.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Separately in the Granite Wash, can you add a little bit more color regarding what zones you drilled and how you see the potential for further running room and in extent of the liquids content and the oil content that you saw with these two wells, extending to other parts of your acreage.
John Crum: Brian, obviously, this is first time we tested the Hogshooter in a horizontal fashion. So it was really good results. There tends to a little shy shower in the sequence, and obviously, as our liquid yields -- the issue, of course, is that, that extends across the entire acreage base. The good news is these wells are more than five miles apart, so it's not like this is an isolated area. We have some 200,000 acres we control in this play. So obviously, we'll be casting this with additional wells next year. We presently plan 10 Hogshooter intervals alone. We continue to test the additional intervals within the Granite Wash. That sequence can change anywhere from two to eight or so separate little sand intervals. And so we're going to continue to figure out where the best place to go with our future drillings. Obviously, it's liquids.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And what do you see with the current infrastructure? If there are any infrastructure constraints at what level of rig count you could take it up to as more of a capacity perspective? How aggressive could you ramp that up, if you want to next year?
John Crum: The natural gas prices does have something to do with that. Obviously, these high liquid yields helps our economics substantially. But I think a lot of the infrastructure issues are associated with gas back outs and the bottom line is these kinds of prices, conventional drilling's kind of drying up. So we haven't seen any real change. We would expect to run some 10 Granite Wash rigs next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Merrill Lynch.
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: I wanted to start off with the production guidance. So the production discussion, I guess, you had a few minutes ago. If we just look at what you're saying about December, and let's assume we took Q3 as a flat rate for October, November just as a starting point, and then run December for next year, assuming that new projects offset declines, I guess, you could have about 19% growth rate year-over-year. Am I smoking something, or is that in the ballpark? And then what, really, do you see as the key project moving parts for next year that could change that one way or the other?
G. Farris: Well, I think your math is probably pretty correct. The real question obviously is, and it always is, and people don't want to hear it, is commodity price. Because you really got to have capital to put on these properties. And right now, frankly, we have very good oil prices and I don't know whether the fed's buying treasury is going to help -- the bond market is going to help the economy, but it's damn sure helping the oil price. That's good news for us. The 50% of our production is on the oil side. The real question besides commodity prices is what we sell and when we sell it? We're dedicated to getting our debt to cap down and that is we're at below 27% at the end of the year. If we sold $1 billion, I mean, it would help us greatly to be down in the same category we were at the beginning of the year and we really haven't identified those properties yet. But we're going to have -- I mean, if you just look at the metrics, you're going to have good numbers next year, it's going to be hard not to frankly.
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: Capital expenditure on the BP assets that you've acquired, could you identify what step up might be, I think, when you did the deal you suggested BP was something planning something like a $400 million, $500 million CapEx plan. What would your numbers likely to look like on those properties?
G. Farris: In fact, all our Corporate Engineering Group and our planning group have just now made a loop to everyone of the regions, including the Permian and Canada. Quite frankly, John mentioned the Yeso play. I mean, we've identified 800 locations. It's a question of how many rigs you want to run out there. This isn't a question of how much money could we spend. It's going to be how much money will we spend in each one of these areas. Because, frankly, you could double that number in the Permian Basin right now. In terms of opportunity sets and the real issue is going to be how do we balance that portfolio. It's going to be one of our real strategic issues this year.
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: I just wanted to drill a little bit on a couple of specific assets. Egypt, first of all, so the pipeline looks like it's going to be taken care of next year. What is your latest thoughts in terms of how much of your 300 million a day, you're going to be able to open up. And finally, Mist Mountain, you never really seem to talk about that too much. Any thoughts on the 8 trillion cubic feet asset that doesn't really seem to get much of a profile?
G. Farris: The first part, dealing with the $300 million a day, and this is referencing the shut in gas that we have on wells that have already been drilled and completed in the Collin [ph] area. The existing pipeline, and I'm talking about the remote components to evacuate the gas to this new route. One is our Southern 18-inch gas pipeline, prices are in place for the last decade, of which KX [ph] and BP abrogated plant and then lanced [ph] onto a 24 inch abrogated short pipeline. That line is old and have been derated and is really carrying about 40 million to 45 million cubic feet of gas a day at present. Our expectation is to be able to add because the configuration of gas plants downstream, the gases are slightly different composition that we have in the northwestern part of desert. We're bringing the two gas down there. And it's our expectation as the pipeline pigs out, it can be rerated to its original rating approximately 150 million a day that we should be able to add about 85 to perhaps 100 million a day into that line from Marmacu [ph] Basin fields sometime in 2011. That'll be incremental to the existing gas which is going down the line right now and bring it to its full capacity.
John Crum: And on Mist Mountain point, obviously, that's coal bed methane in Southern Canada. We see that project needs a substantial amount of additional research and certainly consultation before we're able to move forward. And most importantly, it needs some higher gas prices, so we're going to continue to work it. It's obviously pretty exciting to play with that kind of resource in place. So I don't think you'll see us massively drilling in Mist Mountain next year though.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets Corporation: Want to get a sense of if you guys have come up with sort of an approximate of well inventory of projects in the Granite Wash at this point in time?
John Crum: We have a substantial inventory. And I can tell you that the inventory is somewhat dynamic. We continue to move different wells to the top of the list but there's an excess of 1,000 locations that we know we have out there. So it's just a matter of which ones we're were going to drill first. Like I told you, we think we can keep about 10 rigs running. The only issues out there today have been access to frac equipment and that'll probably continue to be an issue.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets Corporation: And how many wells you think you guys can drill in a year with 10 rigs out there and what do those wells cost you, roughly, a piece to drill?
John Crum: We're spending about somewhere in the $5 million range, sometimes it's $6 million, depends on how many times we frac these things. But one of the interesting pieces we're were doing, we did do a dual lateral this year. We have not completed the second lateral yet. But that could change our price structure on a per lateral basis substantially. We will complete the second lateral early next year, and then we'll some good feel for where that can go. So 10 rigs we can drill a well of roughly every month. So if you have 10 rigs running, you could drill 100 wells roughly.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets Corporation: In terms of when you guys are talking about in Egypt, it sounds like your Phase 2 with Faghur, when you start up here, I guess it already has. So trying to get a sense of what the incremental volumes are going to be from that Phase 2?
G. Farris: Phase 1 was completed back in May and that was the initial early production facility that ended up 20,000 barrels of oil per day. That was completed on scheduled. Phase 2, which we're ramping up an additional 20,000 to 40,000 which was complete at the end of September, and that is what's currently producing. We have a Phase 3, which is really to capture the 35 million to 40 million cubic feet of gas per day that's associated with oil. And that’ll be complete probably in the second quarter of 2011.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets Corporation: I just want to clarify one of the comments I thought I heard in the call. Did you guys say that your thoughts your North Sea Forties production would be in the low 60,000 barrel a day range for the next, roughly, three years. Is that right?
G. Farris: That's correct.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets Corporation: I just wanted to get a sense on the Permian. Kind of where you guys thought you were in terms of evaluating some of these new horizontal plays out There. Is Kind of early days for you? Have you done some test wells? Can you give us a sense of kind of where you are there?
John Crum: Well, I gave you a few examples of some things we've done and I think, we have tested eight different horizons out there with horizontal wells already this year. And we're finding some interesting results. I got to tell you, I'm not ready to share all of that information because was obviously some of that's critical as we gather up acreage around our successes. But we have had good results we've shared with you, a somewhat surprising benefit horizontal in these old water plugs. We'll just continue to be amazed. We're drilling wells that come in at 400 barrels a day on fields that have been 60, 70 years old and had been water flooded and on 10-acre spacing. So we think the potential for horizontal drilling in the Permian is just unbelievable, really.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets Corporation: Looking at production real quick. I think you guys were just talking about getting to just over 775,000 barrels a day in December. I guess, if I just kind of think about the math from a high level, that you guys are adding somewhere around 140,000 barrels a day from acquisition and producing about 660,000 barrels a day a little bit over that I guess in the third quarter. If I add those two up gets me closer to 800,000. Is there any declines between that 800,000 and the 775,000? Maybe your Gulf volume is expected to drop a little bit or can you provide any color on that?
G. Farris: We don't anticipate to shoot the gun all the time. So we're comfortable with 775,000 right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Philip Dodge with Tuohy Brothers Research
Philip Dodge - Stanford Group Company: This might be a question that would be better at the next conference call, but let me try it anyway. How do you stand on what you might do on the Mariner properties after the closing? And can you reveal whether Mariner itself has applied for any drilling permits either on their shallow water or even on their operated deepwater?
John Crum: Yes, I can tell you that we will have some substantial activity, especially associated with the shallow water on the shelf. That stuff will be merged into our existing Gulf of Mexico shelf operation. On the other side, Mariner has got a number of applications in certainly associated around tie backs of existing projects that they want to get tied back to existing platforms. We expect those to clear relatively soon and be able to proceed with this work. This was stuff that would have been done by now, had the moratorium not come into play. We presently do not have any wells in process for permitting to drill. And we would expect that to come in 2011.
Philip Dodge - Stanford Group Company: Unrelated on hedging, you seem to be doing a lot more than you were a few years ago, when you'd sort of reluctantly admit that you were hedging even though the company is much larger, and therefore, greater protected against risk then at that time, So I'm interested in the thinking of that?
G. Farris: Let me, then I'll have Roger. I think more of in terms of where we find ourselves, we have a absolute debt that is higher than what we had in the past. And if you look at our financials we're in the same with anyone else. I mean, they are oil dependent. We're 50% of it on the production side, 75% of our rate of revenues. We just bought a bunch of assets. We want to spend some money on. So what we looked at is to make sure that we could protect a capital budget in 2011 and also make sure we could pay down some debt, which is -- and we haven't found ourselves in that position in some time.
Roger Plank: I guess the only thing I'd add, Phil, is -- and hopefully obvious , we've got a tremendous inventory and things to do with all the acquisitions that we need, and so when you do ratchet up the debt and need to make progress there. What we don't want to have happen is do that to the detriment of being able to after the upside on these properties, while continuing with our base long-term company builder-type project. So this probably ought to be considered, to some extent, as you're right about our size, in some extent, ought to be considered as sort of a one-off for an unusual set of circumstances, where we want to both pay down debt, and also get after the upside of these properties.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Polak with Scotia Capital.
Mark Polak - Scotia Capital Inc.: Question for you on the Wheatstone, with the recent sales agreement you've signed just curious where that leaves you now, in terms of how much uncontracted gas there is? How many more deals to do and then are you looking at sanctioning decision, kind of late 2011 there?
G. Farris: With regard to the volumes, the Wheatstone project phase that we're involved in, about 5.83 million tons per annum is the gross size of facility. Apache's net share of that will be about 0.95 million tons per annum. To date, with the announced TEPCO and the KOGAS deal, we would have placed in the market about 0.75 million tons per annum or about almost 80% of the allowable throughput volume that we want to share. So that's a really good start. As far as the final investment decision, that's pretty much on track for a time line would lead us into probably summer time of 2011, early third quarter.
Mark Polak - Scotia Capital Inc.: On Egypt, similar rate just on Salam 5. Wondering where you guys are out there in terms of time.
G. Farris: We've completed the FEED studies this past quarter, at the end of the quarter. And we expect in the first quarter to enter into EPC contracts, that we're going through the process for the joint venture companies right now to select the vendors and do the corporate negotiations on the price. We expect that we've done sometime in those 120 days. We also started construction.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale.
John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch: What’s your unamortized property cost level on a dollar basis right now, post all the acquisitions?
John Crum: I don't know John, I have to get back to you after the call.
John Crum: With the Gulf of Mexico, I mean, we all hope that the BOEM works quickly, but in the event that they don't, will you just throttle back or would you accelerate with more on-shore type development for next year?
G. Farris: The one thing I will say is that we are certainly not out of opportunities in terms of the Permian Basin, in terms of Canada, in terms of Egypt. Our biggest challenge for 2011 is how we allocate the cash flow that we have. It's not in terms of looking for opportunity, it's more as making sure we spend money on the right opportunities. So the Gulf of Mexico, it wouldn't bother me -- I wouldn't like it because I think that's the wrong answer, the United States. I don't think -- we're not worrying about where we're going to put capital next year.
Roger Plank: I'm just mention, Thomas Chambers and I were talking about this earlier that when the guys in the regions submitted their request for capital, somewhere between $8 billion and $9 billion. So when we talk about $7 billion or 7-plus billion of capital. It's not because we don't have any more to do with this. There's lots more to do and that's really -- that number will probably go up in terms of what they could do as we do get our arms around the BP properties and the Mariner properties.
John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch: Normally, you talk about services costs, and we've heard many other companies kind of complain about the rise of frac costs, what are you seeing in your areas? And how are you managing, because you weren't vociferous this time, Steve?
G. Farris: You can't have $3.80 gas and have comps like we have them, not forever. And I have no idea about other's economics. It would be very difficult in our economics just to drill a horizontal gap well in the United States right now. And costs are a big component of that. And I will tell you, sooner or later that's going to change, that's got to change.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: The Hogshooters, is that near the Marmaton? Is that near the Des Moines? Where exactly is that in the...
Roger Plank: In the press release, we gave you the actual location of those two tests we did. But yes, there is Marmaton in the area and there's certainly, Granite Wash A, B and C as well. So the press release has the actual location.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: I was trying to get more of the -- where it's at in the play. Is it above the Marmaton?
Roger Plank: It's high in this section. This would be one of the shallower intervals in the section.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Did you ever give well costs? And if so, I might have missed it.
Roger Plank: On the Granite Wash wells?
David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Yes, the most recent wells.
Roger Plank: It depends, again, on the well. but we can spend somewhere in the $5 billion to $6 billion range, again, depending on the number of fracs, because that's really the key in these things, depends on when you put six fracs or 16 fracs.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Steve, you touched on this briefly, but if you think about the hurdle constraints for the next couple of years, get your program done, I mean, you said you have too many projects, but to get the program done, you want to get done. What's the biggest hurdles standing in way right now, as you see it?
G. Farris: Well, for the most part, it's all pretty well laid out. The real decision we're going to make frankly and we haven't even -- is much money we spend in the Horn River. Because if you -- we anticipate we will be ready for actually get six contracts on Kitimat, but we spent probably $370 million there this year, John?
John Crum: Yes.
G. Farris: And it was on purpose because we were really wanting to make sure from a reservoir standpoint that the reservoir's as good as what we thought it was. Obviously, we found out, it wasn't as good as we thought it was. And now it's a question of how do you balance your current capital against future opportunity. And that's going be one of the toughest things we're going to have to decide here in 2011.
David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: And there's a thing about program execution. It sounds like you have all equipment, the people, I guess, you added the people with the BP transaction, but you have the people, the equipment in place to get the program executed?
G. Farris: We're going to spend $6 billion in 2010. We spent quite a bit more than that, I think in 2008. So from a manpower standpoint, our organization can spend that. I can't emphasize enough the most important thing we have in front of us and the challenge is how we allocate the cash flow that we generate, because that is key to making sure this -- we take advantage of what we bought.
John Crum: One challenge we got on the Permian on the BP property is these properties weren't for sale 30 days before basically we got to them. So they weren't all put in pretty packages and subdata is an issue, and it is going to take us a little bit of time to get our arms around exactly what the opportunity set looks like. So we've got some data challenges, but we're turning into it and we'll get after that fairly shortly.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sachin Shah, with CapStone Global Markets.
Sachin Shah - ICAP: Just want to get an update on the shareholder vote for Mariner on the 10th. Just kind of anticipated timing of close, thereafter?
Roger Plank: I think that question was about an update on the vote of the Mariner deal. And with not getting into specifics, I think...
G. Farris: I'm not sure we can answer this question. Right now, we've got about 45% of the vote in that I understand, and you'd have to be...
Sachin Shah - ICAP: Just to clarify I wanted to find out the closing of the transaction after shareholder vote.
G. Farris: It is immediate. As soon as the shareholder vote is counted and it's official, we will then own Mariner Energy.
Sachin Shah - ICAP: You've announced a lot of transactions this second half of the year. I just wanted to find out, as far as pipeline, going forward, are you going to be as kind of aggressive as you've been thus far?
G. Farris: In terms of the acquisition pipeline, I think, we're going to kind of slow down here a little bit. Frankly, we don't plan acquisitions. We never have. One of them was very fortuitous for us, obviously, the biggest one we did. But in terms of going forward, we had a pretty good asset base then, and I think, we have a truly formidable asset base now. So we're out there looking to grow just to grow.
Sachin Shah - ICAP: You mentioned earlier about the stimulus, being a positive kind of tailwind for oil prices. How does that kind of influence your thinking about getting or acquiring opportunistic assets or assets on a opportunistic basis?
Roger Plank: Can you repeat the question? I'm sorry, we're having trouble hearing you.
Sachin Shah - ICAP: So you mentioned earlier in the call how the stimulus from the government is probably somewhat of a tailwind in relation to oil prices and helping oil prices kind of move higher. And so kind of that train of thought how does that process allow you to kind of think about acquisitions and acquiring assets going forward.
G. Farris: I might just comment that my mind hasn't really gone to that yet. Because we do as we have indicated -- we got to make a dent in our debt. And we also have plenty on our plate from an investment standpoint. And I also, Apache haven't been around for 50-plus years. You don't want to jinx this thing by counting on it. So we start to look at it day-to-day, and every day that goes by is another day that we pay down a little more debt and put ourselves in a position ultimately where maybe we could be back on that trail. But I don't think we look at that as imminent but clearly at this price. Our internal price forecast that we're using is $70 on oil. So anything above that looks like gravy at this stage.
Operator: There are no further questions. Presenters, do you have any closing remarks?
Thomas Chambers: I just want to say thank you for joining us today. If you got any further questions, I'll be in my office after the call. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Apache Corp. First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's presentation will be hosted by Mr. Tom Chambers, Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor Relations. Mr. Chambers, please go ahead.
Thomas Chambers: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for the Apache Corp. First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. On today's call, we'll have four speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will lead off; followed by John Crum, our Co-Chief Operating Officer and President North America; Rod Eichler, our Co-Chief Operating Officer and President International; and Roger Plank, our President.  We have again prepared a detailed supplemental data package for your use, which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discussed such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or costs incurred. This data package can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financialdata.  Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions, and no assurance can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
G. Farris: Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Apache took important steps forward during the first quarter on three fronts, operationally, financially and strategically. And I'd first like to go over on the operations front and mention two highlights. Our Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil development projects in Australia have now achieved maximum production ahead of what we forecasted for the year. This is an important step forward in the delivery of the large and visible pipeline of organic growth projects in our international region.  In the North America, we ramped up the development of two large resource plays, the Horn River and the Granite Wash. We're going to drill over 60 gross wells this year in these two plays and expect to exit the year with net production of around 175 million a day. The Granite Wash is a liquid rich relative to most other large resource plays in North America, which gives big impact on economics. It's also differentiated by the acreage position we hold because it is primarily held by production.  In the Horn River, the quality of the rock and the development efficiencies certainly differentiates it. We can achieve those through large drilling pads on continuous ground acreage. In addition, as we progress our Kitimat LNG project, our goal is to give Horn River access to international LNG markets. These are just a couple of the highlights on the operations side, and Rod and John will go over more on this as we go, which is really shows that organic growth engine is stronger than it's ever been.  Going into 2010, we truly expected first quarter to be slow relative to the sequence of being of the quarters and production growth to accelerate from there and that's exactly what you see reflected on our numbers. Production ramped up throughout the quarter with March actual production coming in at 608,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day compared to our average for the quarter of 585,000 barrels a day. And we consider our 5% to 10% organic growth production outlook remains unchanged.  Secondly, on the financial front, the highlights really is that we have the best quarter since 2008, both in terms of earnings and cash flow. This has been driven by our portfolio balance, and I can't say enough how important it is for our portfolio to be balanced between oil and gas, and then within gas, to have a good mix of both North American and international gas. Not only it's an important but frankly, at our size, it's pretty much impossible to replicate for companies that did not make that balanced growth choices that we've made over the last several years in getting to this position.  And thirdly on the strategic front, we have taken three very important steps so far in 2010. A merger with Mariner Energy, which we announced after the quarter closed, will give Apache a new growth platform in the deepwater. Mariner gives us critical mass, experience and opportunities set that we want in this area and Apache's resources will enhance the value creation potential of this platform.  In addition, Mariner gives us a rich opportunity inventory in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf and also in the Permian Basin. The asset fit is excellent. The cultural fit is outstanding. And we're working diligently with Mariner's team to progress the merger and are very much looking forward to welcoming them officially onboard as Apache.  Separately, the Devon offshore property transaction gives us yet another high-quality inventory set in the core region, with very attractive returns and frankly, I can't say that we know of anyone that can generate the reserves and value better than we can. The third strategic development that took place during the quarter that Apache became operator is the Kitimat LNG facility in British Columbia, Canada. We've discussed that opportunity with you on our earnings call in February. But I'd note that just like Deepwater, LNG is a big step forward for Apache. It enables us to monetize very large gas resources, at LNG prices, which are generally linked to crude oil prices and gives us a large stable production and cash profile to complement our portfolio.  Instead of following the pack, we certainly picked our own timing and direction in taking each of these steps. Looking back, I can reminisce going into Egypt in 1995, going into the North Sea in 2003 and going into Australia in 1993. All were important steps for us. And all of them were very much against the sector consensus at the time but which have created great value for our shareholders. And we're confident that the steps that we've taken in the first quarter will be looked back on in the same vein, and will provide meaningful long-term value for our shareholders.  And with that, I'd like to turn it over to John Crum who will discuss North America.
John Crum: Thank you, Steve. North American production averaged 276,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, down 4% from the fourth quarter 2009. Downtime associated with extreme weather in Canada and third-party held platform and pipeline downtime issues in the Gulf Coast and Central regions were the primary factors. The ramp up of drilling operation, started in the first quarter after very low activity level in 2009, will arrest that drop for the second quarter.  The Gulf Coast region production for the first quarter averaged just under 119,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Production gains of almost 6,000 barrels equivalent were experienced from additional hurricane repairs and resumption of the service of the Sea Robin Pipeline. However, these gains were offset by natural declines and again, the third-party host platform and pipeline issues during the quarter.  The first quarter drilling program in the Gulf Coast has given us a nice start for 2010. We drilled 19 gross wells, of which 14 were successful. Four of those successful wells were exploratory and are now in evaluation and developmental planning stages. Two LLOG-operated Mississippi Canyon 199 wells successfully tested two adjacent fault blocks at our Mandy prospect, and penetrated net oil pay of 161 feet and 109 feet respectively at approximately 6,500-foot PVD. We are now evaluating subsea development plans for these wells and would expect production by mid 2011 with initial rates of around 6,000 barrels per day from each well. Apache has working interest of 15% in this field and Mariner Energy has 35% working interest in the discovery.  In addition, we were successful with two tests of the N6 M [ph] at our Boomerang Prospect that main pass 308, where we identified 12 feet and 30 feet of net oil pay in the N6 M [ph] in our number one and number one sidetrack wells respectively. Regionally, the N6 M [ph] well is quite prolific with recoveries in the range of 1 million barrels of oil from 10-foot pay sections.  We are currently mobilizing a rig to drill in a price of well and mainpass 309 to further delineate the reservoir and confirm our platform location for development plans. Initial rates are expected to be around 800 barrels per day per well, with the support of six wells development. First production would be expected in the first half of 2011. Apache operates this bill with 100% working interest.  Other successful drilling of two wells, the Grand Isle 41 and South Pass 75, as well as the new well at High Island 129, and three new wells on to our producers will have additional production volumes for the second quarter.  In our Central Region, production averaged 34,600 barrels equivalent per day, down 4% from last quarter. Third-party pipeline downtime and delays in completion of new wells were responsible for the decline. The third-party downtime issues resolved in our backlog of completions being worked off. We expect production to be up by more than 3,000 barrels equivalent in the second quarter.  As most of you know, horizontal drilling with multiple stage frac stimulations has really improved the potential of the tight formations we typically target in the country United States. Our Central Region controls roughly 1 million gross acres, most of which is held by production. This has provided us with an excellent platform from which we actively and efficiently explore. We've been testing various geologic targets across the region to identify the most prospective acreage for horizontal application.  Since late last year, the region has tested eight separate horizontal pay intervals within 20 wells over hundreds of square miles. More than a dozen more horizontal formation tests are planned this year. As plans are verified, leasing efforts have commenced. In the past year, 36,000 new gross acres have been leased with 16,000 of those acres being leased in the first quarter of 2010. The Central Region spud 23 wells in the first quarter, of which 13 were horizontal. The region's most active program continues to be the Granite Wash in Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. You're all aware that the Granite Wash is a series of liquid-rich tech gas, which underlies some 4,000 square miles of the Anadarko Basin.  We've been active even in the decades and have only recently ramped up horizontal multi-frac operations. We have now drilled eight horizontal wells, five of which have been completed, as well as have already produced 4 bcf gas at 150,000 barrels of oil. The remaining three are now being completed. Meanwhile, we are expanding the drilling campaign and are currently operating six horizontal Granite Wash rigs. A seventh horizontal rig will be added as well as an additional vertical rig in May.  At the same time, we have another three rigs targeting other horizontal effects around the region. We are quite enthused about the results of our Cherokee formation activity in Western Oklahoma. For the past several years, Apache has been successful in acquiring acreage and drilling shallow Cherokee formation wells, primarily in Hartford County, Oklahoma, one of the oldest areas of the Anadarko Basin.  We drilled over 20 vertical oil wells with initial rates typically averaging 100 barrels per day. On those results, we have recently leased more than 11,000 acres and now control over 60,000 acres in the play. In the first quarter of 2010, we completed our first horizontal path in this play. The Rose Hill for 29H after 150 barrels of oil per day from a 38-foot, 100-foot lateral and has held up quite nicely, still producing over 120 barrels per day after two months.  Our second test, the Bentley 5-5H has to drill over 700 barrels a day from the 4,400-foot lateral and is still producing 530 barrels a day after six weeks. The region has identified more than 30 additional horizontal locations in this play and we expect to maintain at least one horizontal drilling rig in the play for the foreseeable future.  In East Texas, Apache has been active with two horizontal drilling rigs targeting Bossier Sands since late last year. The region has completed three horizontal tests today. The Folk 6H, that was this year. The Folk 6H tested for 9.2 million cubic feet of gas per day. The Moody T-7H [ph] tested for 9.4 million cubic feet of gas per day. And while the Folk 9H tested for a very strong rate of 15.5 million cubic feet gas per day. The Moody 2-8H is currently testing out their frac, an early indications that it will be the strongest well to date.  As of this morning, it's already flowing at more than 15 million cubic feet of gas per day while still recovering frac water at more than 2,000 barrels per day. We're on a 100% of Moody lease in the lease and 77% of the 12 place [ph].  Our new Permian Region is operating independently after the year end spun out from our Central Region. We've been actively recruiting staff from both inside and outside Apache and expect to be fully operational from our newly leased office space in Midland by early July. Permian production averaged 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent within 1% of the prior quarter. We expect production to be up slightly for the second quarter. The Permian region drilling program got off to a fast start as well. We're currently operating five rigs, three in New Mexico and two in Texas. During the first quarter, the region drilled 51 wells targeting oil reservoirs in 11 different fields across Permian Basin. All 51 Wells are either completed and on production or will be completed in the near future.  As in the Central Region, application of horizontal well technology is having a significant impact on our plants. Importantly, we drilled two successful horizontal tests in all waterflood units. The Shafterlike [ph] 606-H well was drilled and completed in the San Andres with a fixed-stage frac stimulation and came on production at the initial rate of nearly 500 barrels of oil per day. The North McElroy 4025-H was drilled and completed in the Grayburg with an eight-stage frac stimulation and tested approximately 200 barrels of oil per day. Both wells initial rates and post-drill reserve estimates were higher than pre-drill estimates. Based on this success, follow-up locations are planned in both fields, where we will test longer laterals and more fracture stimulation stages.  We're very optimistic about the potential for horizontal drilling throughout the Permian Basin with additional wells planned at TSO South [ph] and Dean units in West Texas, as well as the monument area of southeast new Mexico. We expect to keep at least one horizontal rig working at the remainder of the year. We also expect to add two additional drilling rigs by the end of the second quarter to expand our traditional low risk bread-and-butter vertical oil well programs.  During the first quarter, the region also sanctioned Roberts CO2-enhanced recovery expansion and just signed an agreement with Kinder Morgan for the purchase of 38 bcf of CO2 over 10 years. CO2-enhanced recovery will be an important piece to the Permian Region business for a long time given our extensive holdings in the basin. We have already identified 26 of our fields with CO2 enhanced recovery potential.  In Canada, Canadian production averaged 68,000 barrels equivalent a day, down 5% from the fourth quarter. As mentioned earlier, extreme weather early in the year caused extensive freeze up across the region and was the primary reason for the drop. We are bringing on production from our winter drilling program and completion operations, which are expected to lead to a 6% increase for the second quarter. The majority of the impact of the Horn River activity will not become evident until the second half of the year.  Development drilling and our conventional business units totaled 42 wells resulting in 38 producers during the first quarter, with successful gas completions at Zama, Kaybob and Nevis. Oil drilling activity was focused on House Mountain where six new horizontal wells are producing over 1,100 barrels per day. Also an 18-well winter program in our Provost area has delivered good results including one well that tested over 500 barrels of oil per day at our proposed Battle River EOR [Enhanced Oil Recovery] project area.  Our Horn River activity continues to dominate Canadian operations with horizontal wells were drilled in the two island of late developed area during the quarter with four of the Apache operated 52 pan and three on enhanced and can operated 63 tape. In addition come Apache drilled through horizontal Wells in our ability area to hold expiring acreage. Drilling efficiencies that result in cost performance continued to improve with average drill times now at 19 days from the spud rig release and average drill cost at $3.7 million per well for about 7,200-foot of horizontal section.  Completion operations on the 16 Wells 70 K-Pad, which was drilled in 2009 commenced in January. We have just finished the amount of frac stimulation project associated with these wells this week. Over the past three and a half months, we have completed 274 frac stimulations on those 16 Wells, accounting more than 500 million barrels of water and an excess of 100 million pounds of sand. The project also involves conducting a huge micro-seismic acquisition program with 82 individual frac stages in over 19,000 individual micro seismic events mapped. This data will be used to optimize frac design, frac spacing and then well spacing on our future pads.  The first half 16 70-K came on stream on March 29 to start recovering frac load water, and we're now producing around 25 million a day from that pad. The ramp-up has been severely limited due to the space restrictions while the frac spread remain on location. We are presently demobilizing the frac equipment and would expect to have all 16 wells on production by early July.  Construction of the DeBolt water treatment facility ramped up in the first quarter and is expected to be completed in early May. While it is not available for our 70-K Pad program, utilization of this water supply will ultimately reduce the volumes of fresh water used for frac stimulation purposes and the associated costs for water transportation. Steve mentioned the Kitimat operation during the first quarter, we have now received feed proposals from four parties and we're under technical evaluation. We would expect to award fees sometime or the next month and a half, two months.  And that's all I have. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob Eichler.
Rodney Eichler: Thank you, John. During the first quarter, production from Apache's international operations was 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 2% increase over fourth quarter 2009. The production increase can be attributed to drilling successes in Egypt and successful commission of oil developments in Australia. In Egypt, net production was 151,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 5% from fourth quarter due to higher oil prices and lower recoverable costs resulting in lower cost recovery barrels. By contrast, gross fuel per day increased 3,000 barrels a day or 1% from 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 303,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.  Exploration activity continued stronger in the quarter with operations being conducted on five free seismic surveys representing nearly 3,000 square kilometers average. Oil activity increased during the quarter with a total of 48 wells, reaching total debt including 10 exploration wells. The region heads for the quarter with 20 after drilling rigs operating and the success rate for Apache-operated exploration wells was 67%.  Exploration appraisal drilling was largely focused in our expanding Faghur Basin oil play, where four plays tested in a combined rate of 12,000 barrels of oil per day and 10 billion cubic feet of gas per day from AEB reservoir. 18 well remain to drilled in the basin this year including non-exploration wells. Development of the Phiops field of the east end of Faghur Basin continued with Phiops-8 well, which encountered 124 net feet of pay and multiple AEB sands. The initial completion, AEB 3E sand tested at 4,500 barrels of oil per day and no water. Construction is during completion on the West Kalansha facility project, which will increase the export capacity of our Faghur Basin facilities from the current 11,000 barrels of oil per day to 20,000 barrels per day by midyear.  Extension of the Malaha accrual pipeline and completion of the chain of infrastructure upgrades will further produce Apache's Faghur Basin production capacity to 40,000 barrels of oil per day, which we should be able to fill up by year end. Notable drilling results were also achieved in the Jade field discovered by Apache in 2007 on a Matruh development lease. The Jade-8 well was completed in AEB 3E put on production this 10th of March. In its current report, the Salam gas plant at the rate of 3,100 barrels condensate per day and 32 million cubic feet of gas per day. The Jade-10 well is drilled in that quest of Jade structure and tested 3,100 barrels of oil per day with no water from the AEB 3E. Additional field wells are planned in 2010 to accelerate this oil development. To date, the Jade field has produced 47 Bcf and 4.5 million barrels of oil and condensate and presently produces 107 million cubic feet of gas per day and 12,000 barrels of oil and condensate per day.  Apache has 100% contract interest for all the previously referenced wells.  In Australia, net production was 61,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 40% increase over fourth quarter and double the rate for first quarter of 2009. Gas production increased by 1% from fourth quarter while oil production nearly tripled. The substantial increase in net oil production from 9,900 barrels of oil per day to 27,000 barrels per day was due to successful commissioning of the of Van Gogh and Pyrenees development projects. Their region also benefited from the absence of cyclones in the first quarter compared to three cyclones and storm production eruptions for the same period of 2009.  At the Van Gogh oil project, which Apache operates for 52.5% working interest, the Ningaloo Vision FPSO arrived on location and following a five-week commissioning period, the field commenced production on February 13. Well performance has been excellent with oil wells tested above 10,000 barrels of oil per day on Cleo [ph]. Production peaked at 72,200 barrels of oil per day gross in March, and averaged 66,000 barrels of oil per day gross or 34,700 barrels a day net in the last week of the quarter. To date, the field has produced 3.4 million barrels of oil or 1.8 million barrels net.  Nearby, BHP Billiton operated Pyrenees FPSO development in which Apache has a 28.6% working interest commenced production February 24. Production ramped up quickly to 90,000 barrels a day gross from the seven WA-42 L permit wells with six wells remain to be completed on the adjacent WA-43 L permit in which Apache has a 31.5% working interest. To date, Pyrenees field has produced 4.4 million barrels of oil gross and 1.3 million barrels net for Apache. These high initial rates for both fields are essentially flush production as we commission the facilities and we expect the region's net oil production to average 40,000 to 50,000 barrels of oil per day for the year.  Work is progressing in our Devil Creek Reindeer development project in which Apache is the operator with 55% working interest. Gas plant in both Earthworks were sort of completed in the first quarter and several works commenced. The first shipment of the Thailand fabricated gas plant hyperact modules arrived on site and installation in progress. The onshore pipeline from the beach crossing to the gas plant and the horizontal directional-drilling operations on the beach was started. Fabrication of the Reindeer Wellhead Platform deck is underway in China. The project is on schedule for postproduction in third quarter 2011. Also during the first quarter, four Apache-operated wells reached TD yield in two trend exploration dry holes and two successful appraisal wells on Australia's North Sea shell. The Julimar Southwest 1 and Southwest 2 how much Apache has a 65% working interest were drilled in a single surface location to confirm productivity of the Mungaroo formation in the southern part of the Julimar horse block. Both wells are part of the Julimar-Brunello development component of the Chevron-operated Wheatstone LNG project.  In the North Sea, production averaged 58,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 2% for the fourth quarter. 32,000 barrels of oil per day average for the quarter was added to new drilling where we lost 1,800 barrels a day from mechanical failures, unplanned events in normal times. At the end of the quarter, seven development wells and five pilot holes were drilled and completed. Notably, the Forties Alpha 15A 53W [ph] in the Forties Charlie 24 C - 44 Y [ph] development wells tested 3,031 barrels of oil per day, respectively. The field development plan for the mall field, a new field using oil discovery made by Apache in the fourth quarter has been proved by the Department of Energy and Climate Change. First oil expected late in the second quarter of 2010. The field has qualified as a small field development yielding up to 75 million pounds earning a supplement corporation tax breaks as well as exemption from the petroleum revenue tax.  In Argentina, net production was 39,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down 8% from the fourth quarter. The normal decline as well as mechanical and other related downtime in Neuquén fields pushed oil production down while gas production separate from lower than normal residential seasonal demand and lower demand by power generation customers from increased hydroelectric power capability, availability all result in increased gas, injection and shutting gas wells throughout the first quarter. In total, we reinjected close to 4 million cubic feet of gas per day net more than in the first quarter compared to previous quarter.  Regions shallow [ph] program however was very successful in the first quarter, with 10 wells drilled with no dry hole adding net reserves is 2.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In the shallow drilling program in the Neuquén Basin three successful wells were drilled at a gross production of 5.3 million cubic feet of gas per day and 335 barrels of oil per day from Centenario and Cuyo reservoirs. All three wells are drilled at depths of only 4,000 feet. An additional 16 Wells are planned for this year. Also the Neuquén Basin, four successful wells are drilled as part of the Gas Plus program. Three wells in EFO field have been completed in the Lajas the depth 11,500 feet and our production can combined rate of 5.9 million cubic feet of gas per day or 108 barrels of currency per day after multizone stimulated completions. If fourth well, the EFO 109, encountered 328 feet of net pay in the Lajas, it is being completed and frac is stimulated in six zones. Those are currently cleaning up after frac of the first three zones at a rate of 3.1 million cubic feet of gas per day. Based on the quality of paying [ph] and the results of the first three zone the EFO 109 is expected to produce over 500 million cubic feet of gas per day and 125 barrels of condensate per day.  Eight additional wells are planned in EFO field to develop gas volumes for the Gas Plus contracts that is currently being negotiated to provide 15 million cubic feet of gas per day at a price of $5 per million BTU on January 1, 2011. 10 additional wells in AC and Ronaco fields will also be drilled this year to support the Gas Plus program. Apache operates the reference Neuquén Basin wells and fields with 100% working interest.  Now let's turn the presentation over to Roger Plank for the finance.
Roger Plank: Thanks, Rod. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to finish up with a few quick notes from a financial perspective. Apache turned in a standout first quarter setting, the stage for what is the makings of a truly exceptional year. Earnings of $705 million or $2.08 per share were 21% higher than the prior quarter and our highest since third quarter of '08. Adjusted for the impact of FX on our deferred tax balances, earnings totaled $712 million or $2.10 a share. Cash flow from operations for us $1.5 billion also for the first time since third quarter of '08. Apache's substantial oil and liquid production base was the primary driver behind our results. Highland liquids represented half of our equivalent production but generated nearly 3/4 of revenue, and are principally responsible for our revenue rising $118 million sequentially to $2.7 billion.  Long before the current industries stampede began oil exposure, Apache took deliberate steps to achieve a balanced production mix. As a result, we're already benefiting from a current 20 to 1 multiple in the price of oil versus gas. And we are ramping up activity on the oil side of our portfolio. In the first quarter, for example, Van Gogh and Pyrenees enabled Apache's lower production to rise 3% sequentially, nearly offsetting a 4% temporary decline in gas production. I would note that absent the impact of higher prices had on both price-sensitive volumes in Egypt and to a lesser extent in Canada, on a production volumes, would've been up slightly and pretty much spot on our first quarter plan. A few quick comments on costs, cash costs excluding taxes other than income, came in at $11.89 per barrel of oil equivalent, impacted by slightly lower production. Rising future productions should drive us toward our goals to match 2009's average of $11.25 per boe.  You're maybe wondering about the potential impact of our recently announced transactions on 2010. Because it so much depends on exactly when the transactions closed. The precise impact is difficult to measure but here's some broad indicators. Absent the exercise of preferential purchase rate, which covers some 7,500 barrels equivalent per day, Apache is picking up 19,000 barrels equivalent per day from Devon and another 63,000 with Mariner. A combined 82,000 equivalent barrels per day represents 14% of Apache's first quarter worldwide production. With respect to the financial 2010 impact, assuming Devin closes in early June and Mariner late in the third quarter, 2010 average volumes should rise around 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 4% to 5% from these transactions alone. Now this is over and above our earlier production growth target of 5% to 10% growth pre-acquisitions.  I would note that for the last couple of years, Apache chose to build cash rather than pursue transactions of size in what was generally considered a profiting market. Net cash was in fact pent-up growth potential that is now being put to work and will benefit all key per share metrics over the next several years. While we potentially took up 14% more production, share count rises just 5%, resulting in accretion to per-share earnings, cash flow, production and reserves in the first full year of ownership.  The bottom line is our outlook for growth is excellent. I would also note that in our two recent deals, about 60% of combined production is gas. Approximately 60% of the revenue is generated from oil and liquids. There's also a deep inventory of future development projects as well as exploration prospects that are oil.  One final note on our balance sheet, while the combined transactions totaled $5 billion, our financial flexibility remains intact. Approximately $2 billion at consideration is equity and we will also tap a significant portion of our $2.1 billion of cash balances to close these deals. By year-end, debt cash should be below 25% and cash balances above $1 billion, leaving us in excellent position to continue to carry out Apache's growth strategy.  Steve?
G. Farris: Thank you, Roger. I'd like to sum up what I think were the three main messages from all the information that we shared with you on this call.  First, we had a very good quarter operationally. As you heard mentioned few times Van Gogh and Pyrenees have ramped up. Our organic growth engine as strong as ever and our organic growth production's expectations for the year remain at 5% to 10%.  Secondly, we have had a very good quarter from a financial perspective, with the highest earnings and cash flow since 2008. We achieved this in spite of a weak price environment from North American gas and it's because of our portfolio, which is really a central part of our strategy and a key differentiating factor for most of our peers.  And third, we certainly took very important strategic steps during the quarter. You got further omissions that are a little, profitable long-term growth our shareholders. We picked our own timing and direction. And we're very excited about the growth and value creation potential by the Mariner merger, the Devon offshore acquisition and our Kitimat LNG project.  And with that, we're ready to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Philip Dodge with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.
 Philip Dodge: On the Horn River, you mentioned some metrics growth that are rig release average cost per oil. I didn't hear fracturing stages or EURs but you said you a lot of the cash but I didn't hear?
G. Farris: No, I probably -- I didn't give you the map on it. We did 274 fracs on 16 wells, so that comes up to just over 17 fracs per well. We did as many as 22 stages on individual wells. And the length of the horizontals that we're typically targeting now are somewhere in the range of 2,200 meters or 7,200 feet.
 Philip Dodge: Anything on EURs as you see is the most recently in decline rates?
G. Farris: We're still early to tell you anything about the decline rates here because we're still unloading water. We couldn't really bring these things on. We're just flowing through test separator equipment on location. We've got -- we're still running with a number that we believe we're going to be able to drain an excess of 10 bcf per well on all of these.
Operator: Your second question today comes from Leo Mariani with RBC Capital.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets Corporation: Just a quick follow up on the Horn River here, I think you guys give a well cost there, but I don't think I heard it right? What was your average well cost up there now?
G. Farris: We just gave you the drilling costs, Leo. The drilling costs were now at $3.7 million per well but that's on considerably extended lateral length to. You've heard me talk and pass about spending $10 million per well. We averaged around $11 million per well in this program. We were not able to get our new water plant on production in time to do these wells and that's why I believe it will add another million to our total costs. The real key here and I mentioned over tons of paper for here is we continued to that stages as we go forward and of course instead of using up some of our ability to reduce the costs.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets Corporation: You talked about experimenting with the horizontals in the Permian Basin here. Just trying to get a sense of how long you guys been doing that? And how much your acreage do you think is prospective and what types of improvements are you seeing and economics versus critical drilling for this play.
G. Farris: I'd say we really just getting started in the Permian Basin. There a number of players who have been doing some horizontal drilling certainly in the Southeast, New Mexico and in far West Texas for the past year, year and a half. And we really good guy getting started. These two wells I talked about were especially important because for drilling needs to wield of water that you do so that to get those kinds of results and those kind of reservoirs is pretty impressive. We would've expected to have so much water coming back in a typical well there that will create some new problems for us but that's going to lead us to try a lot of different things across the nation over the rest of this year.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets Corporation: Any further estimates as opposed to how much of benefit you're seeing here? Do you think you're getting to through funds back for the boss and verticals in some of these fields or?
G. Farris: Well again, a little early on, I only got two of them completed. We would be getting more than twice as much from these wells if our estimates hold up.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets Corporation: You guys also talked a little bit about East Texas doing some closure wells, some kind of a hot topic in the industry layaway. So the serious how much acreage this you think this is expected other.
G. Farris: We have a fairly modest position in these assets where we continue in that in areas that we're comfortable with. So again that's not our hottest area but we're getting pretty worked up about it because we got some great results out of our recent programs and knowledge and hope.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets Corporation: It sounds like you got five completion spirit you talked about some kids with all five wells took any kind of sense of kind of what these average rates are on these wells when you drill.
G. Farris: I have to give you average rates but I would say we we're averaging somewhere around $10 million.
Operator: And we'll go next to Judy Delgado with Alpine Associates.
Judy Delgado: Wanted to know whether companies have that the situation going on in the Gulf of Mexico and the newly announced administration's plans to be a little more stringent in their efforts to help. Do you have any thoughts on that?
Roger Plank: I think it's tragic that we have the loss of lives in the Gulf and I think its a little early to try to figure out what the problem was. Certainly, it's going to be an area of a lot of attention and I hope we come up with something that is workable and safe and environmentally friendly.
Judy Delgado: Is the company experiencing any shutdowns now? Are you planning for any shutdowns in the future?
Roger Plank: Well we don't have any shutdowns right now and it's going to depend on the direction that I assume you are speaking to this scale it's up for direction, we're not in danger to those amounts any of the spills reaching any of our existing production facilities. That's a wait-and-see.
Operator: And we'll go next to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: I want to see if you can touch on that more on the cost inflation or lack of it as you go through your major areas and maybe on short-term site in terms of is some be on shore drilling and completion activities and also anything your seeing on the steel pricing processing when you think about the costs of LNG extensions in Australia and in Canada?
Roger Plank: I'll let John talk about North America and then I might talk a little bit about overall what we're seeing on costs. I would start off from a generalization. I think personally, I think it's premature to extrapolate cost increases that we've seen in the first quarter throughout the year. Winter is difficult for us in Canada and unfortunately, it's difficult for us in the central region because we've got one of the more severe freezes that we've had through that part of our portfolio in the first quarter. So a lot of costs with respect to activities to start production again is part of those costs and the other thing is to be honest with you, our production was down a little bit and one of the major culprits was because we are in a CS3 a production sharing agreement in Egypt and the bedside of is all prices go up come in the downside of it is we see less production which cost us about 5000 barrels a day in Egypt. And gross operated was actually up. But overall, I don't think the cost side of it is going to get out of line. On the steel prices, that's certainly going to have an impact and I'm sure everyone's over the steel prices are going up. And we'll just have too wait and see what the impact of it is on those budget.
John Crum: I don on that steel costs, I guess I'd like to think there's a positive tied to that but all in only indicates increased demand so hopefully, we can get some strength in prices to support some of that activity but obviously, that's something we do have to watch break also because it has a big impact on virtually all of our business.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: On the Granite Wash going forward basis, for the next batch of gross, what are your expectations for percent gas versus percent NDLs versus?
John Crum: I have to do the math call Brian. Can I just call you back would that?
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Are you concentrating more on the Atoka relative to some of the where the oil comes on?
John Crum: We're concentrating on higher liquid yields as we at testing a lot of different zones year but obviously, we're looking at the highest liquid yields the hardest.
Operator: And we'll go next to Doug Leggett with Bank of America.
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: Can you give us any better feel for where your CapEx may go this year, partly obviously the increase but also when you take a cut of the additional assets are going to have in the portfolio? Any guidance would be appreciated.
Roger Plank: Could you first about that way maybe?
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: Your capital expenditure guidance for the current year, how is that likely to change going how do you expect your capital expenditure to trend over the balance of this year and can you give a details?
Roger Plank: In terms of our overall capital budget, we've indicated before dividend, before the Mariner acquisition or merger, that we would be a little north of $6 million. And I think what you're going to see is from an activity level, our acquisition forecast for Devon, we had about $100 million of capital we're 10. Depending on what kind of opportunities we see them increase but we can generate about $285 million worth of cash out of that acquisition. With respect to Mariner, they have probably won't close that until September issue or later. They have a capital budget of about $550 million internally, which they're going to spend. So from our standpoint, which you'll see out of Apache, is not a significant increase from the acquisitions. Now depending on what prices do, reallocate capital quarters and we put a few more rigs to work starting in the second quarter than we've had running so you might see a little upward movement on our overall capital program.
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: So in materials.
Roger Plank: Not in the present time to.
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: It that could jump over to Egypt, can you give us some sense as to how you see your production play through the balance of this year? Obviously call there's a lot of moving parts but it all pretty it was we're right now, how would the trajectory play out as you move through 2010?
Roger Plank: Gross production gross gas production will soon about of the year because we are facilities limited with existing gas processing facilities although if you remedy debt by 2012 with additional pipeline construction. On the oil side combines to pay the continued growth in the quarter to quarter because we can't handle more oil as you so we have substantial interest forecast oil on gross oil beginning later this quarter from our opposite is project and by year end, we expect that to double again.
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: And from the price standpoint, if we stay static, that's where we're today. I think our March numbers were about 9,000 barrels per day net so when we broke for gross the number you saw average for March, you're going to grow from there.
Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch: Typically you guys tend to spend your cash flow just on a regional basis. I'm trying to think where that capital expenditure program in Egypt can take you if I heard you correctly, it sounded like you're going to drill about 19 exploration wells. I thought you were going to go this year if you could just give us.
G. Farris: That's 19 exploration wells in the area. The total exploration was about 33 wells.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Eric Marzucco with Dominick and Dominick.
Eric Marzucco: As far as what you commented before about the recent developments in the Gulf having no frac on the deal comedy think it will affect timing any way, shape, or form?
G. Farris: Now, I wouldn't expect it to. I have no reason to believe that we'd expect it to.
Eric Marzucco: That changes nothing as far as commitment common desire commenting on your end I assume?
G. Farris: No, none, whatsoever.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brian Lively with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Brian Lively - Tudor Pickering Holt: In the Permian Basin, your horizontal drilling is pretty interesting but I was just interested in sort of a concept of approaching old water flood units with horizontal wells. The cost of their try to find lower permeable decisions that have been swept, or verticals or is there something else to it?
John Crum: That's the primary answer. A lot of those reservoirs out there even under secondary recovery somewhere in the range of 35% to 40% so that's you're exactly right. That's what we're trying to get done has access reserves have never been touched.
G. Farris: We have a huge position with respect to specially water flows and the PUCO twos is done more that we have 26 different projects that we're looking at for CO2 so it's really at the present time, it's a somewhat of an experiment but if it works, you have a tremendous acreage position and full water potential to really ramp up production.
Brian Lively - Tudor Pickering Holt: Switching gears to Australia, Pyrenees and Van Gogh, what are your volume limitations? I'm interested in as an oil volume water to total fluids and is there any upside as perhaps the water cut is lower than you expect?
G. Farris: There's a specific limitation on both the vessels, the thirties vessels come of the larger than what we have at Van Gogh. I think we're capped out at about, the Van Gogh little over about 65,000 barrels of oil per day capability. I forgot the number over 30 some it's a 100,000 barrels of oil per day is their capacity. In the second part of your question was what?
Brian Lively - Tudor Pickering Holt: I was really just looking forward from the standpoint of total fluid handling versus oil volumes, I think you answered it.
G. Farris: It also has of a water and to date, we've seen no water in the first two months of production, which is really good news.
Operator: And we have no more questions at this time.
Thomas Chambers: Okay, thank you. For other questions, I'll be in my office after the call.
Operator: This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Apache Corporation fourth quarter and year end 2009 earnings conference call. Today's presentation will be hosted by Mr. Tom Chambers, Vice President Corporate Planning and Investor Relations. Mr. Chambers, please go ahead. 
Tom Chambers: Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us for Apache Corporation's fourth quarter and year end 2009 earnings conference call. On today’s call we’ve taken a little bit different approach from previous calls and intend on using our remarks to provide additional context for the 2009 results and 2010 year ahead.  Therefore in order to allow you to focus more on the comments, we’ve prepared a detailed supplemental data package and placed it on our website. This supplemental information plus the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or costs incurred can be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financialdata. Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions and no assurance can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is included on our website at the same URL.  On today's call we'll have four speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. Steven Farris will kick off the session and he's our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by John Crum our Co-Chief Operating Officer and President of North America; then Rod Eichler our Co-Chief Operating Officer and President International; then concluding with Roger Plank our President.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Steven. 
Steven Farris : Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us for Apache 2009 year end results earnings call. The year 2009 was obviously a difficult year for the industry due to the sharp drop in commodity prices, and the weakened economy.  Going into the year Apache decided to reduce our investments to ensure that we lived within our means, without need to tap the capital markets or dilute our portfolio. So we ended the year with growing 53% fewer wells than we did the year before and investing 40% less capital. We have ramped up activity somewhat toward the end of the year but we really won’t start seeing the benefits of that until in 2010. So in that context we’re very satisfied that the Apache’s team managed to increase production by 9% for 2009. We came out of the year with more cash on our balance sheet than we had going into it. And we did this without diluting our shareholders’ ownership of our upstream portfolio.  On the cost side our cost management efforts during the year were successful. We managed to reduce lifting costs for BOE by 20% during 2009. And overall we had strong cash flow from operations after a dismal first start. We generated over $5 billion and had adjusted earnings of about $1.9 billion.  This performance is a testament to the strength of our team and the quality of our portfolio around the world. Every Apache employee is focused on maximizing value and growth on every property. And this is easy to claim but very difficult to actually do. It involves an awful lot of geoscience and optimization work but every location, pre-completion, work overs, all add to real value and real growth and you’ll see that in our 2009 performance.  I’d also like to highlight that in 2009 we replaced 101% of our production improved reserve terms from drilling and modest acquisitions despite growing less than 50% of the wells we drilled in the previous year. And our finding costs for all of Apache globally was about $16.00 per BOE. And the way we really look at that number is internally, its about $13.86 per BOE for all regions excluding the Gulf Coast. And the reason is is that Gulf Coast have a very unique profile, a high cost high cash flow business. To try to give you a little more flavor for that, at the end of the year we ran the full project life internal rate of return on our Gulf of Mexico crude reserve which came out to be almost 30% on a before tax basis.  Now that number includes all cash flows from the time we entered the properties and the future cash flows at strict prices. It included $1.1 billion of net hurricane costs, and it also includes $1.5 billion of future capital costs. Doesn’t give any credit for new reserves we will continue to add on these properties.  So in the aggregate it means we generated an internal rate of return of almost 30% on a before tax basis on more than $10 billion of capital. If you look at it on a net present value basis, excess of 10% is $7.4 billion. And that’s why our Gulf of Mexico portfolio is a great source of value generation for our shareholders.  We also took meaningful strategic steps in 2009 including our entry into the global LNG business by our participation in the Wheatstone project in Australia. And also becoming the operator of the potential Kitimat LNG export project in Canada.  LNG provides decades of stable cash flow which represents a very interesting contribution to our portfolio of assets for the long-term. We have received many inquiries since we became operator of the Kitimat LNG project in January and I think all I’ll say at this stage is that it’s a very promising concept and we believe it could work and be very impactful but at this point we’re simply conducting a [feed] study. We have a long way to go before Kitimat potentially becomes a real export asset on the ground.  That sums up everything I’d like to say about 2009 and its 2010 that matters, so I’d like to outline what we’re planning to do for the year and what it means to us. We’ve been a growth company for 55 years and we focus on long-term growth projects, balanced across our commodities and geographies.  We don’t follow the latest market fashion because we found that they tend to change and we’re better off just sticking to fundamental principals of profitability and balance. In 2010 its going to be no different. We expect another year of production growth in 2010. Our international regions have continued to deliver a visible pipeline of growth projects and deep drilling inventories.  In North America the aggregate will have another stable year similar in 2009 while our new growth plays [inaudible] and gather some momentum. Overall we expect Apache’s net production for 2010 to grow between 5% and 10% over 2009 and due to project and activity scheduling we anticipate the first quarter of 2010 will be slightly up over the fourth quarter of 2009 and then it will accelerate after the first quarter.  As you’ll hear from John and Rod, we are executing on a broad and strong portfolio of plays across our global acreage but will sustain our growth and returns for the long-term. The 662 net wells we’re planning to drill this year will advance 32 development plays and 25 exploration plays across our portfolio.  To give you a piece of data, the development drilling we do in 2010 alone will contribute 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent net to Apache by 2011. The basis for this growth portfolio is simple, the right critical mass of highly prospective acreage around the world much of which it is held by production, a good organization with real value and delivery focus and a creative application of technology.  With that let me pass it to John who will discuss North America.
John Crum : Thank you Steven, at the onset of 2009 Apache adopted a cautious approach to North American expenditures in order to allow time for costs to adjust downward to levels reflecting the challenging commodity price environment. Overall we [kept] 2009 investment in North America by near 50% from the 2008 level.  We are very proud of the fact that our regional teams were able to hold production essentially flat, down 1.3% while drilling 61% fewer wells in 2009 than in 2008. While I won’t suggest it will be available every year, our large base of HBC properties provided our teams with many opportunities to optimize production from existing wells.  This production level was also achieved without any meaningful contribution from new growth plays such as the Horn River and the Granite Wash which we will be ramping up significantly in 2010 and beyond. You will note fourth quarter North American gas production was down 4.4% from third quarter.  That’s mostly due to severe weather in Canada where we had widespread freeze up problems. Just a few of the more important 2009 highlights include the start up of [inaudible] in May. Eight months later the two well field is still producing 78 million a day gross, that’s 31 million net to Apache.  The Horn River activity ramp up we drilled a total of 42 gross wells but only completed four. The four wells were completed last summer and continue to produce in excess of four million cubic feet per day each and they [inaudible] our reserves for awhile in excess of 10 BCF for each well. We hold a 50% working interest in that activity with partner in [Canada]. The horizontal Granite Wash activity, our first operated Granite Wash well the Hostetter 1-23H in Wheeler County, Texas, came on production in late September and continues to produce at a gross rate of 9.5 million cubic feet of gas per day with 600 barrels of liquids. Addition drilling continues confirming the potential of our interest covering over 200,000 acres across the play.  And then finally the acquisition of the Marathon interest in the Permian Basis gives us some 200 quality in fill development locations for oil in a core area. Moving on to 2010, as we look at 2010 we’re going to increase our activity level across North America.  The benefit of our very deep portfolio of acreage across the continent which is primarily HBP is that we can adjust our focus to any number of plays as the circumstances dictate. I will now outline our current 2010 North American operating plans. It should be noted in, I think this applies across our international regions as well, that while these are our current plans, we will continue to be a nimble value driven organization that will adjust our plans as necessary through the year to maximize value creation for our shareholders.  In 2010 we plan to run an average 26 drilling rigs in North America, nine in the central region, seven in the Gulf Coast region and five each in the Permian and Canada regions. We currently plan to drill 413 net wells in North America for this year, that will be up from 282 in 2009. Of this 2010 total of 381 will be development wells and 32 exploration wells. On the development side we expect to run 22 rigs, the top drivers of this activity will be in the following four programs. First our development in the Horn River Basin in Northeast British Columbia with our 50/50 partner in Canada. As mentioned earlier we drilled 42 gross wells in the Horn River Basin in 2009 while only completing four.  With our pad style developments we are significantly more efficient if we drill all of the wells on the pad before we start completion operations. The 2009 completed wells were the result of the last four wells on the EnCana operated 70-J pad. EnCana drilled an additional 11 wells on their 76-K pad and another five wells on their 63-K pad by the end of the year.  Meanwhile Apache drilled 16 wells on our 70-K pad and an addition seven wells on the 52-L pad during the year. We began completion operations on the Apache operated 70-K pad with 16 wells in January. We are now approximately one third of the way through our frac stimulation program with more than 90 fractures complete. We expect to get another two pads done with 25 to 28 gross wells completed before the end of the year. So in all we would expect to have 42 to 44 additional wells on production by the end of 2010. There is a little play in the timing as we continue to experiment with the number and sizes of fracs per well to optimize future development.  Our efficiency continues to improve through the program and we have completed as many as four fracs in a 24 hour period on several occasions. As our drilling activity continues we expect to leave 2010 with more than 30 wells drilled and ready for completion in 2011. We are targeting a 2010 exit rate of more than 100 million cubic feet of gas per day net from the Horn River but most of those volumes will be coming on in the second half of 2010. As Steven mentioned during 2010 we expect to conduct a feed study for an LNG plant operated by Apache on the west coast of Canada at Kitimat, British Columbia. This facility if we decide to proceed with it could allow export of significant gas volumes from the Horn River Basis as well as other Apache plays in North America.  Second, our continued development program in the Gulf of Mexico shelf, we currently plan to run an average of four rigs through the year on development plays and drill 29 development wells here, up from 17 last year. Our activity in the Gulf this year is off to an excellent start with positive results on all eight wells drilled so far.  For perspective the developments associated with those successes alone will generate a net present value of over $120 million with a 67% after-tax rate of return on some $95 million of expected capital invested.  Third, our horizontal Granite Wash development program is expect to involve an average of five rigs during 2010. We have 29 gross wells, 17 net, in our 2010 plans, up from seven net wells last year. With our success to date, we are already planning to increase activity to 25 net wells for 2010 and we’re targeting a year end net production rate of 75 million cubic feet of gas per day from the Granite Wash.  And then finally our oil focused Permian development drilling program will involve an average of five rigs for the year and 171 net wells, almost double the 87 net wells we drilled in 2009. The remainder of our development activity in North America will involve an average of eight rigs for the year and 126 net wells across 12 programs ranging from East Texas [inaudible] plays to oil targeted plays in Canada, Oklahoma, and Kansas.  Our activity levels in these 12 other programs will be somewhat reduced from the 133 net wells in 2009, these being primarily conventional plays as we concentrate this year on development of those top four programs I just outlined. To give you a sense of the materiality of the 2010 development program, we expect it to provide a net contribution of 52,000 barrels per day in 2011, the first full year of production, with 83% of that volume coming from the top four programs.  On the exploration front, we will be significantly increasing our North American exploration activity in 2010. We plan to run an average of seven drilling rigs on this activity during the year and drill 32 net wells, up from 12 in 2009.  We will pursue eight different exploration programs representing a balanced range of continuing trend exploration in the Gulf of Mexico to new plays involving horizontal drilling in a number of offshore locations across the continent. We are not in a position to talk about most of these for now due to commercial sensitivity.  One development we can note is in Eastern Canada where we have completed a transaction with Corridor Resources under which Apache will fund the testing of potentially large unconventional resources in New Brunswick, close to the East Coast population centers in Canada and the US. We will drill and operate at least two wells in that play during 2010. We have good reason to believe that the exploration programs we are advancing in 2010 will have the resource scale equivalent to or greater than the plays we are now moving into development in the Horn River and Granite Wash.  On an organizational front, as a final note in North America we have created a new regional unit for the Permian Basis. The Permian Basin has been part of our Tulsa based central region over the last number of years. We are one of the largest producers in the Permian Basis. The new regional organization will be based in Midland, Texas.  We put these two regions together in 2002 but due to our growth over the years, that combined capital program has increased tenfold today. We think separating them will continue the growth in both regions. You will see the performance of these two regions reported separately starting in the first quarter of 2010. And with that I’d like to turn it over to Rod Eichler who will discuss our international activity. 
Rod Eichler : Thank you John, Apache’s international regions reported excellent results in 2009 highlighted by outstanding exploration and development activity and by seeking out and entering into new markets to sell future production of natural gas in Australia and Argentina at more attractive prices.  Production in our international regions grew by 21% in 2009 to a yearly average 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day driven by drilling successes and significant increases in Egyptian oil and gas production, as well as significant increases in Australian gas production.  Our Egypt region had another outstanding year. Net production averaged 152,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 38% over 2008. For the year Apache drilled 164 wells in the western desert including 23 wildcats. Once again making Apache the most active and successful operator. Fourth quarter drilling successes in the AEB at Phiops and [inaudible] 2-X in the Faghur Basin along with successful completions in the [inaudible] concession in the Jade Field and at Falcon helped drive gross production to record high 316,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day at year end. Apache’s Australia region production in 2009 increased 40% to 40,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day driven by the restoration of our Varanus Island facility. Apache took a large step forward in 2009 towards securing new markets for its Australian natural gas by agreeing to produce our estimated 2.1 TCF of natural gas reserves at our [Julemar] discovery through the Wheatstone LNG facility operated by Chevron.  We expect to complete the feed study and make final investment decisions in 2011. First production is scheduled for 2015. North Sea production averaged 61,400 barrels of oil per day in 2009, an increase of 2.5% over 2008 levels due to increased production from several wells drilled in early 2009 and higher production efficiency for most of the year.  During the fourth quarter we experienced reduced production at [Forties] Field due to pipeline riser repairs on Bravo platform which have since been completed. Our North Sea region actually had its second consecutive year of production growth. This is remarkable achievement in a 35 year old oil field, the largest in the North Sea, which had been in decline for many years before Apache took over operations in 2003. We drilled 17 wells and added 9,200 barrels a day over the year. The Forties [Starling] 6-3 well completed in June has already recovered 1.3 million barrels of oil and the Forties Alpha 4-5 well completed in January is still flowing water free at nearly 5,000 barrels of oil per day and has reached cumulative production of 1.7 million barrels of oil. In Argentina we drilled 32 wells with a 97% success rate. Net production for 2009 averaged 45,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day which was 5% below 2008 due to a reduction in capital spending in 2009 and lower seasonal takes by customers in the fourth quarter. However there were two important events for Apache that occurred in Argentina in 2009. First was successfully extending the life of all of our concessions and [inaudible] from 2017 to 2027. Second we received approval for four gas plus projects which will allow Apache to sell significant quantities of natural gas at higher prices in the future. Looking at 2010, we are forecasting a very active development and exploration program across our international regions. We expect to run an average of 28 drilling rigs in our core areas over the year.  We plan to drill 299 gross or 249 net wells which is up from 248 gross or 213 net wells in 2009. Of these 299 gross wells in 2010, 223 or 188 net will be development and 76 gross wells or 61 net wells will be exploratory. In the development area I’d like to highlight four major programs driving our drilling activity in 2010. First we will continue the full field development water flood programs in Egypt at the [Hebba] and the [Sala] Ridge field and East NEAG which will involve six rigs and 111 wells of which 55 are producing wells. We presently produce about 70,000 barrels a day gross from our secondary recovery projects in Egypt.  Secondly we’ll continue our Cretaceous and [inaudible] oil and rich gas development projects with our greater [Khalda] area in Egypt employing six rigs, drill 33 wells. Thirdly, our Forties oil field development program in the North Sea will employ two platform rigs and a jack up to drill 15 new wells.  Among the new developments in our mall discovery from the fourth quarter of 2009 which we are progressing to achieve first production of 5,000 barrels of oil per day by mid year. Lastly our gas plus development programs in Argentina will average three rigs, drilling 21 wells in 2010. Gas plus developments will be our drilling focus in the [inaudible] basis as these will benefit from sales prices of $4.10 per million BTU on 10 million a day contracts for 2010 and $5.00 per million BTU on 50 million a day contracts beginning in 2011. Additionally we are presently progressing three new gas plus contracts for approval.  I should note that the first three of these four largest development programs all target oil. The remaining 43 development wells are spread over six different programs across our core areas and are also focused primarily on oil. We expect this development drilling program for the year to grow to contribute around 50,000 barrels of oil per day of new net production by its first full year of contribution in 2011. During 2010 we’ll continue to progress other material projects in our longer term growth pipeline. Projects that have resulted from exploration discoveries in prior years. The first of these will be production from our Van Gogh and Pyrenees projects in Australia which are expected to contribute 40,000 barrels a day of net new oil production.  As we reported earlier this week Van Gogh has already started production. These volumes are incremental to the contribution from our development drilling program that I just outlined. Ongoing projects in Australia include the Reindeer, [Haliard], [Masident], and [Julimar] gas developments and the [Coneston] oil development.  In Egypt expansion of our oil gathering and transportation facilities as a result of our 2009 Faghur Basis discoveries at Phiops and [West Kalabsha] will be complete by the fourth quarter. The capacity of these new facilities will allow for ramp up of production from the current gross 9,000 barrels of oil per day to 40,000 barrels per day of gross production.  Additionally construction of the fifth gas processing train in our Salam gas plant is expected to commence by year end. With this very active development and production infrastructure program we expect 2010 to be another year of robust production growth for Apache’s international regions.  And the many ongoing projects represent significant sources of new production that will come on stream between 2011 and 2015. In international exploration we expect to run an average of 10 rigs during 2010 and expect to drill 76 gross and 61 net wells, 39 of these wells will be in Egypt where we will benefit from a decade long consistent new field discovery rate that allows us to bring on production very quickly due to our wide operational reach across the western desert. In 2010 we are focusing our exploration drilling on the oil and rich gas condensate prospects of the AEB and [Jurassic] formations in our concessions covering four western desert areas; the Faghur Basin including the Phiops [inaudible] areas, the [inaudible] structure trend, the Abu Gharadig basis and the [inaudible] basin. Additionally we are setting up future exploration drilling programs with the planned acquisition of 3000 square kilometers of new 3D seismic and five surveys covering 10 of our concessions, a 70% increase from our 3D acquisitions over 2009. Our proprietary 3D coverage of the western desert now exceeds 30,000 square kilometers.  In Australia we expect to drill 19 exploration wells, focusing on our significant offshore acreage holdings in the [Kanarvin] basin of the northwest shelf. The program will be principally focused on new prospects in the [Julimar] field trend in support of our Wheatstone LNG project participation and the [inaudible] [Haliard], [Harriett] and [Masedon] areas in support of our domestic gas supply projects. Additionally we expect to acquire 1400 square kilometers of 3D seismic and five surveys including a benchmark 40 survey in the [Coneston] Van Gogh field areas. In Argentina where we did not drill any exploration wells last year as we focused on building was a very interesting portfolio of diverse plays across the country, our 10 well exploration drilling program this year will target impacted prospects or pre [Cujo], [Cujo], and Springhill reservoirs in each of the new [Concujo] and [Astrail] basins.  In the North Sea we will resume exploration drilling near the Forties field complex with three wells after two years of primary focus on development drilling. To summarize our international exploration program for 2010 we will conducting an impactive exploration drilling program across our core areas that will target an aggregate of nearly 290,000 million barrels of oil equivalent of list mean net reserves.  We will acquire 5500 square kilometer of proprietary 3D seismic in support of future exploration and development activities and we will progress key infrastructure projects in Egypt, Australia, and the North Sea to provide for continued production growth in 2010 and future years.  And with that I’d like to pass it over to Roger. 
Roger Plank : Thank you Rod and good afternoon everyone. What a year, a tale of two cycles, financial armageddon followed by a recovery that’s surprised virtually everyone in the spring. What started out as a downright scary year ended with $1.9 billion of adjusted earnings or $5.59 a share for the year.  Fourth quarter adjusted earnings more than doubled the $664 million or $1.96 per share from the fourth quarter of 2008. And they were the strongest earnings of the year. Who would have thought it. Cash from operations were just shy of $5 million for the year and over $1.4 billion for the quarter. Compared to our initial plan the cash flow was 36% or $1.3 billion higher enabling us to increase drilling capital by $350 million and acquire $300 million of properties while still living within cash flow.  Our 9% production growth despite 40% less capital speaks to the benefit of our long-term approach. Clearly this growth could not have been achieved if not for first production from a number of significant long-term development projects.  Exploration success continues to add to our pipeline of development projects providing growth visibility that can really move the needle once brought online. Despite higher production and substantially reduced capital Apache added 215 million barrels of oil equivalents through drilling and acquisitions outpacing production of 213 million barrels of oil equivalent at a cost of $3.5 billion.  These additions were added at $16 per barrel of oil equivalent and were quite economic as some 40% of our additions were oil. At $70 a barrel oil sells at 14 times the price of gas leaving plenty of profit margin. This growing disparity between the value of oil and gas underscores Apache’s advantageous product mix.  Oil and NGL comprised half of our production with 72% of our 2009 revenue. We talk a lot about our balanced production mix but I think its often lost just how valuable oil really is to us. Our 50/50 production mix generated last year $8.6 billion in revenue. To get the same revenue if we were all gas we would have had to produce 2.3 TCS or twice what we actually produced.  The point is our oil production is incredibly valuable to us. Earn in natural gas also held up quite well because its not tied to volatile North American spot prices. In fact while North American realizations declined by half in 2009 our international gas price dropped less than 20% coupled with 25% production drills, our international gas revenue actually climbed 5% to $770 million.  Prospects are excellent for our international gas revenue to continue to grow as once [trend] gas rises toward world prices. With international contributing 51% of our total productivity Apache is the leading independent international producer in our peer group and we think that gives us a competitive advantage both in terms of finding more oil in the future and benefiting from rising international gas prices.  Finally in 2009 against our number one priority to live within cash flow Apache ended the year with just over $2 billion of cash on the books versus just under $2 billion in 2008. I would note that this was accomplished without having to issue equity at or near the bottom of the market.  That having been said the real question is what’s next. Now that the world economy is no longer dangling so close to the precipice of financial ruin, we’re going to step it up a notch. We plan to increase the [inaudible] capital by about half to $6 or $6.5 billion which we figure roughly approximates 2010 cash flow assuming prices of around $70 a barrel and $5 per MCS. As usual Apache will reassess our capital budget on a quarterly basis and adapt accordingly. Capital spending including for GDP facilities and T&A is forecasted to be split evenly between North America and international with significant increases in 2010 are in drilling as activity ramps up to more typical levels and in facilities with our large projects progressing in Australia, Egypt, North Sea, and Canada. The largest increases will occur in the US after splitting our central region and in Canada and Australia. You can find capital spending details by country on our website under the supplemental financial data section that Tom mentioned.  Given our increased budget for 2010 we currently have hedged approximately 40% of our year end North American gas production, 225,000 MMBTu per day is hedged with swaps averaging around $5.80, and 84,000 MMBTu per day is hedged using [collars] with average floors and ceilings of around $5.50 and $7.00. We’ve also hedged 150,000 gigajoules per day of our Canadian gas production with swaps at an average of around $5.35 in Canadian dollars at [payco]. On the oil side we haven’t been quite as aggressive. We’ve hedged just over 10% of our worldwide liquid for an average of 35,000 barrels per day for 2010, approximately 80% represents collars with average floors and ceilings approximating $55 and $81 a barrel. The balance is swapped at an average price of just under $69 a barrel.  We’re also actively screening acquisition opportunities and while we are not in hot pursuit at the moment it is apparent that our industry’s acquisition pipeline is fine. In addition to our $2 billion of cash, $2.3 billion of undrawn credit lines, leave us a combined $4.3 billion of firepower. This an a low 24% debt to cap provides considerable flexibility to act on either incremental drilling or acquisitions should attractive opportunities materialize.  With respect to costs we currently forecast slightly higher cash costs including taxes other than income but I will tell you our goal is to keep them flat with 2009 average of around $11.25 per BOE. With a strong financial position, solid oil prices, international gas prices trending higher and projected production growth of 5% to 10%, the current outlook for 2010 is quite favorable.
Steven Farris : Thank you Roger, I’d like to close by summarizing what I think are the three main messages of all the information that all the gentlemen have shared today, the first is 2009 was a good year for Apache. We had strong growth in a challenging environment with restricted capital and well count.  We really owe this to the performance and hard work of our team and their focusing on generating growth and value. The second message Roger just mentioned is that we expect to have 5% to 10% net production growth in 2010 and I might add in addition our development drilling program will deliver 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the first full year of its contribution in 2011. And third we built a well balanced global portfolio of growth areas for the long-term. The diversity of our 2010 operating plans outlined by John and Rod I think reflect that. So 2010 is going to be a very busy year for Apache. And with the organization and opportunity set there’s much more in front of us in the years ahead.  So before we go back to work, we’d be ready to take your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Bob Morris – Citigroup
Bob Morris – Citigroup: I have a question looking at your findings about cost and reserve replacement by region, Canada was by far the best region in terms of both reserve replacement and finding costs even after revisions, and that’s been a challenging region for other companies out there. Was the strong extension and discoveries that you booked in Canada, the result of a lot of floods being booked at Horn River or what drove that. 
Steven Farris : I might open it up, Horn River is our big play. We had some flood drilling locations that we drilled this year and basically we have one year of drilling, a pad drilling program for 2010 started up. But we really didn’t change the way we looked at our business. If you looked at our overall portfolio our [pads] are up 3% year over year. 
Bob Morris – Citigroup: So most of the extensions in discoveries you booked in Canada were [pads] at Horn River. 
John Crum : Yes that would be correct. But the real point we’re making there is that we haven’t really got ahead of this year. We really just pudding up the next year’s drilling program. Basically an extra pad alongside the pads we’ve already drilled. 
Bob Morris – Citigroup: And the revisions that you recorded in Egypt, were those all associated with the PSC contracts essentially. 
Rod Eichler : Yes, that was all price. 
Bob Morris – Citigroup: I know you had a great year in Egypt with all the exploratory and drilling success, the oil price that you did those adjustments on or the PSC contract was based, looks like about $63 a barrel, yet you’re finding development costs in Egypt was over $31 a barrel, and I just wanted to get you comments on the economics of that because I would have expected perhaps a lower finding and development cost, that oil price given the success that you had in Egypt.
Steven Farris : I will tell you what happens, because of the oil price you get a real, when you say what we booked, what we booked is the same thing that’s happened to us on a revision side frankly because you have to run that through the PSC. If we had $40 a barrel your finding cost probably would have been a third of what they are today. And it really is a very economic place because what happens is is that you get all your costs back in four years.  So you’ve got to be real careful whether we show really good finding costs or we show really high finding costs in Egypt that if you run it on one price or you look at it on a gross oil basis, it would be much better off if you understand what I’m saying. 
Bob Morris – Citigroup: Yes because I was looking at $63 per barrel was the price you had to base your bookings in the PSC on and the finding cost is running about a little over 50% of that oil price which is the basis for your bookings which I would have expected it, the finding costs to be maybe a third of what oil price basis was. 
Steven Farris : But you see the problem is your reserves and I’m sure Tom can answer this, you run your reserves through the total PSC to come up with what your extensions are. Just like the base, so it effects not only your reserve revision but it also effects the amount of reserves you book. It’s a timing difference. 
Rod Eichler : The only thing I would add to that is that you have to take into account that you have a cost recovery mechanism of the PCS in that you have a large balance of costs are constantly growing forward and that’s a big difference on one quarter to the next on one year to the next depending on how much money is in that pool from your prior year spending. And additionally the cost recovery Steve mentioned was prior to capital expenses over 16 financial quarters, you’re operating expenses were recovered were [inaudible] over four financial quarters or one year.  So it’s a complex mechanism because of the PSC. Basically when prices are up we lose revenue interest on our share. When prices are down we benefit in the opposite direction. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs: I wanted to get a little bit more color on the Permian basin especially since you’re now going to be designating it as a new unit, can you talk about the materiality of your program for this year and whether that’s an area that you expect to grow solely organically or whether that’s in your outlook for additional, maybe larger acquisitions. 
John Crum : I think that’s one of those places we’d like to do both in. We’ve got a number of interesting exploration ideas that we will be trying over the next year but its certainly an area we’d like to grow by acquisition as well. Its been good to us. We’ve got a good operating group responsible for it and we think we can grow that region for years to come. 
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs: And what do you expect to be your contribution from this year’s program and then similar to how you were presenting the contribution to year end or 2011 barrels a day. 
John Crum :  I’d probably have to get back with you on, I didn’t break that out here but you can imagine the primary program out there that we outlined for you was in full development program so I would expect any activity we get out of exploration won’t be showing up really until 2011.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs: And then looking at your capital program which I think you mentioned was based on $70 oil and $5 gas, if oil prices do end up averaging $75, $80, $85, would you look to increase capital budget and where would be your priorities oil, gas regionally for incremental spending. 
Steven Farris : I think our mantra is we’d like to stay around our cash flow and if we see just like this year frankly, we spent more money that we started out. I think we started out at $3.5 billion and we ended up spending I think $4.1 billion or thereabouts. If we see higher oil prices and higher revenues, net cash flow we’ll spend more money.  And that probably will come in several regions, Australia is pretty well set just because of the rig activity and but we certainly could spend more money in North America and in the central region. We could spend more money in the Gulf of Mexico. Actually we could spend more money in each one of those regions and then we could also spend more money in Egypt. 
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs: When should we expect or what timing are you looking at for selling any off take for Wheatstone gas contracts. 
Steven Farris : 2015.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs: In terms of when you would actually sign a contract—
Steven Farris : That would likely take place prior to final investment decision before mid year 2011. We’ve got to be real careful were not [inaudible] that back, so we probably know some things that we’re just going to have to defer to the operator. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Allman - JPMorgan
Joe Allman - JPMorgan: Just a question on reserves again, in terms of your and again on revisions, on your total revision and I know its complicated somewhat by the Egypt production sharing contract but your total revisions, what was the percentage of prove developed revisions and the percentage of [pud] revisions.  
Steven Farris : Well we don’t have our Vice President, Executive Vice President of Corporate or Engineering here we’re going to have to get back to you on that. All of the revisions were priced and I would imagine a big chunk of them were proved developed. But I, that’s a guess. 
Joe Allman - JPMorgan: In terms of the reserves acquisitions, you made in 2009 you bought some reserves, I think it was mostly in the US, was it mostly prove developed or [puds]. 
Steven Farris : Well actually that’s the only one we really made of any size was Marathon and that’s probably 70% or 75% proved develop producing. 
Joe Allman - JPMorgan: And on New Brunswick, are there any results in New Brunswick to speak of either by you or any other operators. 
John Crum : Well the operator has come out with a little bit of information on a test they did last year, but we really feel like we need to get in there and they did a vertical test last year and we were pleased enough with the results there that it made us go ahead and take this opportunity. But we’re going to draw horizontal wells this year and actually test the concept. 
Joe Allman - JPMorgan: And then you made a comment about the acquisition environment and I missed what you said, what is the acquisition environment look like these days. 
Roger Plank : Well I basically said two things, we’re not in hot pursuit of anything in particular at the moment, we’re just hearing of more things and so its our sense that the pipeline of acquisitions is beginning to thaw now that the world isn’t coming to an end. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate – BofA Merrill Lynch
Doug Leggate – BofA Merrill Lynch: I have a couple of things I wanted to go through, jumping right to Egypt your production obviously is bumping up pretty close to your target that you set a few years back, can you talk a little bit about was the ramp up in exploration drilling with the Salam 5 plant, just generally in terms of the overall prospectivity of the western desert particularly on the oil side, what exactly do you see the production potential moving over the next few years. 
Rod Eichler : As you know the numbers we put out for 2010 we’re looking at a program drilling wildcat drilling program that’s kind of back to our “normal” levels which runs around 30 wells a year. So its about 30% increase over, or 50% increase what we had in 2009. We have a even though we completed our Salam gas rigs 3 and 4, last summer, we have continued drilling successes through 2009, we still again find ourselves in a situation with the need to add more processing capacity to the western desert by building this fifth Salam gas train which we intend to initiate construction by year end as I indicated.  We have a lot of gas behind pipe as well as oil and these are condensate rich gas zones that have yet to be produced so it’s a matter of when you want to get it out and if you could live with the current facilities and stretch it out over many many years but we have a lot of near-term opportunities to increase net present value of that gas by producing it sooner as opposed to later.  Of course the government of Egypt is very interested in adding more processing capacity to accommodate the additional production because of the almost insatiable gas demand in the country of Egypt which continues to grow about 11% or 12% annually. So we have a very robust inventory of prospects, drilling about 175 to 200 wells a year and the exploration prospects continue to spawn additional development drilling year by year.  There’s been kind of a consistent pattern for the last decade, we’ve been drilling now some 16 or 1700 wells in the country and are successful on exploration development is very consistent year on year. 
Doug Leggate – BofA Merrill Lynch: What I’m really kind of working out here is you’re going to drill 30 plus exploration wells this year what is the, if you could talk to the backlog of what have you actually got in Egypt in terms of longer term potential. There seems to be a lot more oil as you have talked about and I think has a lot of geological [inaudible] in the western side of the desert, so it looks like you’ve got a lot of oil prospectivity there and I guess if you could overlay on that, what is the horizontal potential in that region and also I guess you’re going to have to reset your target at some point because you’re getting pretty close. I’m really trying to get a feel for is that incremental production going to be oil and if so what are you really see as the potential of this area let’s say in another three to five year target. 
Rod Eichler : The first part of your question with regard to the oil prospectivity, what we’ve observed is our recent drilling programs moving westward toward Libyan border and the Faghur Basin area west of our main properties base, is that things appear to be more oily there. Perhaps because its cooler from a geological sense but clearly the wells we’re making there are oil wells. And they’re oil wells that are deeper than you’d normally see in that part of the desert.  Our backlog of our inventory we are looking continually evaluating, assessing prospects are developed off of our very large seismic inventory. In fact we’ve been reshooting some of the areas, our main producing area that we’ve shot a decade ago and the data quality now has been amazing in turning up even more and more ideas.  Whether its on exploration projects or production enhancement projects or work overs, we have the, every year we have this inventory of maybe like 300 production enhancement projects and then we do the jobs, the next year we still have 300 production enhancement projects to do. The work continues to spawn other ideas and other work whether its on the exploration side, the exploration drilling, or the development of production enhancement activity.  Now as far as horizontal applications, activities for horizontal exploration in Egypt are really not even touched. And we are beginning to investigate through horizontal drilling certain formations, certain reservoir sequences that we think could be applicable to such and but many times these things have been done for years in North America and they just now arriving on shore in Egypt. There are no known horizontal plays operating in the country but we’re looking to see what we can do in that area from what we know from North America activity.  We have four horizontal wells planned for 2010.
Doug Leggate – BofA Merrill Lynch: I guess I’m not going to get the answer on the three to five year production targets, the only other one I have, moving to North America, I hope I’m not touching on any sensitivities here but the Horn River is obviously one thing but you have been pretty active right next door in the [inaudible], I’m just kind of wondering if you can give us any update on your activities or your plans on what you’ve seen so far and how that has played into you decision perhaps to get involved in Kitimat. 
Steven Farris : We’re buying a lot of acreage in a lot of different places in the world and Canada happens to be one of them. So that’s pretty much what our position is going to be there. 
Doug Leggate – BofA Merrill Lynch: The likely timing of when you start to see gas plus in Argentina start to [inaudible] those realizations and I’ll leave it there. 
Rod Eichler : The first contract which was for the 10 million a day, that actually started last month in January. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Tameron - Wells Fargo
David Tameron - Wells Fargo: A couple of questions, let me start with you mentioned a five and 70 that you’d be generating, did you say you’re going to generate 6 to 6.5. 
Roger Plank : Roughly. 
David Tameron - Wells Fargo: If I’m looking at forward guidance if I put, if I just look at margins, to generate $6 million at five and 70, [inaudible] is flat, are there any other changes as far as any other components that are moving significantly because it seems like that implies a higher margin for next year. 
Roger Plank : That flat that I mentioned excludes taxes other than income and so when oil goes up we get hit in the North Sea with [inaudible] CRT so that’s probably works a little bit against what you’re saying but in general you’re probably on track. 
David Tameron - Wells Fargo: It seems like a cost structure coming down a little more next year. You’re excluding the impact of taxes is that accurate.
Roger Plank : Our cash cost per unit probably are going to be, we’ll, as I indicated we’re going to target having it flat excluding the CRT and other taxes other than income. So wouldn’t have more production, we’d probably see a little higher costs but when you spread it out over more production DOE will be up, if we hit our target it will be flat. 
David Tameron - Wells Fargo: You talked about the Permian basin have you started doing any horizontal work down there yet or anything on that front as far as activity to apply that technology down at the Permian. 
John Crum : Yes we have as Rod indicated on his work in Egypt, we’ve also doing the same thing in the Permian basin picking out targets and doing some of that drilling. We’ve actually have a horizontal well being completed as we speak in our [inaudible] Lake unit so, that will be a fairly active play for us down in the Permian this year because we really want to see what kind of potential we have in the large acreage base we have down there. 
David Tameron - Wells Fargo: And that’s just going to be an ongoing program throughout the year, we may hear something later in the year. 
John Crum : Absolutely and I hope you hear a lot about it later in the year. 
David Tameron - Wells Fargo: In Egypt, as you move west is there any I know you announced an agreement today but as I think about historical Apache to the kind of the western desert, and some of the oil exploration is there any difference in the cost recovery mechanisms or anything you can share. 
Rod Eichler : The cost recovery mechanisms of course can vary from concession to concession because each is an individual law. However for Apache’s concession, the 22 concessions we have the variance between the concessions is very, very small.
Roger Plank : With the exception of one and that’s [Karoon] and the production is—
Rod Eichler : We have no shared excess cost recovery in [Karoon] and at north [Eldiau] are very tiny concession. All the rest of them have shared excess and very favorable physical terms in terms of profit splits. Renewal terms, the two that we just renewed, very importantly the called offset that was a seven year extension, that we had approved by the government. East [Baharia] it was a three year extension. Called offset is very important to us because it’s the home of one of our bread and butter operations historically and this will be unlike a typical exploration concession that you’d be granted in the country, there are still relinquishment associated with the seven year, the block seven year term to do all that work.
Roger Plank : And the splits don’t generally change.
Rod Eichler : The splits stay the same, they’re the same base physical terms as we had from the original concessions. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Dell – Bernstein 
Ben Dell – Bernstein : I just had one quick question, you’re obviously ramping up your capital program a lot and I was really wondering how much is your rig cost and service costs have you got locked in going into 2010 particularly I guess in the US on shore business given the horizontal rigs right now. 
Steven Farris : I think there’s very little right now, perhaps the only place that may not be that way is in the Gulf of Mexico where we usually take a longer view of our jack up rigs, but certainly the land rigs in the US we still believe they’re going to be flat because the vast majority of things that are drilled in the United States today are still gas. And I think gas was down [$0.03] today so I doubt if you see a real surge in rig rates here at $5.12 gas. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lively – Tudor Pickering
Brian Lively – Tudor Pickering: Just a question on the Granite Wash, given your vertical well control can you give some color on variability in reservoir properties across the play both laterally and then within the major productive horizons. 
John Crum : I don't know how much color I can give you, but you’ve called on a key point there, clearly across the entire Granite Wash play there’s a variety of numbers of sands available for development and different yields we would expect out of those.  So we obviously have a pretty good feel for what we’d see in some of the areas that we’ve drilling for years out there and so we’re concentrating on those areas that first of all would have the highest liquid yields, with that said we’re going to be a lot of work around really trying to set our entire position out there over this year. So you should expect us to be very active in that Granite Wash play across our entire acreage position this year. 
Brian Lively – Tudor Pickering: We talked, we’ve heard about the [Marmeton] and the [Etoka], but what are the other intervals that you will be pursuing in the coming year. 
John Crum : We’ll have [Marmeton], [Etoka], we’ll have, we talk a lot about the Granite Wash A, B, we talked about the Caldwell. We have a variety of them that we’ll be testing this year and really the interesting piece for going forward on this play in my opinion is getting to the point where we could actually get where we could do multi laterals and develop more than one of these intervals in the same well bore.  But we’ll be trying that concept out too. But I think that’s where the future is.  
Brian Lively – Tudor Pickering: You are going to try multi lateral in 2010.
John Crum : Absolutely. 
Brian Lively – Tudor Pickering: Switching over to the Horn River have you tested both the [Muskwa] and the [Clua] intervals. 
John Crum : Yes we have. On our present, we have one well completed in, well we actually have two wells completed at [Clua], the first one is a vertical well but we have one horizontal well completed in [Clua] from 2008, however we were somewhat compromised on the frac jobs we got on it and we only got four frac jobs out of it. It is about half as thick as the [Muskwa] so we won’t spend as much time on that because if you’ve got certain number of rigs running you’re going to go after your bigger targets first.  But I will tell you we’ve got two wells on the 16 well 70-K pad that we are completing right now, two [Clua] wells are in that mix and so we’ll know a lot more about the [Clua] by the end of this year. 
Brian Lively – Tudor Pickering: And since you’ve had some run time on I know its just a select few wells but has your spacing assumptions changed any now that you have some production. 
John Crum : That’s what I was talking about experimenting some more out there, we’ve got a lot of activity going on, the pad we’re drilling presently are 52-L pad, we’ve actually spaced, we’ve brought the spacing between individual laterals out to two different widths. We’ve added about 80 meters to one side of the pad and about 50 meters to the other side of the pad.  And that’s, the real key out here is we’ve got literally 200 pads worth of potential at 15, 16 wells per pad and so far we’ve got four of these developed so we’re trying to get the right answers on the big picture. We’ve got a lot of activity to go. In a perfect world you would get your spacing between horizontal well bores out further and put more fracs in the individual laterals and that’s what you’ll see us doing a lot more of this year, up to 20 fracs on an individual lateral. 
Brian Lively – Tudor Pickering: And how long of a lateral would that be for 20 fracs. 
John Crum : Well we’re out to 2200 meters. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of [Marvin Hayes – CVP]
[Marvin Hayes – CVP]: I was wondering obviously given cash on the balance sheet, liquidity, etc., we’ve been talking about expansion of CapEx and property acquisitions and things of that nature, with that said I’m wondering are there existing properties or plays at this point that from let’s say reach critical mass or would demonstrate superior economics compared to some of your other opportunities that may be potential candidates for divestitures as you optimize your portfolio.
Steven Farris : We’re not a very good seller. Its hard enough to [find].
[Marvin Hayes – CVP]: Clearly they’re cheering I guess so I guess we should simply watch where the capital dollars go in order to assess that.  
Steven Farris : We certainly do, I’m always jaded by, we bought some things over from Exxon over a number of years and its always been a cat fight. The gentleman that used to be pretty influential in Exxon used to tell me, because we were arguing about 40 acres, and he said Steven, 40 acres was a lot its hard to come by so we have a little bit, not that we’re anywhere near the quality or size of Exxon but we have a little bit of the same and the reason is frankly if you look across our portfolio and I’ll give you for example, let’s take [Nebis]. It was a little shallow gas play and all of a sudden we drilled CPM wells on it and I think we probably are still producing 80 or 90 million a day out of the [inaudible] methane at [Sabah] that we really didn’t see.  We’re talking an awful lot about Granite Wash, we probably got Granite Wash 500 wells. We drilled our first Granite Wash probably in the 50’s and we’re getting ready to come through there with a horizontal play that we have HBP of 200,000 acres.  Or if you look at some of the things we’re doing in west Texas, horizontal wells and the water floods and all of a sudden you are able to increase production. Only acreage in real well known hydrocarbon areas really gives you an advantage especially if you’re large which is why you see us in large positions in most places that we’re in.
John Crum : Even if you look at Horn River, that grew up under a marginal play for us. We added a lot of acreage but it really started with ratty old acreage that we hadn’t sold. There’s a lot of optionality in some of that old stuff that doesn’t look very attractive. It’s a hard thing to source through because it shows up in costs and you’ll wonder why you’re holding onto it and then every now and then you find something underneath it that makes it more than worthwhile. 
[Marvin Hayes – CVP]: In the past when we’ve looked at potential basis differentials and realization in North American natural gas the Rockies, in past historically was particularly good standing, obviously with pipeline takeaways and access to the eastern markets much of that has been alleviated. But as the [Marcelus] comes on to become a very significant material producer in the next three to four years, can you assess your North American natural gas portfolio, are there places where you’re concerned about basis differential or simply crowding out of perhaps supply that’s closer to market than you may be and how you might be thinking about potentially directing those concerns going forward.
Steven Farris : I think honestly it’s a very good macro question, because as these shale plays have come through there’s absolutely no doubt that you’re going to change the dynamics in North American gas. Now what the end results of that is, I’m not real sure. Because it has a lot to do with pipelines etc. but there’s no doubt that [Marcelus] is in a favorable position. We’ve seen that frankly a little bit in the Gulf Coast with the Haynesville gas going across. Its fascinating to me that depending on the price you get basis differentials in Canada from $1.30 and its probably the lowest its been right now than it has been in a long time. And you ask yourself why. I’m not sure but I think it is generally and we don’t have an answer for it frankly right at the moment. But trust me we are very cognizant of that.  But I don't know what the drivers are going to be other than closeness to the market. 
Roger Plank : And we’ve got to keep our costs down and that’s one advantage that Horn River play has ultimately it sets up very well geologically and that ought to be able to enable us to get our costs down and therefore suffer a bit more of the transportation and distance differential. 
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Ken Carroll – Johnson Rice
Ken Carroll – Johnson Rice: Quick question back to the investor conference you talked quite a bit about your eagle your position, [inaudible] how you attempted some oil, is there any further testing in that. I think you mentioned looking to the gas window a bit. 
Steven Farris : We are going to be doing a little more testing this year. I will say and it’s a different area technically. Having said that so was the [Barnett] shale at one time, back when it was making 300 MCFs a day and frankly Devon had the foresight to go out there and buy it. But there will be a time and I really believe this and I don't know when that is from a technology standpoint the [Eagleford] the important thing about it is its got some of the highest per acre coal in place of any shale play in the United States. So and the important thing about that is we’ve got about 450,000 that sell by production. So we can like most of our acreage one of the reasons you don’t see us as trend setters a lot in North America is most of our acreage is held by production so we can let people do an awful lot of experimenting before we turn the technology. Same reason we’re starting to get in west Texas, there’s been a lot of horizontal wells. If you look on the map you can see that.  But we have a tremendous acreage position out there that now allows us to go out there and really start exploiting our base property. 
Ken Carroll – Johnson Rice: But the early wells you have talked about have all been in the oil window, I thought you had mentioned at some point trying to go in the gas window, has that been done or is that part of the testing this year. 
Steven Farris : I’d hate to say it this way but I think we’ve got lots of gas. 
Operator: There are no additional questions at this time; I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing comments. 
Tom Chambers : Thanks for joining us today and if anybody has any further questions, I’ll be in my office after the call.

===== 2009 Q3  (2009-10-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Apache Corporation third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. This call is being recorded. Today's presentation will be hosted by Mr. Tom Chambers, Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor Relations. Mr. Chambers, please go ahead.
Tom Chambers: Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us for Apache Corporation's third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. This morning you'll see we reported third quarter net income of $441 million or $1.30 per diluted share and cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion. Adjusted earnings which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of the results totaled $534 million or $1.58 per diluted share. On today's call we'll have four speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. Steve Farris will kick off the session. He's our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Rod Eichler our Co-Chief Operating Officer and President, International; then John Crum our Co-Chief Operating Officer and President of North America; and Roger Plank our President. Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions and no assurance can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is included on our website. Any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or costs incurred, will be identified as such with the reconciliation located on our website. In addition, we have posted some supplemental financial information for the quarter on our website as well. All this information can be accessed at www.apachecorp.com/financialdata. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Farris: Apache delivered solid production growth during the third quarter. Production was up 19% against the same period last year and up 8% on a year-to-year basis compared to last year. In a moment, Rod and John and Roger will walk through our progress during the quarter. First I'd like to highlight three specific recent developments that we've had. The first, as you may have read, we're going to pursue the development of a liquefied natural gas export hub in Western Australia which is in cooperation with Chevron and Kuwait's KUFPEC. The project is called Wheatstone and will give Apache a steady cash flow base for 15 years. This cash flow base will be based on production net to Apache of 190 million cubic feet gas per day and 5,100 barrels of condensate per day for 15 years without decline. We expect the natural gas to be marketed on a long-term contract basis at Asian LNG prices. These are linked to oil prices and represent a significant premium to North American gas prices. In addition to project's realizations, we'll have the benefit of contractual stability for the duration of the project which enhances our portfolio balance which is in contrast to the boom and crash volatility of North American natural gas prices. Apache's mission is to create long-term superior value for our shareholders and this project is an outstanding example of it. Looking beyond the immediate project, we have a very large prospective acreage position in Western Australia and the Wheatstone infrastructure goes right through the middle of much of it and it's expected to provide the means to monetize our ongoing exploration discoveries at premium and stable oil length prices. The second item is the recent developments that we've had in Argentina where we've signed a gas contract for $5 and aim for our gas. We have an outstanding resource base in Argentina and we built at a very low cost compared to others because we got in when others gave up. And it's been our belief all along that the economic fundamentals ultimately prevail, and regulated hydrocarbon prices would have to adjust to meet energy demands as they did in this country in the 1970s. The agreement is a great example of how fundamentals ultimately do prevail, creating value for our shareholders. The third item I'd like to highlight is our Granite Wash play in central region of the US. I think you might have read this morning, we reported the results of our first well there which started production at 17 million cubic feet of gas a day and 800 barrels of liquids per day. I might say with these kind of liquids, you can make very good economics at very low gas prices. We control over 200,000 acres across the play and we currently plan to drill 20 wells in 2010. We built one of the leading acreage positions in North America which has not been over the last few years but really over the last decades. Drilling and completion innovations continue to unlock new opportunities and the Granite Wash is a great example of that. Also importantly, substantially all of Apache's North American acreage is primarily held by production which allows us to pick development timing to maximize the value of our shareholders. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Rod and John and Roger and then we'll go into Q&A.
Rod Eichler: Thank you, Steve. I will provide a quick overview of the main developments in our international regions. During the third quarter, production from Apache's international operations was 316,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 4.6% increase over second quarter. The production increase can be attributed to drilling successes in the North Sea as well as a full quarter of restored production from Australia's Marinas Island. In Egypt, net production was 155,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 1.6% decrease from second quarter. The net decrease was due to higher oil prices resulting in lower cost recovery barrels under the PUC, combined with lower cost recovery. By contrast, gross BOE per day for the quarter increased by 16,700 barrels per day or 6% from 273,800 to 290,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. During the quarter, Egypt region achieved new daily gross production records per gross oil and condensate at 174,600 barrels of oil per day and gross gas at 823 million cubic feet gas per day. On the exploration side, we completed drilling and/or testing operations on six new wildcat resulting in two new field discoveries during the third quarter. Four wildcat wells are presently drilling. Apache has a 100% contract of working interest in all but one of these wells. Some brief highlights of the two new discoveries and significant appraisal and development wells in the greater call to concession area are as follows. The Chelsea-1X wells had (inaudible) call the offset concession tested $19 million a day of gas and 650 barrels of condensate from 31 feet of upper Safa sand and 1,800 barrels of oil per day from 38 feet of AEB sand. A development lease is pending approval by the government and production is expected to commence by year-end. The Prince 1-X wildcat in Las Clavellinas session logged 66 feet of upper Safa pay. The first zone of three to be completed, taxed at a rate of 20 million a day and 1,100 and 106 per day. Apache had a 64% working interest in this concession. In the Phiops area of the Faghur Basin, perhaps it continues to have exceptional developmental results in Cretaceous AEB formation which has been an important driver of production growth. This quarter, our success continued with one re-completion of an existing well and two new appraisal wells. The field discovery well, the Phiops-1X was recompleted from the Safa to AEB at a rate of 4,600 barrels of oil per day. Also during the quarter, Phiops-2X encountered 143 feet of AEB oil paid and tested up to 7,200 barrels of oil per day. The Phiops-6X logged 157 feet of the same AEB oil pay as awaiting completion. This wells extends a Phiops accumulation Northwest on to our (inaudible) session. Perhaps at the Phiops field Production at the Phiops field is presently facilities constrained at 6,500 barrels a day. Expansion to 8,000 barrels a day is planned by year end and expansion to 20,000 barrels a day is targeted by third quarter 2010. On the development side, gross call to gas production which averaged 668 million cubic feet of gas per day during June, averaged 702 million cubic feet of gas per day during the third quarter and 750 million a day through September. As a result of full completion of the Salon three and four gas plants. Two shutdowns are scheduled in the fourth quarter at shales of biogas plant that was result of the deferrals about one Bcf of call to production. Turning to Australia, net production was 48,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day a 30% increase over second quarter. Gas oil production increased by 40% and 4% respectively. This increase is primarily due to having the full quarter's production following completion of Varanus Island repair project in the second quarter. In our Van Gogh oil project which Apache operates with a 52.5% working interest, final inspection repair works were on track to deliver FPSO to the field before the end of the year. All development drilling and subsea installation is completed with post production expected by year-end. Production is anticipated to ramp up to a peak of 20,000 barrels a day in 2010. The nearby BHP built and operated Pyrenees FPSO developer project, in which Apache had a 28.6% working interest, is also underway with development drilling and subsea installation progressing as planned. We expect first production in late first quarter of 2010. Production is also anticipated to ramp up to a peak of 20,000 barrels a day in 2010. We broke ground at our Devil Creek gas plant in September. Earthworks have commenced at the site no major onshore and offshore construction contracts have been awarded. We anticipate first gas from our Reindeer field in third quarter of 2011. Apache operates this project with a 55% working interest. We also entered feed for the BHP operated Macedon domestic gas developer project during this quarter, with a final investment decision expected in June of 2010. Apache has a 28.6% working interest in this project. During the quarter, drilling activity has been focused on the Coniston appraisal project with five wells having been drilled to date. Apache operates this project with a 45.7% working interest. Two wells in this program the Novara 3-H and Coniston 2-H. have been production tested at rates of 5,500 barrels per day and 11,200 barrels a day respectively. Additional wells will be required to fully delineate the pool in the fourth quarter. The Coniston accumulation is likely to be developed as a tie back to the Van Gogh FPSO. Last week, as Steve mentioned, Apache 284 and Foreign exploration company, announced our election of joined Chevron developed the Wheatstone Liquefied Natural Gas hub in Western Australia. Apache includes Exxon in an exclusive agreement to supply gas from our Julimar and Brunello discoveries and become foundation equity partners in Chevron's operating Wheatstone project facilities. This project unlocks 2.1 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves at two of Apache's largest discoveries and generates steady net sales of about 190 million per day and 5100 barrels of equivalent say today it's a 15 years of prices spent at oil prices. Apache has a net 16.25% interest in Wheatstone Phase I development. As a foundation partner Apache will also have the opportunity to participate in future expansion of the project providing additional options for gas commercialization. The final investment decision on the first phase of the project is slated for 2011 after the feed is completed. Turning to North Sea, net production averaged 67,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day an increase of 12.5% from second quarter, due to strong drilling results and increased field product efficiency. Production for the third quarter ranked as a second best quarter ever for the North Sea region since Apache became operator of the project in 2003. Production efficiency for 40s field averaged 94% for the quarter exceeding downtime excluding downtime for annual emergency shut down valve testing on the main export line from the 40s Charlie platform as well as a temporary repairs to a section of 35 years old 20 inch pipe near the base of the Bravo riser and Charlie platform. Including these two downtime events, production efficiency still averaged 90%. Production for the fourth quarter will be impacted by a shut down of Bravo platform. The platform which approves is approximately 11,500 barrels of oil per day has off-line throughout October but is expected to resume full production by 6 of November. The Bravo export piping which I mentioned previously that underwent temporary repair in August is undergoing permanent replacement of 80-meter section of the pipe which will complete the online replacement of Bravo that would be in 2008. On the drilling side, we drilled and completed five successful oil development wells during the second quarter. These wells contributed 3,600 barrels of oil per day for the quarter and 5,200 barrels a day in September. I've noticed the 42 Spraberry 33 C42 wells which is a 109 meters of field play and would go on production in September at 3,300 barrels a day. An indicated new oil pool discovery was made last week with the pilot hole drilled from the 40s (inaudible) well which intersected 15 meters of net pay in (Inaudible) and sands about 150 meters above the main Forties reservoir. This reservoir is equivalent to the driven sands which occur in the Echo platform area. Preliminary estimates on 5 to 6 million barrels of oils in place of which 2 million barrels of oil maybe recoverable. This discovery will likely qualify for a small field development application yielding up to 75 million pounds sterling and supplemental corporation tax break incentive as well as not being exposed to the PR2. Finally in Argentina, nets production was 44,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day down 4.7% from second quarter. The reasonable drilling program concentrated the Neuquén basin and things to be successful. During the quarter, a total of seven wells were drilled and completed adding gross product of 570 barrels of oil per day and 26 billion cubic feet of gas per day. The development program in the Ranquil Co field dominated the third quarter activity with three new wells drilled to four completions for a total production net of 360 barrels per day and 20 million cubic feet of gas per day. Most of the border Ranquil Co 1038 which generated 312 feet of pay at the average depth of 8,000 feet and was completed in three zones in the Pre-Cuyo formation initial production rate of 166 barrels per day and 8 million per day gas and the Ranquil Co 1039 which had 269 feet of pay and is completed in two zones in the same formation initial production rate of 60 barrels per day and 5 million a day gas. In addition the (inaudible) [X-20 2001] located in the Baja (inaudible) block tested two zones at the Khalda formation at an average depth of 3,000 feet at a rate of 4 million a day. This successful extend to the well has set up three or four additional locations in the field in late 2009 and 2010. In September, Apache received approval for two gas plus projects in the Neuquén and Rio Negro provinces in the nuke invasion sell to 50 million per day of gas to a power plant for $5 per million BTU. These two projects were the first projects to be approved by the government of Argentina to encourage development of tight and unconventional gas reservoirs to displace imported gas. In the next three years Apache will drill 12 wells in the AC field in the Neuquén province and 36 wells in the EFO field in Rio Negro province to support this project. Without the higher gas prices, these development drilling projects would not be feasible. Apache Argentina has since submitted five additional projects for gas plus approval. Today I'd like to turn the presentation over to John Crum who will discuss activities in our North American operations.
John Crum: Thank you, Rod. In our central region we produced 88,400 barrels equivalent for the quarter, up slightly from the second quarter. We had very little drilling and work over activity during the first two quarters as we waited for cost to reflect the 2009 product prices. In the meantime, we concentrate on building and upgrading our inventory. During the third quarter we began to measure drilling and work over recompletion program with emphasis on oil prospects and gain change or gas opportunities. We have now ramped up activity to a present level of eight drilling and 34 work over recompletion rigs running in the region. Results from the drilling and work over programs offset the regions natural decline. We expect fourth quarter to be up even more due to some notable new wells and a full quarter of activity. Overall, lifting costs were up 3.9% to 796 per BOE due almost exclusively to the additional work over activity. Base lifting costs were actually down as our cost reduction efforts continued to show. The region performed a 100 work over and recompletion projects during the quarter adding more than 1800 barrels equivalent to production volumes. On the drilling side, with emphasis on oil production, 70% of the central regions third quarter wells were drilled in the oil rich Permian Basin at shallow depths. On the Texas side of the basin, we drilled six [Delaware] wells in our TXL north and south units. The wells averaged just over 100 barrels of oil per day each and will result in a 20 well infill program planned for the first quarter of 2010. Apache has been particularly active in the New Mexico side of the basin maintaining three drilling rigs and five work over rigs during the quarter. In the last quarter, we drilled 27 new wells that came in producing an average of nearly 100 barrels of oil per day. We have an outstanding drilling inventory ranging in depth from 4,000 to 8,000 feet that we now expect to provide around 100 new wells per year in 2010 and 11 in New Mexico alone. In the Anadarko Basin, Apache completed the Tyler 2-55. This was the second well in a four well drilled to earn farm-in from BP. The well found 125 feet of pay in the Atoka wash at 17,000 feet and has been on for a month now averaging 5 million cubic feet of gas per day. Additional tests are scheduled in each of the two remaining BP sections for 2010 followed by an infill development program. As Steve mentioned this morning we released results on Apache's first operated horizontal Granite Wash well. The results were great. The Hostetter #1-23H in Washita County, Oklahoma has been producing the sales for the past four weeks and they are still flowing at 17 million cubic feet of gas a day with some 800 barrels of liquids. We have just completed drilling our second operated horizontal Granite Wash well on our Stiles Ranch acreage in the Texas Panhandle almost 50 miles west of the Hostetter well. Logs indicate more than 4,000 feet of hydrocarbon saturated sand. We will begin completion operations next week. The Granite Wash has long been a core stacked play for our central region where we drilled hundreds of vertical wells over the past decade. As a result we now control over 200,000 gross held by production acres in the play. Horizontal multi-frac technology has vastly improved the potential recoveries. The high associated liquid shield should make this play competitive with any other resources plays. We now have two horizontal rigs running in the Granite Wash fairway and the lot of 30, November. We would expect to run four horizontal rigs through 2010 resulting in at least 20 new wells. In our Gulf Coast Region, we produced an average of 123,300 barrels equivalent per day during the third quarter. That's up 5.6% from the second quarter. While the region maintained a modest level of rig activity for the quarter, three significant new wells added 2,100 barrels equivalent per day while continued hurricane recoveries and a full quarter of our Geauxpher field production more than offset the regions natural decline. Overall, lifting costs were up 4.6% to $1,282 per barrel, driven by increased work over expense and higher than planned hurricane recovery repairs. The significant new wells for the quarter included a re-completion of the 100%-owned South Timbalier at $308 which was brought on at 440 barrels per day. Re-development work continues at Ewing Bank 826 as we brought on the A11 sidetrack producing 1,200 barrels a day with Apache holding 100%. After settling the new platform and a new fault block discovery at (inaudible) Island 8376, the C-1 well is now producing 1,015 barrels per day. We own 48% working interest and plan three additional wells for 2010. Hurricane restoration efforts continue and we believe there is an additional 7,000 net BOEs to be added as the repairs are completed. We expect to get most of that volume by year end, but now have little control of the timing since remaining work is third party pipeline work. Knock on wood, but we have had no hurricane evacuation this year and we don't expect any for the remainder of the year as the weather cools. Our new two wells, deepwater Geauxpher field at Garden Banks 462 which came on production in the middle of the second quarter continues to produce strongly and average 98 million cubic feet of gas on a gross basis some 39 million feet net for the quarter. We expect to be more active late this year and into the next, as the region is built of robust inventory and solid drilling prospects. As such, we've contracted three jack-ups and two platform rigs for anticipated 2010 program. In Canada, the region produced 78,700 barrels equivalent per day, down 1.9% from the second quarter. The drop in production was primarily due to natural declines without supporting production from new well activity and from turnarounds at our Zama complex in Northern Alberta. The third quarter in Canada is usually difficult to show gains as we typically have very low activities levels in the second quarter due to the lack of access as we go through the winter break-up. Somewhat offsetting these declines however were the results from new wells coming on production at our Two Island Lake area in the Horn River basin which will be described later. We drilled 17 wells during the third quarter and expect to drill an additional 19 before the end of the year. The region listing cost per BOE were up 14% to 986 for the second quarter with almost half of that increase associated with exchange rate increases. The remainder is due to one-off costs associated with planned turnaround activity at Zama, Virginia hills and Snipe Lake. The region remains well under budgeted total dollar listing cost for the year due to their cost cutting efforts. While costs have responded to the lower product prices and the Alberta Government has attempted to respond to the downturn with some royalty adjustments, conventional gas well drilling in Alberta remains challenging with a significant portion of the cost savings being wiped out with higher exchange rates. We did drill a modest 11 well Nevis coal bed methane program on high-graded prospects that generated post drill economics showing an 18% after tax rate of return. The remainder of the third quarter conventional program focused on oil targets. We drilled 12 wells off recent 3-D seismic in our core shallow cretaceous (inaudible). Post drill economic show the program generated 32% after tax rate of return. We are especially pleased with two (inaudible) wells that combine for a total of 270 barrels of oil a day and two rigs channel wells that came in for a combined 166 barrels of oil per day. The region is preparing for a winter program to start late in the fourth quarter again focused on oil. Three wells are planned for Zama, four at Midale, six at House Mountain fields. Positive results from the winter program will lead to additional 2010 wells. At Horn River, two more wells at our 50% owned EnCana operated 70-J pad came on production at more than 10 million cubic feet of gas per day each. The four wells from the 2009 program continue to produce at more than 24 million feet per day after more than three months of production. The results support our new estimate of expected ultimate recoveries of over 12 Bcf per well for our 14 frac well. The Six (inaudible) wells from our 2008 program which utilized six to ten fracs per well, continued to meet expectations as well producing another 11 million cubic feet of gas per day after more than a year of production. We presently have the Apache-operated 16 well 70-K. pad and the EnCana 11 well 76-K pad fully drilled, and are waiting on completion operations. Completion operations in the 70-K pad Apache operated, will begin in December with fracking operations commencing in early January. First, production from that pad is expected in April but we'll ramp up quickly as we expect to frac all of the wells before bringing the pad on production. EnCana will immediately follow with the fracking of the 11 wells on the 76-K. We should have all 27 new wells on production near mid year 2010. Meanwhile, Apache has moved to the 52-L pad where we'll drill an additional 11 wells, experimenting with longer laterals with up to 20 fracs and wider spacing to optimize future development plans. Those wells are expected to be drilled by mid year and will be completed in the second half of 2010. EnCana has moved their rig to the 63-K pad where they will drill 14 (inaudible) wells by the end of the second quarter again followed by completion operations in the seconds half of 2010. As mentioned last quarter in support of the Horn River development, we have hedged a net 50 to 100 million cubic feet a day over the next three years at $6 to $7 per Mcf. We continue to find ways to reduce costs and improve rates and the recoveries which we are expected to make this a very competitive play for the long-term. And now I'll turn over the call to Roger Plank.
Roger Plank: I've got a potential laryngitis. So, I'll do my best to croak my way through these remarks before turning it back to Steve. Apache's strong third quarter results were driven by higher oil prices and record production of both oil and gas. Despite severe capital reductions this year, we grew daily production 3% sequentially to 607,000 barrels equivalent, piercing the 600 mark for the first time in our 50 plus years. Our balanced production mix also served us well with equivalent realization climbing 7% sequentially with 12% higher oil prices offsetting a 1% decline in our gas price. Earnings adjusted for the impact of foreign currency on deferred tax, of $534 million or $1.58 per share reached a high for the year during the quarter. Record production on higher realizations drove earnings 12% higher than the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion also reached a high for the year. Substantial free cash flow enabled cash balances to rise by over $0.5 billion to nearly $1.4 billion at the close of the quarter. As a result of stronger than planned cash flow and declining drilling costs, we've loosened up our purse strings on our capital budget to around $4.1 billion from an initial budget of just north of $3.5 billion. Turning to operating costs, our cash operating costs on a unit basis increased just under 10% sequentially, primarily on seven stacks and PRT with higher oil prices. Excluding these other taxes, our controllable cash operating costs were up only 1.5%. With production up and prices presently above third quarter averages, we anticipate a strong finish to a topsy-turvy year. Our long-term outlook for production growth remains strong with production plateauing at third quarter levels, until we get beyond the shut-ins in Egypt and the North Sea which we haven't mentioned. Production growth should get off to a fast start again next year as we bring (inaudible) online at our Van Gogh and Pyrenees developments and production rams up at (inaudible) in the first half of the year. Also for 2010, I'd note that we have beefed up our hedging position, particularly on the gas side in the face of burgeoning North American gas supplies. We hedged an average of 410,000 MMBTu per day of our projected 2010 North American production. Approximately 90% of the hedged volume was swapped at an average price of $5.60. The balance was hedged using collars with average floor and ceiling prices of $5.65, and $7.55 per MMBTu. For reference, hedge prices of $5.60 in 2010 compared very favorably to our average year-to-date realization in North America of $4.10. On oil side, we now hedged an average of 35,000 barrels per day for 2010 mostly utilizing collars with average floor and ceiling prices of $65.70 to $78.50 per barrel respectively. For perspective, these hedges represent 12% of our daily third quarter oil volumes, 21% of our worldwide gas volumes and 36% of just our North American gas volumes. Before closing I wanted to note a subtle but important change taking place at Apache over a period of years. For most of our history Apache has lived hand to mouth largely dependent on the vagaries of the US gas market for our cash flow and earnings. And our balance portfolio approach has taken hold however, we diversified our sources of revenue and captured new opportunities for adding value. Today, we have a growing complement of meaningful discoveries in large scale projects around the world each of which can really move the needle. In years past we didn't have the wherewithal to spend $1 billion on infrastructure in Egypt's western dessert to bring to market a backlog of gas discovery. The weight for first cash flow would have been just too painful particularly with no free cash flow at the time. However, we've evolved in recent years and having actually made that investment we now flow as John indicated over three quarters of our BCF of gross gas in Egypt day in and day out with no decline for five or six years or even longer with the addition of new discoveries. We have similar high impact assets in Australia where our Reindeer discovery for example is on track to flow 60 million cubic feet of gas per day growth beginning in late 2011 for seven straight years without decline and with the potential for extending the contract further. Then going to go and Pyrenees while different in that production will peak in the first few years are similar in that they are significant large scale discoveries that once online add meaningful volumes some 40,000 barrels per day or so net to production during the first half of 2010. Our decision to saddle up with Chevron on the Wheatstone LNG project for the discoveries is another natural step in Apache's evolution toward large scale long lived impacted projects. We are cognizant of the need to balance these long-term capital intensive projects with near term investments that cash flow and pay the light bulbs but the prize in this case is 150 to 200 million cubic feet of net gas tied to oil prices every day for 15 years. That's not just the different type of asset, it's a company builder. (Inaudible) tells me that learning about low stock price multiples is Bush league so I won't go there but surprising to say that somewhere along the line Apache has grown into a very different and stronger company with a growing number of impactive high quality assets that create a solid foundation for continued profitable growth. Steve?
Steve Farris: Thank you, Roger. I'd like to close our comments by taking stock of a little bit of what Roger where it was delivering and building a pipeline of long large, long-term, stable and diverse energy projects. And I think all of you have probably seen a chart with the news in recently showing our major granite growth projects that are expected to contribute close to 140,000 barrels equivalent of new production to Apache by 2012. And those are the big projects we have been investing in during the recent quarters. If you visualize that diagram, we've delivered the Salon gas plant three and four in the Asala ridge waterfloods in Egypt. The Geauxpher development in the Gulf of Mexico during this year already. And that means we've done all the work and invested the capital required and as there are aggregate production, contribution of those projects will hold steady for a good number of years. As a result, we now have the benefit of those steady production in cash flow for an extended period. We've heard many times today the next tier of projects in our pipeline will benefit Apache's growth next year. That's Van Gogh and Pyrenees and also (inaudible) expected to come on stream and ramp up during 2010. In addition, we have a large and growing pipeline of major projects to support our growth beyond 2010. These include some of the things that Rod pointed out, Phiops discovery in Egypt, Halyard, Reindeer, Macedon, Coniston discoveries in Australia, and our fifth Salon plant in Egypt. And we are adding to go this pipeline steadily. This quarter alone we've added the Wheatstone as a major 15-year project. The Granite Wash as a resource play with literally hundreds of locations. I might point out that this entire pipeline is organically generated within our broad global portfolio and continues to be built through organic means we grow through the (inaudible). I would like to say that while major growth projects matter, Apache's real underlying momentum is all the wells we keep on drilling and recompleting across our asset base. And I know it becomes difficult to understand what on earth we're referring to as we fire away an endless series of names of discoveries and production enhancements projects around our global portfolio but that's who we are and the real activity that defines how we grow production and create value in this company and I believe we do it as well or better than anybody out there. I'd like to conclude by summarizing what I believe are our 25 plain messages this afternoon. Our production growth we've had record production growth for 2009. As Roger pointed out we'll probably plateau in the fourth quarter just because of some of our shut-ins that Rod mentioned but we've had great momentum in 2010 to continue to deliver growth in the years ahead. The Wheatstone LNG project gives us a 15-year steady plateau, 190 million cubic feet of gas and 5100 barrels of condensate per day which was stable cash flow contracted at oil link prices. We have entered into a contract to sell some gas out of Argentina for $5 an M, which further validates our view that Argentina for the long-term is going to be a good place to invest and we have a large resource potential in that country. We have a leading position in the Horn River basin which keeps getting better. John pointed out we are now looking at recoveries of 12 Bcf per well with 14 fracs and we're experimenting with even longer laterals and more fracs. That developments program will grow in 2010. And finally, we drilled our first granite wells that flowed 17 million per day, still flowing 17 million per day and 800 barrels of liquids. We have hundreds of locations across this play. Our initial plan is to drill 20 next year. And I'm very conscious that this is a lot of information but we have a lot of information to report. And I want to thank you for your patience and we'd like to turn it over to you for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we'll go first to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer: First question on Coniston, the wealth you highlighted earlier seems to have relatively high rates and I wondered if you could provide some more color on the resource potential there and capacity available that's leading to your decision to tie that project back versus potentially developed new infrastructure.
Steve Farris: We're constant and we drilled five wells to date and probably have another two or three wells to complete delineation structure when the rig returns to this area sometime in early December. We currently from our current view of the field from the first five wells we drilled and the test results for the two wells which I mentioned this is probably has a gross recoverable oil accumulation in the vicinity of about 35 to 40 million barrels. It's within 10 kilometers of the Van Gogh FPSO development so it's very likely and we of course early in the stages of doing the development assessment. But we very likely tie it to the Van Gogh FPSO.
Brian Singer: Secondly on Wheatstone, you had highlighted the potential for that project to development 2.1 Tcf. What do you see as your discovered resource at Julimar and Brunello as well as any nearby fields and how should we think about your interest in resource available for potential expansions beyond these first two trains?
Rod Eichler: Well, we have 2.14 Tcf which we referenced is our kind of our P50 reserve case. We have significant upside to that. We have a lot of satellite projects in the area which could access those production through that facility by virtue of their near proximity. In fact its one of the beauties of the Wheatstone development for us at LNG as it really allows us to bring a lot more of these previously discovered, but isolated accumulations into the marketplace.
Brian Singer: Maybe I missed it, do you have a sense of what that could represent? In other words, are there discoveries that you may not have deemed commercial in the past that could now become commercial above and beyond to the 2.1 Tcf?
Rod Eichler: A bunch are there in the (inaudible) area I which I mentioned, which is right next to the Van Gogh and Coniston and (inaudible) area is the gas development there. Probably four projects we've identified in there, we probably add up to 150 Bcf resource potential on our existing licenses, and we have others which could be delayed and also in the area between Pyrenees Island and the Wheatstone central production platform on existing lands. I don't have a number to give you this afternoon.
Operator: And we'll go next to David Tameron with Wells Fargo.
David Tameron: Can you comment on the acquisition market? I know it's something you talked about this time last year, then prices ran ahead of you. Can you talk about your current thoughts there?
Rod Eichler: Yeah, personally I think it's a little too early to the tell. We are more active as we said a number of times in looking for and at things to buy. I think we find ourselves in a good position with (inaudible) and Apache because we are very selective right now in terms of what we look at because we've got to weigh that against the opportunities that we have on our plate internally versus things that we're looking at. And quite frankly, the real bottomline is, we haven't found anything that competes with what we do for a living right now.
David Tameron: Any general feel for the market, are oil properties still tight? PV-10 [PAC] numbers, can you give me any color there?
Rod Eichler: While I can't say that there' is nothing that you can look at, and I will tell you, to be real honest with you, the value of the oil to reality is really better and the reason is because people don't have the same view of Mecca coming out there as they do on gas prices, because if you look at a lot of things that are happening out there and if you looked at the current date, the cash market today they don't make sense. You have to look at the strip which is why you see an awful lot of folks out there hedging, because you have to look at the strip to make those things economic. So, honestly the value difference between oil is much smaller than the value difference between gas right now.
David Tameron: And then, up in Ootla Horn River, can you talk about what's your current well cost? What are they running?
Rod Eichler: John?
John Crump: Well, we're still working on the 10 million per well but I think I have mentioned to some of you in the past, we tend to start experimenting and adding more fracs. We expect to get our per frac cost down to somewhere in the range of $300,000 per when we start this program, because we're going to have our own water supply and that's been a big cost element in our past jobs, we've had to haul water in with trucks.
David Tameron: Okay. And right now those fracs are running what 600 or 700?
John Crump: Yes, absolutely.
David Tameron: All right. That's all and we talked in, did you are say you want to get the 10 million. You are not at 10 million today yet, are you?
John Crump: No. We weren't at 10 million on the ones we've drilled earlier this year. But again, we're having to truck water in and doing less jobs. You can imagine we are about to start on a program where we'll do 16 wells with some 14, 15 fracs per well. So, that gives you some benefits of scale that we have not been able to take advantage of in the past.
Operator: Next, Joe Allman with JP Morgan.
Joe Allman: In the Granite Wash, what is your net acreage there?
John Crump: We've got roughly 75,000 acres of net, but we were in a position to, you're probably aware in Oklahoma you can propose a well with any amount of acreage in a section. So, we would expect to pick up additional acreage going forward with well proposals.
Joe Allman: And then back to the Horn River basin. I think John you said something about an additional 11 million per day. I just kind of missed what you were saying. Can you talk about that?
John Crump: Yeah I am sorry. I probably didn't make that clear. We are making $24 million a day out of those four wells that we completed this year. The six wells that we did last year make it another $11 million.
Joe Allman: And then sticking with the Horn River Basin, could you help with the economics? What price do you think you need to get an adequate rate of return? And just help us on the decision to sends some gas through LNG versus any through pipe and what the costs involved there are?
John Crump: Well I think we've shown you some numbers in the past in some presentations where we're around $4 at kind of a break-even point and obviously, that's going to be a little bit of kissing your sister at that number, but we can make it work there especially if we can drive out additional cost. And it tends to be a little bit of a chicken leg thing as realizations go down, we drive the cost down and we get it over the line that way. Obviously, we'd like to get $5, $6, $7. That's why we've hedged some of that gas this year.
Joe Allman: And then just very quickly in Egypt. There are three types of wells that you're drilling there, Upper Bahariya AB in Jurassic. Is the cost sort of on average for those three about $3.5 million and remind us what the average reserves per well you're getting there?
John Crump: Well, there's quite a bit of difference in depth between the three zones. Most of Bahariya development work is typically in the 6,000 to 8,000 foot range and those wells can be as cheap to drill and complete as $1.5 million, $2 million. The AEB wells are typically drilled between 10,000 and 12,000 feet. You are looking at probably $2 to $2.5 million for those wells and the Jurassic wells that can be from 12,000 to 14,000 feet. You're probably looking upwards of $3 million to drill and complete those wells. As far as the reserve sizes go, individual Bahariya wells, for instance the mature waterflood areas of (inaudible) in vicinity of 100,000 to 125,000 net barrels of oil reserves per well, but of course we have hundreds of those wells there. Those are the shallowest wells that we can drill and complete inside of like ten days. These range up to the higher end reserves which can be few hundred thousand barrels per well in the East Bahariya developments which are under active waterflood right now and if the primary successes there have been very significant, that we developed in 2007-2008, again 2009. And then lastly the Jurassic wells, the reserve range all the way from the big (inaudible) wells which have daily rates that can test from $40 million to 50 million per day plus large degrees of condensate. The number of typical Jurassic well would probably be in the 3 to 5 million barrels of oil equivalent per well.
Operator: And we'll go next to David Heikkinen with Tudor Pickering Holt.
David Heikkinen: Just following up as you think about Egypt and what you've done with the waterflood volumes growing over the last several years, how would you think about continued waterflood growth over the next year and two years on an annual basis?
John Crump: In waterflood program we current have about very 40 active waterflood projects and the oil reservoirs really have done themselves well to this kind of secondary recovery, and we intend to keep growing that. In fact we've been successful in bringing up that waterflood oil volume up to about 70,000 barrels a day currently at about the 160,000 to 170,000 barrels a day we produce gross. And that includes condensate. So, if you back out the condensate about half of our daily oil production, the black oil production of Egypt comes from waterfloods and secondary recovery activities. We would like to continue to grow that because it really flattens the normal decline that you normally see on primary producing wells and this will give us a nice firm base going forward. These fields are, for the most part the most recent fields which we have some 14 or 15 waterflood projects underway right now our the newest and as a result have very long lives of long flood production plateaus.
David Heikkinen: And you are not waterflooding the A, B just in the area?
John Crump: (Inaudible) saw the water so that two of these in the activity is in the Baja. We had some activity AEB in the called area. The bulk of our activity and most of oil volumes right now is coming out of the east Baja area which is principally from (inaudible) Bahariya sands.
David Heikkinen: And then maybe on the Horn River basin as you think about increasing reserves for well I always get curious about how do you think about original gas in place now and kind of percentage of gas recovery and that would then lead to a number of wells per section?
John Crum: Yeah, David, some of these exercises I mentioned we are going to be doing some more experimenting between ourselves and our partner we certainly are looking into a lot of things to increase the recovery that you would expect out of the area. I don't know that we are really changing our in place numbers. I guess there is still some debate about what that number is. What we certainly know about horizontal and multi-frac technology is as we drill the wells closer together and put more fracs in it we are going to recover higher percentages of the original gas in place. So the real key here is just get into that optimum number where you are spacing between the wells is getting as much gas as is economic to do and not wasting any more than possible. So obviously we could put a frac every 50 feet and recover even more but that's probably not economic.
David Heikkinen: How do you think about the 16 wells that you're drilling, what spacing are you putting those on?
John Crum: Well, the 16 wells that we just drilled we are on roughly 250-meters between the wells. And then putting, we had planned on putting 14 fracs. Now we'll tell you, we drilled two wells on the 16 well pad. We went up to 2200 meters of length where we had been at 1600 meters. So we will be doing some experimenting on those longer reach ones. On the pad that we are going to, we are going to take half the pad and take the spacing out to 350 meters and another half the pad and take it to 400-meters between wells. And that's where the real wind can come from. We think we can get the frac length to connect between the two wells, if we can stretch out that space and get longer reaches then obviously we will take less well bores to recover the same amount of gas.
David Heikkinen: Okay. And then on as you think about gas discovered in Australia jumping around a little bit what would you say your P90 resource is so far tied to Wheatstone, injuring it's probably in the 1.6 to 1.9 TCF range.
Steve Farris: P90 is 1.6 to 1.9 and P50 is the 2.14 that seems like a pretty tight range, is that fair?
David Heikkinen: Well, the P50 is 2.1.
Steve Farris: Okay.
Steve Farris: It is, let's back up. The P50 is right now based on what we drilled, okay? So what you're looking for is additional gas drainage out of existing oil bores or existing in the area. With still have some other thing to drill out there.
David Heikkinen: I was thinking about a distribution of what you've already drilled but that 1.6 to 1.9 thanks.
Operator: And we'll go next to Leo Mariano with RBC.
Leo Mariano: Good afternoon here, guys. A question about Argentina. You guys have this $5 GAAP plus projects that you're working on. You talked about drilling it sounded like pretty close to 50 wells between the two projects over the next three years. Curious as to how much incremental reserves and production you guys think that can drive and when you expect some of that production to come online and what the costs are associated with that?
John Crum: We believe the production online pretty quick in this area because we have infrastructure and these are all mostly in premature development areas so hook-ups are pretty quick. These wells as you heard are relatively shallow. They range anywhere from 3,000, 8,000 feet in most of those gas plus project areas. So those are pretty quick. Just a matter of applying the capital to be able to have the rigs to do it. We've had a pretty soft capital program down there this year which we are now ramping back up, now that we've had some agreements with the sales and industry or other operators with the government and the labor factions to be able to bring up production and make increase investment and exchange for these incentives for increased gas pricing.
Leo Mariano: Okay. So what's your estimate of reserves you guys can bring online with that program over the next couple of years?
Rod Eichler: That was a number of wells we have drilled. We report a modest decline each quarter of this year mostly because of the natural decline in the production. We would be able overcome that very easily by drilling more wells. We also had a large number of waterflood opportunities in Argentina. So it's pretty straight forward economics. I mean I don't have, it's quite a range of the program we have down there to be able to specify a certain reserve per well number.
Leo Mariano: Okay. I'm just trying to get a better sense of what the kind of incremental economics are. You guys mention that at current pricing they don't work but it's $5 that work so I'm trying to get a sense of where in between the brake even is and how much money you're making?
Rob Eichler: Current pricing in Argentina depending on what market you are selling the gas into can anywhere be from 80 cents to $2. So $5 is a pretty good deal.
Leo Mariano: Okay. I guess jumping over to the Horn River basin here you guys have talked about trying to bring 27 wells on in the second quarter of '10. I'm just curious as to whether or not you guys are going to have any restructuring production constraint to that point in time or you think you are going to be able to flow all those wells full bore.
John Crum: I think we will have to bring them on a little bit at a time if we get the results we've been getting you couldn't bring all 27 on obviously at the same time but of course we will bring on one pad at a time. We think that we are in pretty good shape on take away capacity in the Horn River basin into 2011.
Leo Mariano: I was going to say what is that take away capacity you guys expect in 2010 out there in Horn River?
John Crum: Well, we are still trying to put the schedule together on exactly how we'd do it but we have actually signed up for 100 million per day capacity through Spectra and we expect to pick up and whatever, that's net to us and Canada has done the same so that can expect to pick up some additional capacity of required from spare that they have available.
Leo Mariano: Okay. Looking at Egypt obviously you guys have had really strong growth there the last several quarters as you brought on Salon and you had a couple of oil discoveries got your waterfloods ramped up. Just curious if you can talk qualitatively to what the production ramp is going to look like in Egypt in 2010. Are we going to be kind of growing slower from here as just more of your oil comes online or what can we expect there?
Rob Eichler: In terms of the budgeting process right now for 2010 but I expect that based on our the inventory that did not get drilled in 2009 based on our capital restrictions this year that's all carried over 2010 plus the new projects I expect to return to a level of drilling activity very similar to what we experienced in 2008. Continued growth in production as I mentioned the Phiops field development is very significant or very likely to get to 20,000 barrels per day by mid third quarter of 2010 and we expect to expand the facilities even beyond that because it's a little bit remote area just to the west of our normal operating operations in (Inaudible). So I expect a continued good growth in Egypt from 2010.
John Crum: Now from a gas standpoint. I had mentioned a number of big gas wells the last couple of conference calls we've had and we are starting to get to the point where we are getting gas back up with all those infrastructure improvements and so we are actively working on a Salon gas train five scenario and additional pipe lining that would be coming on in two years hence or three years from now so that's all in the works working with the government to try to develop those similar ideas. Ourselves as well as other operator they have stranded gas from the area. in the area. Right now we are able to manage our gas streams to maximize our liquid production. So we are rotating our gas wells to be able to maximize condensate productions in the new plants.
Leo Mariano: I guess final question on the North Sea here. Obviously had really strong production in the third quarter. You mentioned hitting another sort of undiscovered pocket kind of adding some reserves up there. Just curious as to what you folks think the reserve upside is up there. I know you got some pretty detailed models out there?
Rod Eichler: All right. We have a rather exhaustive development model for the 40s fields. It's almost a 5 billion barrel oil in place field which a couple bill barrels have been recovered and there's a significant amount of oil to be targeted to be recovered to ongoing operations which we've been very successful or ramping up our drilling program based on application for the seismic to target the unswept zones or pods that have not been swept by our long-time waterflood activity there. More and more we continue to fine-tune our work based on our field development model. I see a very robust inventory of drilling opportunities in (inaudible) field going forward. Even though we drilled a number of wells this year, I see a healthy drilling program going forward with a lot of new prospect ideas such as brim and sand prospect which was intentionally targeted in the field and (Inaudible) is a good place and will yield good opportunities.
Operator: Our final question comes from Joe Magner with Macquarie.
Joe Magner: Good afternoon, thanks. I apologize if I missed the details earlier. Two questions. When do you think you will be in a position to provide preliminary volume growth in CapEx guidance for next year? And then, second, with growing contribution from numerous large multiyear projects, what should we think about in terms of longer term average production rates or sort of minimum rates going forward?
John Crum: Well, we are going through our, truthfully we are going through our planning cycle right now. We should be in a position by the end of November to start talking a little bit about what we are seeing with respect to our growth for 2010. And on a long-term basis, you know, we historically have not given long-term guidance. I think what we've said at least at our Apache conference in Houston a year and a half ago that based on the opportunities that we have and the projects that we have depending on how much capital question throw at it we can grow at double digits for the next four years. So but that is all dependent on how much capital you spend.
Operator: And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn it back to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Tom Chambers: I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today and I will be in my office if anybody has any further questions after the call. Thanks.
Operator: And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to the Apache Corporation second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Today's presentation will be hosted by Mr. Tom Chambers, Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor Relations. 
Tom Chambers: This morning we reported second quarter net income of $443 million or a $1.31 per diluted share, and cash flow of $1.26 billion. On today's call we'll have four speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. Steve Farris our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will open up the session, followed by Rod Eichler our Co-Chief Operating Officer and President of International, John Crum our Co-Chief Operating Officer and President of North America, and Roger B. Plan our President. Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions and no assurance can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer can be found on our website. Any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations, or cost incurred will be identified as such with the reconciliation located on our website at www.apachecorp.com.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
G. Steven Farris: I'd like to give you some highlights of our performance during the quarter and then I'd like to comment a little bit on the outlook for the rest of the year. Apache's performance during the quarter reflects the clear benefits of our geologic and geographical diversity, as well as our balanced product mix. Apache's production grew at 7.1% over the previous quarter and up 6.5% from the second quarter of 2008. And this strong growth performance was broad-based across our portfolio.  On the exploration side, we had yet another outstanding quarter. Our continued exploration success in Egypt brings our discoveries tested to date bear at about 70 million barrels of oil equivalent on a crude [plus] probable basis. I might point out the majority of that is oil. And you'll hear shortly from John Crumb, we also had important exploration successes during the quarter in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Ootla resource play in Canada.  On the development front, we achieved our objectives during the quarter bringing the Geauxpher deepwater project on stream in the Gulf of Mexico, and completing the ramp of our latest new gas facilities in Egypt.  In addition our North Sea team tested a new development well at 10,500 barrels a day in the 40s field. This is pretty amazing when you consider that 40s was producing approximately 40,000 barrels per day when we acquired it in 2003. We'll continue to work through our expanding development drilling inventory there, which at the moment, consists of 77 unique targets.  I will note quickly that we're pleased with our ability to deliver reductions in our operating cost during the quarter. I certainly wouldn't say we're satisfied on that front so far. We continue to push the service companies and push ourselves for even greater efficiencies. Turing to the outlook, as you can see from our performance during the quarter, our portfolio provides us with running room for strong production growth, and we continue to believe we'll be between 6% and 14% production growth for the year. Van Gogh project delay due to the FPSO's company yard incident that pushed us to the bottom end of that range. But with our region's outstanding performance thus far this year, our growth will solely be determined by how much capital we make available through our regions in the rest of the year. We continue to add to our organic resource depth for the long-term. Every additional well we drill at Ootla adds to our conviction that we hold one of the largest and highest quality plays in North America.  We've received numerous inquires about the Granite Wash, which is in the panhandle of Texas and Oklahoma. And John's going to comment about our position there in a little more detail, but generally let me say we believe we hold one of the largest acreage positions in that play, if not the largest.  We hold and continue to build other areas that, based on our experience thus far, could be second to none in quality and resource scale. Frankly, we prefer to focus on delivering operational results instead of extrapolating hypothetical numbers about early stage plays, which probably doesn't do us any good in the market front. Importantly, our natural gas resource plays are either held by production or through long leases. So we're not under any pressure to drill hundreds of wells at current depressed prices. We have the choice instead of maximizing value for our shareholders by focusing on near tier development capital on other growth opportunities while making sure, of course, that we capture the highest quality gas opportunities for the longer term.  Our debt to balance growth opportunities and financial strength means that we can also participate in the asset market, but only when it creates the most value for Apache. During the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of our Marathon Permian properties, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities by applying our core values of discipline, patience in a contrarian's spirit that has served us well in increasing the equity value of Apache from a little over $4 billion ten years ago to $26 billion today.  So now I'd like to turn it over to Rod and John and Roger. 
Rodney J. Eichler : I would now like to provide a quick overview of our main developments in our international regions. During the second quarter of production from Apache's International Operations with 302,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 9.5% increase over first quarter. The production increase can be attributed to drilling successes in Egypt and the North Sea, as well as completion of facility repairs at Australia's Marinas Island, and successful commissioning of new gas plants in Egypt.  In Egypt, net production was 158,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 15.9% increase over first quarter. The region achieved new daily production records for gross oil and condensate at 163,000 barrels per day, and gross gas at 754 million per day.  On the exploration side, we completed drilling and/or testing operations on five new wildcat wells resulting in two new field discoveries during the second quarter. Two potential discoveries at Cordova and Chelsea will be tested within the next few weeks, and three Jurassic wildcat wells are presently drilling. Apache has a 100% contractor working interest in all of these wells. Some brief highlights on the two discoveries and significant appraisal and development wells in the greater call to concessionary are as follows. The [Nies] 1X wildcat and the call to offset concession log 82 feet of oil pay in the Jurassic Safa sand section. The Safa tested at 1,460 barrels of oil per day. A plan of development has been submitted to the government and production expected to commence the fourth quarter. The Falcon-1X wildcat in the Matruh Concession logged 38 net feet of pay in the Jurassic Safa sand, 47 feet in the AEB6 sands, and 44 feet in the AEB3D sands. The [S] rates were 11 million a day in the Safa, 35 million a day and 2,000 barrels of condensate per day in the AEB6 and 4,400 barrels of well per day in AEB3D. The well will be initially completed in the AED3D oil zone and first production from the well should commence in the early third quarter.  The Hydra-5X appraisal well, two kilometers south of updip of the 2008 Hydra-1X Discovery well the in the Shushan Concession logs 50 feet of Jurassic upper Safa sand pay and test did 3,700 barrels of oil per day and 21 million cubic feet of gas per day. A new field pay zone. The well also has 40 feet of AEB6 pay a hole. The field will be developed upon completion of a gas sales agreement with the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation.  The Phiops-5X was drilled to appraise and develop the AEB oil reserves found in the Phiops-1X discovery well that was made in the first quarter. The Phiops-5X logged 242 feet of net pay in the AEB and tested 8,300 barrels of oil per day from the AEB3E and AEB3Z reservoirs. Three additional Phiops field wells are in the process of drilling or testing. Amendments to our Sema Salon and West Gaza exploration sessions for an additional three years, to 2013 were approved by Parliament in June. These concessions encompass 3.8 million gross acres which Apache operates with a 50% contractor interest. Apache's first well in the West Gaza concession should split in October.  On the development side in Egypt 72 hour performance tasks were successfully completed at the new Salon gas plants three and four, and the northern pipeline compression project became fully operational. Gross call to gas production averaged 668 million a day during June and 715 million a day in July. Upon completion of commissioning related adjustments in early August, we expect gross gas production from the Caldara area concessions to average 730 million a day for the balance of the year, a 25% increase from the $540 million a day at the end of the first quarter. Turning to Australia, net production was 37,300 barrels of oil equivalent a day, an18.5% increase over first quarter, gas and oil production increased by 13% and 34% respectively. The Varanus Island repair project was essentially completed by the end of the quarter when net oil and gas production exceeded pre-incident levels of 10,000 barrels of oil per day and 195 million cubic feet of gas per day. Current net production rates exceed 200 million a day. In our Van Gogh oil project, the Van Gogh 6H Development well and Van Gogh 12 water injector were completed. Repair work for the FPSO as a result of April's control room fire are well underway and we estimate first production at Van Gogh around year-end. On the exploration side in Australia, we drilled two new wells in the multi-Tcf Julimar-Brunello complex. [Valnase-1], a gas exploration well, was drilled to investigate two previously untested channel fans up among the root formation. The well encountered 6.7 meters of net gas pay in the B10 sand and 19.5 meters of net oil pay in the B20 sand. [Valnase-2], a gas appraisal well, found 15 meters of net gas pay in the B10 sand and 2 meters of oil pay and an oil water contact in the B20 sand. Now this oil pay is in communication with the oil pay in the B20 and [Valnase-1], thus confirming the 43 meter oil column with an additional 60 meters of probable oil column updip of [Valnase-1]. We are presently evaluating all options to commercialize this large gas resource and our process will be complete by year-end. In the North Sea, net production averaged 60,000 water barrels of oil equivalent a day, a decrease of 1% from first quarter, due to a planned 16-day build delta platform turnaround that commenced in May. Delta platform makes 16,000 barrels of oil per day. Excluding the Delta turnaround, production would have been up a net 1,226 barrels of oil per day quarter-on-quarter. Production efficiency of the 40s field was 93% during the quarter, excluding the turnaround downtime a 37% field-wide gain since our acquisition of the field in 2003. On the drilling side, we completed four successful oil development wells during the quarter. These wells contributed 2,740 barrels of oil per day for the quarter and 6,460 barrels of oil per day in June. As Steve mentioned, of note is the 40s Charlie 63 well which encountered 34 meters of pay and was brought on production in mid-June at 10,500 barrels of oil per day. This initial rate is the fields highest since 1994. We are currently drilling one development well in 40s Alpha 42 and to putting an additional industrial oil development to 40s Charlie 54 which will be on production in August. At the close of the quarter, 40s Field was producing at sustained rates in excess of 70,000 barrels a day, the field's highest stable production output since February 2006. In Argentina, net production was 47,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down less than 1% from first quarter. For the first half, 21 wells were drilled with a success rate of 95%. The Neuquen Province development drilling continued in Guanaco and Ranquil gas field areas. Both fields are approved to receive gas plus price incentives by the federal government. The Ranquil Co 1039 encountered 110 meters of pay in three zones in the objective [inaudible] formation. Completion operations are currently underway. In the Guanaco field, five wells have been drilled to date in 2009, four wells are on production, and the fifth is currently being completed. Four additional wells are planned in Guanaco and Ranquil Co in the second half. In Tierra del Fuego's Austral basin, the successful Springhill oil well has completed for 900 barrels a day in the Seccion Banos field. The well helped define the field's secondary recovery potential for a waterflood that will be commenced by year-end.  I'd now like to turn over the presentation to John Crum who will discuss activities in our North America operations.
John A. Crum : Starting with our central region, our central region produced 87,700 barrels of equivalent per day in the second quarter, down 2.2% from the first quarter due primarily to natural well declines with little new drilling activity. The region rig activity was deliberately slowed in the first two quarters of 2009 to wait until drilling and well service costs dropped to a level more consistent with lower oil and gas prices. With reduced activity levels, the region concentrated on building their inventory of opportunities and proceeded with lower cost projects targeting primarily oil such as waterflood expansions. In spite of the production drop, the regions cost reduction efforts resulted in LOE costs per Boe dropping by 1.8% during the quarter. An example of the project we proceeded with was at our [Means] Grayburg Waterflood project in Andrews County, Texas. We began a waterflood expansion that will ultimately entail seven conversions to injection and two new producing wells. This project is expected to develop over 700,000 barrels of oil. Field work on the conversion started during the second quarter with three of the conversions. The remainder of the work will be completed in the second half. Also, further evaluation of our recent Marathon Permian basin acquisition, which closed late last quarter, confirmed attractive drilling targets for oil, especially in southeast New Mexico where we just [sanctioned] 10 well programs. We are particularly enthusiastic about our position in the emerging horizontal Granite Wash gas play in the Anadarko Basin. Most of you would be aware that this has been a core area for Apache for decades. We own interests in almost 2,000 acres in the play area. We have drilled more than 100 successful vertical Granite Wash wells over the past five years and know these rocks well. Dozens of horizontal wells have now been drilled with initial rates above 10 million feet of gas per day, significantly reducing our risk as we begin rigorous evaluation of the horizontal potential on our acreage. We are presently drilling our first operative horizontal Granite Wash well, offsetting several recent industry successes. Apache has also identified other horizontal gas and oil plays on our acreage and will be testing these over the remainder of 2009 and into 2010. The central region is really starting to see the cost reductions we were looking for to improve the economics of our drilling programs. With our huge HBP acreage position, as Steve alluded to in the Anadarko and Permian Basins, has allowed us to defer activity until costs reflect the level of product prices we are experiencing. As indicated, we believe we can drill and complete a well today for roughly two-thirds of last year's costs. In some surfaces, cost reductions are continuing to drop. Early this month, we fracture stimulated the deep Springer well for $215,000. The same job last year cost us $625,000. Work-over rig hourly rates are down 35% in the Anadarko and 30% in the Permian Basins. We entered the second half of the year with 70% of the region's budget unspent. We are now accelerating our drilling and work-over programs and will concentrate on relatively shallow Permian Basin oil prospects, especially in our prolific units of southeast New Mexico. We are currently evaluating the addition of two more drilling rigs and expect to significantly increase our recondition rig activity.  Moving to the Gulf Coast, the Gulf Coast region produced an average of 116,800 barrels equivalent per day during the second quarter, up 12.2% from the first quarter, a figure of $104,000. Hurricane related production restoration added 5,100 barrels to the first quarter number and Geauxpher Fields first production added another 3,100 barrels per day, while new completions and operations capital projects added another 6,200 barrels equivalent per day to the first quarter figures and offset the natural declines. At the same time, lifting costs for Boe dropped by 9.5% from first to second quarters. Our much anticipated 40%-owned Geauxpher development came online May 15th and has already produced 7.5 Bcf to date. And the two-well field continues to flow at 105 million cubic feet of gas per day. Our 100%-owned South Timbalier 287AA sidetrack resulted in a discovery. The discovery was drilled from Apache South Timbalier 308 platform into the adjoining block. This high angle well was drilled to 23,000 feet measured depth and logged 40 feet of net oil pay. The well tested at 1,971 barrels of oil per day and 8.6 million cubic feet of gas per day with over 7,000 pounds of flowing tubing pressure during that second quarter. It was brought on production May 13th and continues to produce today at near test rate levels. Hurricane restoration efforts, primarily associated with third party infrastructure repairs, continue. We expect to recover an additional 8,800 barrels equivalent per day in the third quarter.  On the cost front, we continue to see further reductions in rig rates. Some of you will have noted that the flow-to-rig count now exceeds jack-ups in the Gulf of Mexico. Jack-up rig activity is now under 20 rigs from the more traditional 100 rig level. As a result, boats are now well under half of last year's rates and we are seeing similar cost reductions for support vessels. Moving to Canada, our Canada region produced 80,186 barrels equivalent per day, up 2.8% from the first quarter, primarily associated with new production from our winter drilling programs from those producing for most of the quarter and offsetting those natural declines. Meanwhile, the region was also successful in reducing LOE per barrel equivalent by 7.7%. Continued weak gas prices and the high cost environment has continued to slow our development drilling activity in Canada. We have drilled a total of 118 development wells through the first half, but with very little activity during the second quarter. We plan to drill another 53 development wells in the second half but primarily for oil targets.  The province of Alberta has attempted to recover from the dramatic drop in rig activity associated with weak product prices and their ill-advised royalty increase of last year. The province has implemented a royalty incentive limiting royalties to 5% for the first year if the well is completed before April 1, 2011 as well as a $200 per meter drill royalty credit.  We continue to evaluate our substantial prospect inventory with these incentives in mind but we'll generally need more cost relief and/or higher gas prices to increase our development activity substantially. Again, this acreage is held by production and it'll still be there when prices increase.  Drilling for the remainder of the year will focus on oil development opportunities at Zama, Midale and the House Mountain fields. With our partner EnCana our Horn River or as we call it the Ootla shale activity remained high during the quarter. We currently have six Muskwa wells on from the 2008 program and their producing 14 million a day after more than a year on production on average.  Those wells were completed with 6 to 10 fracs of bearings sizes. The first three wells from the EnCana operated 2009 program are now in production with a total of 26 million feet of gas per day being produced after more than three weeks on average. A fourth well is expected to be on production within the next week.  The production rates experienced to date have confirmed our estimations that we can expect ultimate recoveries of over 10 Bcf per well. EnCana we'll finish the drilling of another 11 wells while Apache finishes our 16 well program on the 70K pad by the end of this third quarter. Completion operations for those wells will commence late this year and we would expect to be ready for first production by the end of the first quarter 2010 from those wells.  We are quite pleased with the improved efficiencies that we've been able to achieve as we learn more. Drilling times have improved to as little as 16 days from our original estimation of 30 days. On the infrastructure side, the partners commission the C67K Dehydration compressor facility in late June and the new 42 mile by 24 inch sales gas line with the capacity of over 700 million cubic feet per day was put into service transporting gas from the C67K facility to Spectra's Interconnect near the proposed Capital Lake Gas Plant site.  To get the project started we have hedged a net 50 million to 100 million feet of gas per day over the next three years at $6 to $7 per Mcf. Given continued soft gas prices the partners will need to continue to look for ways to reduce cost to make this play very competitive. We believe, however, that with the results to date and our acreage position, we will be able to drill some 2,000 to 3,000 gross wells per multi-well pads over the next several decades.  Now, I'd like to turn this over to Roger Plank. 
Roger B. Plank : Apache turned in strong second quarter results in the face of oil and gas realization that were cut in half from a year ago. Mitigating the price impact were the higher production and lower costs mentioned earlier. Relative to last years second quarter our 6.5% production increase was accompanied by 16% lower operating expenses or $250 million reduction.  The progress in our results is most evident when compared to the first quarter. Earnings adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations on deferred taxes and impairments more than doubled to $474 million or $1.41 per share and cash flow jumped 28% to $1.25 billion for the quarter.  Frankly, these results beat even our internal expectations for several reasons. Our 7% production increase sequentially was stronger than anticipated primarily in our Egyptian and Gulf regions. Higher production contributed to substantially lower than anticipated cash cost per unit produced.  But the primary thing that differentiates Apache's results this quarter is our strategy of diversified production and revenue sources. We're all painfully aware that North American gas prices fell significantly during the quarter, in our case realizations dropped some $0.73 per Mcf or 16% from the first quarter.  Given the market's myopic focus on North American natural gas it may come as somewhat of a surprise that Apache's equivalent realizations for oil and gas rose 19% during the quarter. Obviously being half oil helped. Realizations climbed 37% from first quarter to $58.15 per barrel.  Interestingly, however, our international gas which has now grown to over 40% of our worldwide gas production, also increased in price by 8%. This, coupled with higher production, enabled Apache's second quarter gas revenues to stay within $1 million of per quarter levels at $560 million. By holding the line on gas revenue we were able to enjoy the full benefit of our higher oil and liquids revenue, which jumped by 45% from first quarter. Oil added nearly half a billion dollars of revenue, and drove total revenues up 28% to over $2 million.  At the same time costs went the other way. Lease operating expense for BOE was driven 6% lower than the first quarter to $7.58 and should remain below $8.00 for the foreseeable future. Full cost DD&A of $9.86 per BOE was down 9%. G&A per BOE of $1.70 was down 1% sequentially despite $0.26 of severance related cost for our recent right sizing efforts. Absent nonrecurring items, future unit cost is expected to fall below last year's average of $1.48.  Finance cost decreased $0.05 a barrel equivalent to $1.14 on higher production volumes, while taxes other than income rose with oil prices by 23% to $2.17 per BOE, driven primarily by a petroleum revenue tax in the North Sea. Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to maintain our financial flexibility with debt-to-cap below 25% and over $750 million of available cash. Given rising production and current prices we anticipate cash balances to return to over $1 billion by year end, absent increases in capital spending or additional acquisitions. Now that's a lot of information and detail and I think the important point is that for over 50 years Apache has made a business out of not following the pack, choosing instead to build a balanced international portfolio that delivers consistent results, and gives us competitive advantage over those tied to the vagaries of a single product price. The merit in that approach was evident in our second quarter results and they speak for themselves.  I'll now turn it back over to Steve for closing remarks.
G. Steven Farris: And I'd like to close maybe on the same vein that Roger ended his, to re-emphasize the point that we feel obviously is sufficiently recognized in the market, and that's the competitive strength of our portfolio balance. Roger pointed that NYMEX gas price fell 26% from the previous quarter, yet our barrel of oil equivalent revenues increased by 19%, and that's both because of our international gas prices increasing as well as oil, obviously, increasing. It's been brought to my attention recently that we are the largest international producer among U.S. independents, whether you look at production outside the United States or production outside North America. Further, our production is equally balanced between oil and gas and we have a deep resource and opportunity base for all our regions, given our position of strength as a result of many years of staying true to our contrarian spirit, our long-term perspective, discipline and operation focus. We continue to be dedicated to generate long-term growth and value for our shareholders and with that we'll turn it over to questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs: I wanted to follow up on your point on acquisitions. I just wanted to see where you stand in terms of the importance to Apache, how bid-asks are and the importance of adding new U.S. shale assets to the portfolio?
G. Steven Farris: Well, everybody continues to believe that Mecca's out there, Brian, somewhere and the bid and the ask will stay pretty far apart. Although I will tell you we don't go to auctions so most of the things we look at are negotiated so that the auction process doesn't enter into the picture. With respect to shale gas in the United States, obviously we continue to look. I would think that's probably something that you'd have to look up and we'd tell you we did it rather than explain that we're doing it.
Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs: And then just thinking about Australia, can you talk about how you're thinking, or your latest thoughts on sourcing Julimar/Brunella, etc. and the potential participation and status of LNG liquefaction?
G. Steven Farris: Well, I don't think it's any secret that there's two competing LNG facilities that are going in there, by two major LNG producers in the world, and we are very closely approaching a time then when we're going to have to get to the point where we decide which one that we are going to go with, and that should probably happen this year.
Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs: And do you think you would sign a supply contract for off-take or participate in that at the same time? Or would it initially be more of a commitment to participate just in the liquefaction with a supply contract to be signed at a later date?
G. Steven Farris: Well, I think they have to go together to some extent. You certainly don't want to commit to the facility – where both of those projects are today is they're going into final engineering and design and a FID or actually investment decision, final investment decision probably won't be made for 18 months. So what we're looking at right now is which party that makes the most sense for us, assuming we don't take it to the domestic market, which party to us makes the most sense for us in the long term. And then it's going to be a process.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate – Howard Weil Inc.
Doug Leggate – Howard Weil Inc.: A couple of questions, first one is on Egypt and the second one is on the IPLA. First of all on Egypt, it seems that we all get kind of caught up looking at nonconventional opportunities here in the U.S., but you've obviously had extraordinary success over there. Can you kind of characterize, where are you now in terms of your prospect inventory? How should we think about the risking the reserves potential and ultimately can you just kind of characterize what the drilling looks like, and not just this year but whether or not you're going to recommit additional capital given how successful that program's been? And my follow-up is on the IPLA.
Roger B. Plank: Well, in Egypt the project portfolio remains very robust. We'll drill 19 wildcat wells this year. We've put seven or eight down and 12 yet to go. It's a combination of oil and gas program there for the exploration drilling. That will be out of a total program of about 160 wells for the year. We have a substantial inventory. At any given time there's at least twice that number and it's constantly replenished with additional opportunities as we progress with additional treaties, seismic surveys over our large concession holdings in the western desert.
Doug Leggate – Howard Weil Inc.: Roger, are these the street targets? I mean, is it as simple as saying typically we're looking at, I don't know, 5 million, 6 million barrel type of targets, oil equivalent, or is it something much more complex than that, given the multiple [plays] that you've seen over there?
Roger B. Plank: Well, it ranges from the 3 million to 5 million barrel. I'm sure there's plenty of those up to the multi DCF-type, [Kasser] type opportunities, and the Matruh development lease is an example. We have a very consistent track record there. Just about every accumulation that we have tapped there – our 3Ds – has been in the 12 million to 14 million barrel of oil equivalent range in terms of recoverable size.  And the key thing in each of the western desert is repeatability, both of the individual prospects as well as the amount of up-hole pace, which we frequently encounter being able to get and provide many work over opportunities in the future pre-completion.
Doug Leggate – Howard Weil Inc.: Well, I guess the question sort of then, Steve, is are you ready to recommit capital or additional capital? Or is the program just going to continue at that kind of current run rate?
G. Steven Farris: Well, obviously we went – our cash flow across this company went down about 50%, so what we cut capital about $3 billion out of last year's capital, somewhat across the board although there were a couple of variables, Egypt being one of them that wasn't cut nearly as much. We spent about $1.5 billion in 2008. We'll spend about $750 million to $800 million in Egypt this year and I can't imagine next year's program will be anything less than that for 2010. And the reason we spent so much in 2008 was because we had those two gas plants. We paid – the majority of the money that we – that those plants cost, really hit us in 2008.
Doug Leggate – Howard Weil Inc.: And if I could just ask a follow-up then, this question's for John; it's on the IPLA. I guess the comments on hedging, is that how we should think about the sort of ceiling on your activity level in terms of the production levels you expect to get to? And I imagine the economics are still pretty challenging, or should we think you're going to go a little more aggressive up there than those volumes currently suggest?
John A. Crum: Doug, we're continuing to look at that obviously as we go forward. The bottom line is we felt pretty comfortable putting those hedges in place. It certainly makes the early part of this program pretty robust economics.  Looking out further we obviously are trying to push this to make the numbers make it without a hedging program. So obviously if it works that way it'll work quite well if you hold gas prices a little higher. So that's been the drill. We continue to find ways to reduce the costs there, but there is no question you need to have reasonable gas prices to make this thing become the play we want it to be.
Doug Leggate – Howard Weil Inc.: Are we at breakeven yet, John?
John A. Crum: Well, we think so, but it depends what you need as a gas price, so if I just had to characterize a number we think we need Henry Hub to be somewhere in the $3.50 to $4.00 range for us to kind of come out even. Anything less than that we're going to have to get our cost out.
Operator: Our next question is from David Heikkinen – Tudor Pickering & Co.
David Heikkinen – Tudor Pickering & Co: Just a quick question on IPLA, where are you expecting costs to go, just talking about the 16 days and the number of stages?
John A. Crum: Yes, we're really feeling pretty good about what the two teams have been able to do with our drilling efforts. Obviously that, getting less days out there will pull your cost down pretty quickly. I will say, though, just to make sure I'm kind of covering this, we tend to turn around and add another frac job every time we save a little money on the drilling side, so in the end we feel pretty comfortable that we're still in this $9 million to $10 million completed and tied in Canadian dollars for a well. But as we're able to continue to drop those costs, then you've got to make then the decision should you add another frac job to the horizontal or should you go ahead and save the money and go to the next well?
David Heikkinen – Tudor Pickering & Co: On the capacity side, I guess about the hedging volumes or hedging equating to volume. Can you remind us just the pipeline and plant capacity that you have committed or tied up?
John A. Crum: Yes, so what we have is a pipeline that will handle about 700 million feet a day coming out of the Horn River Basin. Now several other of the industry partners are part of that as well. Apache's portion of that is a 30% ownership, so that would certainly make in this first stage it would be over 200 million of capacity down that line. We have an additional probably 50 million capacity down through our old Missile plant arrangements. What we tried to do here is we tried to tie this to some commitments we made to Spectra for processing and then to TCPL as they bring in a new transport line that will take gas to the east. Those are all set to come in sort of 2012.
David Heikkinen – Tudor Pickering & Co: And then on the Gulf of Mexico, looking at Geauxpher volumes, can you talk some about how that ramp in production has occurred and kind of some of the competitive drainage and what the current rates are? How are you thinking about the project right now?
John A. Crum: Well, obviously we're quite pleased with Geauxpher itself and we find ourselves in a pretty good shape on competitive drainage situation because we've got a little better capacity coming out of there then the offset players. But that said, I guess you've got to see where this is going, obviously, when you're making $105 million a day you can drain a lot of gas pretty quickly. It will decline at some point. 
David Heikkinen – Tudor Pickering & Co: Are there additional fault blocks or additional opportunities to drill the Geauxpher or how do you think about testing around there. 
John A. Crum: Yes, there is. The issue for us is our interest is lower in the offset so we're not in a real rush to do something right now. 
David Heikkinen – Tudor Pickering & Co: On the exploration side, just remind jus what you have going in the Gulf of Mexico. I know Arden was drilling, any other exploration that we ought to be thinking about. 
John A. Crum: Arden was drilling and it has resulted in a dry hole. We have no other rank exploration going on at this time. We continue to run a couple of the platform rigs working our kind of traditional areas. 
David Heikkinen – Tudor Pickering & Co: Thinking through Gulf of Mexico a lot of smaller parties have insurance issues and rig availability issues as you go into hurricane season. Can you remind us do you have business interruption insurance or do you have any insurance, Roger or John, as we get into hurricane season? 
Roger B. Plank: We have business interruption but not in the Gulf of Mexico this year. 
David Heikkinen – Tudor Pickering & Co: It was too expensive? 
Roger B. Plank: It got way too expensive. We have physical damage insurance through Oil Insurance Limited in Bermuda as a mutual, and that's up to $250 million in coverage above the deductible. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets.
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: I was wondering if there was any update on the Eagle Ford Shale if you guys have done anything there recently, picked up any acreage or drilled any new wells. 
G. Steven Farris: Well, we have a pretty good acreage position in there presently we have about 450,000 acres through the oil side and some in the gas side. In fact, we're re-looking that. We're not drilling a well at the present time. We're re-looking pressures and core analysis to try to figure out we drilled a horizontal well that was a very marginal well, frankly, on the gas side. 
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: Jumping over to the North Sea, your latest development well was obviously one of the advanced to ever drill over there at 10,500 barrels a day. Is there any difference that you guys need with that well and if you kind of consistently had better success recently apart from that [inaudible]. 
John A. Crum: We've picked a number of these targets inventory that Steve referenced earlier based on the continuing valuation of the 4D seismic that we run out there, in which case we look for potential unswept areas for the long-term water flooding activity in the field, and the 4D63 Charlie 63 well was no exception.  In fact, it was using 34 meters of [hasting], which was even larger than our pre-drill expectation. You can't see everything on the seismic and even you have to detail the geology as best you can between the wells and the seismic information. So it was a very pleasant surprise we have really a large inventory and we hope to be able to find a similar opportunity like this and then match the 77 wells that are yet to be drilled. 
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: A follow-up question here on the Horn River, [Hadean] gas bonds were up pretty nicely sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter. Did you guys get contribution from the Horn River there or was that just your regular way of winter drilling program. 
John A. Crum: That was pretty much our winter drilling program. Obviously, we put some of those wells from the '08 program on late last year. These volumes we just got we really just got those on production in July. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joseph Allman – JP Morgan.
Joseph Allman – JP Morgan: On the Horn River Basin play the shale, when you talk about 10 Bcf or more per well, are you talking about in a specific area or do you really think across your acreage position you could average 10 or more Bcf per well? 
John A. Crum: We have a pretty extensive acreage position there with our partner in Canada we've got well over 400,000 acres, so I guess I will temper that with saying we feel pretty good about that number in the Two Island Lake area. So we've drilled a lot of wells across the acreage and really have had some fairly consistent results. So feeling pretty good about it overall, but I think I have to tell you that in the Two Island Lake area we're pretty confident in these numbers. 
Joseph Allman – JP Morgan: So the 28 or so wells that you've drilled in the I think 10 that you've got producing, all of those are in the Two Island Lake area? 
John A. Crum: No, three of those are in what we would have called the Dilly area up to the northeast, and it is true that up in that are you would expect that the shale's are slightly thinner but not much thinner. In the Two Island Lake area we are concentrating our activity there primarily to feed infrastructure and reduce our overall costs. So we're basically working in the same area together to keep our costs down. 
Joseph Allman – JP Morgan: And the Two Island Lake area, what kind of acreage position is specified to that area? 
John A. Crum: Well, I think you've seen the maps that we've got out on that, but that's kind of right in the heart of our acreage. I mean we've got acreage south of there and north of there it's the biggest chunk of that 400,000 acres would be in this general. 
Joseph Allman – JP Morgan: So in that area have you tested the four corners of that area pretty much? 
John A. Crum: We have got tests pretty much in the four corners – I don't know about the four corner of it but we've tested across all of our acreage position and feel like we've got pretty consistent shale thicknesses and in fact have gas rates out a significant portion of the area. We haven't drilled horizontal wells in all those places. 
Joseph Allman – JP Morgan: In terms of the decline curve, could you describe what the decline curve is looking like for your most mature wells? 
John A. Crum: I think that's what's giving us a lot more confidence. The wells we drilled last year as we started putting more and more fracs on them we're finding that yes these decline like many shale's very quickly, but we appear to be flattening out a little quicker than what we were traditionally basing our estimations on.  So to give you a sense for that, I think I've told you in the past about the 10 frac well that I guess came on production in September of last year. That well is still making 4.5 million a day after write-out a year. So that kind of makes us feel pretty good about where these numbers can flatten out to.  The fracs we're doing this year, one of the wells we've got on has 12 fracs, the other two have 14 and that's going to be a number we'll probably stick to some where in that range and probably do a little experimenting with even higher numbers. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Tameron –Wachovia.
David Tameron –Wachovia: You guys talked a little bit about Granite Wash, can you go into more detail on the acreage position and what you've seen from the wells who have participated in, etc? 
John A. Crum: We have participated in another horizontal well and had reasonable results out of that. We have acreage in and around a number of these successful plays that are underway right now. The number I gave you of around 200,000 acres to give you it straight on how we've pulled that up we hold a huge acreage position in the Anadarko basin, more than 500,000 acres so it depends on where this play goes ultimately.  But what we did is kind of draw a circle around the area where we've seen successful horizontal tests so far and then counted up the acreage we had within that circle. So that's where we came up with around 200,000 acres in the current active play of the Granite Wash.  I think the other piece is the guys are continuing to look given our acreage position as horizontal drilling crews at some of these type plays work better and better and we continue to look at other things. And we've got a number of similar style plays that we're looking at horizontal plays in, as well, both oil and gas. 
David Tameron –Wachovia: I would assume most of this is HBP, but do you have the rights all the way down through like Atoka and more along on your acreage. 
G. Steven Farris: In most cases that's exactly the case, and so a lot of these wells we've drilled over the last five years we would have been going after Atoka or Granite Wash targets, so we've got a lot of information in the area that's why we feel quite confident about it.  And as Steve point out, this is all HBP acreage. We're not in a big rush, especially given the prices, there's no reason to run out there. So we're going to try to learn a little bit from the industry as we go and then go out and make the right calls. 
David Tameron –Wachovia: Do you care to give us your gut on where this [breaks] in, how far, how wide?
G. Steven Farris: It's a big area, I don't have a map in front of me but we're figuring we've got 250 sections in the play and we certainly don't have all the land.
David Tameron –Wachovia: Let me jump to something else, can you tell me how many rigs you have running on the natural gas side in the U.S. right now? And you might have mentioned that number, I might have missed it.
G. Steven Farris: Our crystal ball on what's going to happen to natural gas prices, is that the question?
David Tameron –Wachovia:  No, how many rigs do you have running today in the natural gas?
G. Steven Farris: We've got probably eight, nine. Nine in the U.S. and a couple in Canada, John?
John A. Crum: Up to four.
G. Steven Farris: Four, so we've got 13 rigs running.
David Tameron –Wachovia: On full year CapEx outlook, obviously depending on prices but if prices stay where they're at today, are you guys still tracking to the 3738 number and that kind of prorate the first half obviously but seeing where prices are at today, where do you think you'll come out on CapEx side?
G. Steven Farris: I think we'll be in that range. I mean, number one, I don't think we've seen costs come down as much as they're going to come down. Number two, we have a very good year going and we might gear up a little bit at the end of the year to start 2010, but right now we're staying with where we are.
David Tameron –Wachovia: The additional CapEx dollar right now, where would that go in your portfolio?
G. Steven Farris: It would be oil anywhere around the world, frankly.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Gardner – Simmons & Company.
Thomas Gardner - Simmons & Company: Just a couple of follow-up questions on the Ootla just based on your previous comments, it sounds like you feel you've, at least from a reservoir standpoint have de-risked most of your acreage there. And can you comment on your development spacing and what that might be in the play?
John A. Crum: Yes, obviously we're continuing to experiment with that to some extent and getting a couple of complete pad developments done will be a key indicator on this. Right now just if you average this out, it'd run to the five wells per what we call drilling spacing unit in Canada, which is slightly bigger than a section. And then obviously the number of fracs you put on it would kind of give you an indication of spacing if you book 14 fracs on that that kind of puts your spacing if you put it in vertical sense and more like ten acres. So that's where you get in to some pretty big numbers on this. We do feel pretty good about the acreage overall because we're seeing similar results from similar size drag jobs across the acreage. Now obviously there's still a lot of work to be done up there when you have a 2 million acre basin, but we're feeling pretty good about the resource itself, it's a matter of getting the economics right. 
Thomas Gardner - Simmons & Company:  Can you speak to the royalty and tax situation for the Ootla there in Northeast British Columbia?
John A. Crum:  Yes, British Columbia has been pretty forward thinking on trying to get some of these new developments off the table and they've got a royalty structure, which granted we're still working our way through. But it really is around trying to develop the resource and then the province will take more like a net profits interest if you will.  So what they do is they take a royalty or a net profits interest, whichever is greater. What we like about that is it allows you to go ahead and make some investments and then if they turn out pretty well, the province obviously gets a bigger interest. If they don't turn out well at all then we don't get penalized so tough. That's the real difference between the way they've done it and the way Alberta set their up.
Thomas Gardner - Simmons & Company:  Last question just jumping to M&A and the North Sea, given that the majors probably no longer consider this province in the area of growth, do you view them as perhaps strategically exiting that and is this an area that you may feel fits the Apache profile going forward for an acquisition?
G. Steven Farris:  Well, I think sooner or later that if you look at who has the big fields and at least the U.K. North Sea, its BP, Shell and Exxon. And do I think they'll focus on that in the long term? No I don't, although if you look at what the contribution of the North Sea still is to each one of those companies, it's pretty large. And the one thing that I would say is all North Sea fields aren't created equal.  And I think we've seen that from 2005 forward and a number of people have gone out there, especially a lot of little guys have gone out there and tried to make a play out of it and it's much more high cost and much more intense from a technology standpoint. And actually even we realized back in 2003 but I think we have definitely got out some of the learning curve and it would be an area that we would focus on if the right opportunity came along.
Operator: There appear to be no further questions at this time. I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Tom Chambers: Thanks everybody for joining. I just wanted to mention that Steve Farris, our CEO Chairman is going to be CNBC at 3:30 Eastern Time 2:30 Central Time, so you might want to catch him there. And for those of you with any additional questions, I'll be in my office after this call. Thanks for joining us.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2009 Q1  (2009-04-30 14:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Apache Corporation First Quarter 2009 Earning Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at this time for opening remarks I would like to turn the call over to Tom Chambers Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.
Tom Chambers: Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us today for Apache Corporation's first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. As you have probably seen this morning we reported first quarter net loss of $1.76 billion or $5.25 per diluted share.  Loss was the result of the continuing deterioration in north American gas prices at the end of 2008 which recorded 1.98 billion non-cash after tax reduction in the carrying value of oil and gas properties as required by the booker methodology of accounting. Just to reiterate low cost accounting rules require us to calculate the 10% discounted after tax value of our proved reserves using flat period and prices and cost for the entire life of the reserve base. As the calculated discounted value is less than our net carrying value the excess monthly written-off. The reported write down is a non-cash charge and in that way it impacts our ongoing financial flexibility. Roger Plank will provide more details in his comments. Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions and no assurance can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located on our website any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or costs incurred will be identified as such as the reconciliation located on our website at www.apachecorp.com. We routinely put up important information on our website and including today's additional detail on the Permian Basin acquisition from Marathon announced this morning. On today's call we will have four speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. We will open up with Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer followed Rod Eichler our Co-Chief Operating Officer and President International, John Crum our Co-Chief Operating Officer and President North America and concluding by Roger Plank our President and with that I’ll turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Farris: Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining our first quarter 2009 earnings call. Before I get into the first quarter remarks I would like to take moment and outline the format of today's call because we do have more speakers. Tom Chambers as you heard is our Vice President of Investor Relations. Rod Eichler and John Crum are our new Co-Chief Operating Officers and they will review the operating highlights and then Roger Plank who is Apache's new President will review the financial highlights for the quarter.  One final side notes I would like to mention I would like to publicly thank Bob Dye who has done an outstanding job over a decade in directing Apache's Investor Relations. Tom Chambers is taking over and Bob is taking a broader administrative role within Apache.  All of you saw today we announced the acquisition of the Permian oil portfolio in the Permian Basin from Marathon Oil in the Permian Basin. These long lived oil properties are a great fit for our large portfolio in the Permian and will provide us with drilling inventories for many years. I think we communicated over recent months that we are starting to see better value opportunities and this transaction is representative of that view. In the first quarter Apache's global production increased by 6% over the previous quarter which is in line with the expectations for the year. And as Rod and John will review in greater detail in a moment we had another quarter of important oil discoveries, a diverse range of basins in place. We discovered new fields in Egypt, five new fields in Egypt including three with a combined 9400 barrels of oil per day. In Australia we proved a new gas horizon in multi-Tcf (inaudible) complex. In Argentina we discovered a new field in Tierra del Fuego and we also made an important oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico. As the entire world faces challenging times our focus is on long-term growth in our financial discipline remains unchanged. Over our 54 year history Apache's disciplined values and controlling spirit have enabled the company not only to live through down cycles but to emerge even stronger. And we are taking on that task once again. We are trying to take difficult steps as they are required. Last week we announced a painful but necessary 6% reduction on our worldwide headcount. Living within once cash flow has become a sacred mantra during the recent months. And Apache was ahead of this new conventional wisdom and continued to maintain our discipline. Importantly our portfolio allows to live within our annual cash flow at today's oil and gas prices. It is very different from living now from hedging programs and hoping for massive price rebounds over the coming months. Our view is that Apache should be able to create value consistently across price scenarios. And today is no exception. The oil and gas sector operated for many years at prices below those we experience now and have done so profitably. We believe that current downturn should serve as a reminder of the imperative need for portfolio balance and focus on efficiency in our sector. Apache has long stood out in both of these areas and often times been penalized in the market as a result. We are hopeful that the benefits of Apache's long-term strategy will be more widely recognized and more favorably accepted in the current environment. Although we are maintaining our 2009 production growth target of 6% to 14%. We expect to come in at the lower end of that range. You take into account our lower capital spending and recently the contractors delay at Van Gogh development an offshore Western Australia. If there is a silver lining in the Van Gogh delay is that we now expect those barrels to come on around the end of the year 2009 which should help our oil growth in 2010. For the second quarter of 2009 we are anticipating a 3% to 5% production increase from the first quarter volumes. And with that I think I will turn it over to Rod and John and Roger and then we will go to Q&A.
Rod Eichler: Thank you, Steve. I will provide a quick overview of main developments in international regions. Beginning in Egypt net production was 136,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 10.9% increase from fourth quarter. The region achieved new daily production records for gross oil and condensate at 161,739 barrels of fluid per day and gross gas at 685 million cubic feet gas per day. On the exploration side we completed drilling and or testing operations on 9 new [wildcat] wells resulting in five new field discoveries during the first quarter. Apache has 100% contract of working interest in all of these wells. Some brief highlights on three of these new discoveries in the greater Khalda Concession area are as follows. The Phiops-1X well on Kalabsha Development Lease logged 173 feet of oil pay in the Cretaceous AEB sands and 103 feet pay in the Jurassic Safa sands. Safa sands tested at 2300 barrels of oil per day and 5.2 million cubic feet of gas per day and production commenced on April 16. Additionally two development wells are presently drilling to exploit the AEB and Safa pay season discovery well. The WKAL-C-1X was Kalabsha Concession logged 202 net feet of oil pay in the AEB sands and 17 feet of Jurassic Safa sand pay, test rates were 2900 barrels of condensate per day and 15.8 million cubic feet of gas per day in the AEB. And 770 barrels of oil per day and 3.9 million cubic feet of gas per day in the Safa. First production from the well should be in the third quarter. The WKAL-C-1X in the north concession logged 48 feet of AEB sand pay and tested 3500 barrels of oil per day and 4.5 million cubic feet gas per day. This is the first commercial oil discovery in this concession and first production is expected in the fourth quarter. The remaining two field discoveries will be tested over the next few weeks separately we are currently drilling two new Jurassic wildcat wells at Falcon and Chassis.  On the development side I would like to note that commissioning and start up of this gas plant trains three and four and Northern Pipeline Compression projects is progressing. Upon completion around June 1 and for the balance of the year we expect gross gas production from the concessions to average 730 million cubic feet gas per day, a 34% increase from the 540 million cubic feet of gas per day at the beginning of the first quarter. I should note that just before this call we learned that the Northern Gas Compression project has been fully activated and is in operation. In Australia, net production was 31,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 13.7% increase over fourth quarter. On the exploration side we drilled two wells in the multi-Tcf Julimar and Brunello complex. [Broken Wood] one was drilled to investigate two previously untested channel sands on the formation. The well encountered 21.8 meter of net gas pay in the. Broken Wood two found 11 meters of net gas pay in the G.30 sands. These two wells together confirmed the presence of a significant gas resource in this prolific area. In March, Apache together with impacts completed the purchase of BHP equity in two undeveloped oil fields in the sub basin. Apache's interest increased from 31.5% to 45.7% in the undeveloped [Kanister and Nuvara] fields. Apache will operate and subject to successful appraisal these fields may be developed utilizing nearby Van Gogh FPSO.  Turning to development of facilities project we had a very busy quarter in Australia. The Devil Creek development project for the Reindeer fields launched with the signing of the CP mining gas sales agreement in January. Work has commenced on the onshore gas plant under contract issue to do inclusive projects Australia. Offshore construction contracts will be issued by the third quarter and we anticipate first production in 2011. The Marina's Islands repair program is nearing completion. We have consistently produced 273 million cubic feet gas per day off the island since the beginning of March and we expect to raise the overall deliverability to 382 million cubic feet gas per day by the first week of June, significantly exceeding the pre-incident rate of 390 million cubic feet gas per day. As we announced April 14, Prosafe, the developer of the FPSO we have leased to service our Van Gogh oil project informed us they have had a fire incident in the control rooms on the vessel. The investigation teams have completed their on board inspections and site clean up has commenced. The cause of the fire is yet unknown. Prosafe is pushing vendors for accelerated delivery times on replacement equipment. Based on information available to date we estimate first production at Van Gogh around year end. In the North Sea net production averaged 60,900 barrels of oil per day a decrease of 2% from the fourth quarter, due to vessel overhauls and unplanned pipeline repairs. Before repair downtime however production was up a net 1800 barrels of oil per day. On the drilling side we completed four successful oil development wells during the quarter which are currently producing 8500 barrels of oil per day, of note is the 4-5 well which accounted 26-meters of pay and is producing 5,000 barrels of oil per day water free. We are currently completed additional two successful development wells and will be on production in May. Production efficiency of the Fortis field was 90% during the quarter a 31% field wide gain since our acquisition in 2003. As of today the field is operated a record 224 days without a seas export interruption in production. Starting May 2 Delta platform which makes 16,000 barrels of oil per day shut down for a planned 16 day plant turn around. Turning to Argentina, net product was 47,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 4% down from fourth quarter. But without any decline in hydrocarbon liquids product. In the Neuquén province Apache finalized extension of eight federal development blocks representing 590,000 acres for ten additional years. These leases presently produce 7,000 barrels of liquids per day and 100 million cubic feet of gas per day. With this move we extend the producing acreage base from 2,016 to 2,027. Apache paid a bonus of $23 million, increased the provincial loyalty rate from 12% to 15% and committed to do a $320 million work program over the next 19 years. Also in the Neuquén province there was continued success in the drilling of nine wells in the deep gas fields at Ranquil Co and Guanaco. These fields these wells tested between 3 million and 7 million cubic feet of gas per day. Apache also had a new oil base in position to its portfolio with awarding of the crucial CCyB 17 B block in the Mendoza province. New block consists of just over 1 million sparsely drilled non-producing net acres which surround 22 of the largest oil fields in Argentina. Apache's acreage is immediately adjacent to and on trend with several fields but has never been explored with 3-D seismic. Apache plans two significant 3D surveys once permitting is completed in mid 2010.  Lastly in Tierra del Fuego Austral basin Apache made a new field discovery with the (inaudible) 2001 which tested at 2.4 million cubic feet of gas per day and 300 barrels of oil per day. We structured approximately 2 kilometers in size and two development tests are plan. This discovery is significant because the structure is a look alike to several others in the immediate area which were identified using Apache's 2500 square kilometer 3D seismic survey acquired in 2008. That wraps up the international. I'd like to now turn over the presentation of John Crum who will discuss our activities in North American operations. 
John Crum: Thank you, Rod. In Canada net production was 78,000 barrels equivalent, an increase of 2% from the fourth quarter 2008, primarily on successful winter drilling program adds. As an update on the Ootla river basin which many of you heard about? You are aware that both Apache and our partner in Canada are drilling in the two like area with pad style development programs. This minimizes our infrastructure costs and reduces our footprint while testing the full development model pad operation. The partners have almost completed a shared dehydration compression facility for the area and a 41-mile, 24-inch export line to the spectra tie in point at Cabin Lake is being commissioned as we speak. EnCana has already drilled and cased eight horizontal wells and will drill three additional wells this year. Two of the EnCana operated wells are already completed with remainder expected by late summer. We expect to see first sales from the EnCana wells by July. On the Apache operated D70-K pad we have two rigs in place both the moving systems drilling on the same pad. We've patched that surface casing on all 16 wells planned for the pad. The first two horizontal wells have been drilled and cased with approximately 5,000 foot laterals. We will drill all 16 wells before mobilizing the frac spread to control our costs. We presently expect to start frac operations by September and have this pad producing the sales by the ends of the year. We will be increasing the number of fracs per well in the program this year based on the success of last year's program where our 10 frac well, the most we did in any of those wells last year is still producing over 4 million a day after seven months on production. In the central region net production was 89,600 barrels equivalent per day. That's down 3% from the last quarter of 2008 as we severely curtailed drilling due to the price realizations. This morning though we announced that Apache is acquiring Permian Basin properties from Marathon as Steve discussed for $190 million. These properties are located in nine fields in West Texas and eastern New Mexico and currently produce 1850 barrels of oil and NGLs and 10 million feet of gas. The properties are a great fit for our large Permian position as most of significant part directly offsets our units operations where we have a substantial operating base. That area has been the foundation for our Permian drilling programs for over a decade. Needless to say we know this area very well. We've already identified 200 possible drilling locations. For example, as a general rule throughout the area we have drilled these properties down to 20 acres profitably. The properties we are acquiring are remaining at 40-acre spacing. So we expect some good infill programs out of this. Elsewhere in the central region we drilled and completed our moody's seven H, and Bossier horizontal well in Freestone County, Texas, It tested at 15 million feet a day in February and is still, and is now producing the sales of over 7 million feet a day as of last week.  The well is 100 percent working interest and they have a number of other prospects in the area. We were also quite pleased to announce that Apache has begun operating its first compressed natural gas refueling station at Elk City, Oklahoma; enabling the Company to fuel 40 field vehicles with cleaner-burning natural gas produced from the company's wells in the Anadarko basin.  We had to install conversion kits in these trucks since domestic pick up manufacturers do not presently produced CNG vehicles. We are hopeful that the success of this project will encourage production of such vehicles in the future leading to both cleaner air and lower costs. In the Gulf Coast region net production was 104,100 barrels equivalent per day. That's an increase of 20% from the fourth quarter of last year as we continued to recover from our hurricane outages. A significant exploration success this last quarter was Ewing Banks 998, number one, discovery which tested at 4254 barrels of oil a day with 5.4 million feet of gas. The well will be connected to existing facilities using a subsea tie-back with first production expected during the first quarter of 2010.  On the development side we've been telling you about [gopher] that discovery is expected to come on during May and we would expect to ramp up production to a net roughly 45 million feet per day by July.  To update you little more on the hurricane recovery at the end of the quarter we were still down 63 million cubic feet per day on our gas production and some 4250 barrels per day on our oil production. All of that primarily due to third party pipeline outages, that has just taken longer to recover from.  By the ends of the second quarter we would expect those figures to be down to 35 million cubic feet of gas per day and 3,000 barrels of oil. And we expect to have all of this essential back on by September.  Across North America we've been working within our capital discipline for the year and our teams have been focused on building their prospects inventory on our large acreage position. In the current market we enjoy the benefit that our acreage position is mostly held by production. We will have a substantial ready to drill inventory as soon as we see some product price help. Finally I know there's a lot of interest on costs so I'd like to give you a little color on cost levels. We are starting to see strong cost reduction movement. Here are some examples. In Canada, we've recently gone to bid for the fracs for our (inaudible) program. It looks like it will be down 40% for an equal size job from last year. Some of this reduction I will say has to do with the way we are doing the job with the efficiency gains on multi-well pad operations but the rest will be service and commodity pricing reductions.  Rig rates are down as well in Canada but we have got most of our drilling program done for the year. In the Gulf of Mexico published rates are down 50% from their peak last fall. A 350-foot IC is not, probably just 70,000 a day down from 150,000 per day last October. Net rigs are down to 45,000 per day from 85,000 per day last year.  Boats are running 30% down from last year. In the Anadarko basin rigs are being quoted at 12,500 per day down from 20,000 last year. In the Permian Basin we are seeing 8600 versus 13.6 last year, net in costs are down 30% and stimulation is 35 to 40%. Overall we can now drill and complete a well in western Oklahoma for at least 30% less than last year. With that I will turnover this discussion to Roger. 
Roger Plank:  Okay. Thank you, John. And good afternoon everyone. In Cairo we drink a beer called Stella its not Stella Artois, but Stella local. It's rather murky in appearance, perhaps to hide the occasional chunk, that are found floating in it. But Stella has a great motto on their T-shirts "That which does not kill us makes us stronger". That's not a bad statement about Apache and what's happening in our industry today.  Collapsing prices, particularly for North American natural gas are straining producers some to the snapping point. And while Apache with our $2 billion write-down it's hardly un-staged this is not our first downturn by any means. And our finance wherewithal remains intact. We intend to be among the few that come out, the other ends of this downturn stronger for it. As Steve mentioned we are taking the tough steps as we endeavor to lead today's change rather than fall victim to it. We are raining in capital spending to preserve our financial flexibility and A rating. This gives us a tremendous competitive advantage in today's world of limited access to capital. Five-year money for Apache today costs under 5%. In the first quarter we reduced capital over half a billion dollars from the prior quarter alone and kept exploration and development spending in line with our plan. Our investment in cash flow have different profiles through the year but all in 2009 projected E&D capital of $3.5 billion to $4 billion is anticipated to fall well within cash flow.  We are also battling costs that are returned, both cash and non-cash which I will go into shortly. Our personnel reductions have been painful but they've also been necessary to write size the organization for today's much lower commodity price environment.  The annualized savings of $21 million gross will become more apparent after getting beyond the one time, $10 million severance charge that we expect in the second quarter. As an aside I'd noted that the four members of the office of the CEO have also cut their salaries by 10%. DD&A costs are also coming down aside benefit of write downs that lessens our future amortization rate.  And finally because we have over $1 billion in cash and short term investments and a manageable debt to cap rate, in the mid 20% range, we are one of few positioned to take advantage of today's adversity. The Marathon deal that John mentioned is good example. At prices that we hedged averaging $57 a barrel and $5.70 per MMBtu, our acquisition economics indicate we are buying these long lived legacy properties for just under 4.5 times cash flow.  Using last year's 2008 average prices these same properties would easily have fetched in purchase price around a half a billion dollars. While at $187 million this is a relatively smaller deal, these properties are modestly accretive to earnings and cash flow immediately. And they add 26 million barrels of equivalent reserves at just $7.21 per BOE.  We plan to remain very discriminating as we assist through additional purchase opportunities but clearly the flood gate has opened. Now to specifics on the quarter. In comparing the first to the fourth quarter we've removed write-downs, foreign exchange impacts on deferred tax and other tax adjustments in an effort to capture the normalized, quote normalized earnings of the company.  Accordingly, we earned an adjusted $218 million or $0.65 per share in the first quarter versus $276 million or $0.82 per share in the fourth quarter. Despite oil and gas realization is dropping 16% and 19% respectively. Cash flow from operations declined 10% to $983 million driven by a 17% decline in realization but countered by a 6% increase in production and significant cost reductions.  Lease operating expenses for example totaled $8.06 per BOE and that was down 26% from the $10.91 reported in the fourth quarter. The decrease includes lower hurricane repairs and insurance costs and lower power fuel and other costs. Absent one off effects the LOE rate per BOE should fall in a range of around $8 in quarter still well below the 10.91 reported in the fourth quarter. Whole cost DD&A of $10.86 per BOE was down 17% from the fourth quarter and should drop another 5% or so following the first quarter write-down.  The write-down by the way only affected North American properties and was driven by lower natural gas prices. General and administrative costs per BOE of $1.72 were up 17% on several one time items. [Absent] non-recurring item the unit costs would have dropped to around $1.35 per BOE which is an achievable run rate going forward. Our effective income tax rate was temporarily reduced to 28% by the write downs from our normalized run rate of 38% to 40%. Clearly the first quarter was a tough one. The decline in our average realized price totaled $6.87 per BOE. On the bright side however we are able extract $3.60 per BOE out of cash costs in order to preserve at $19.70 per BOE cash margin and while this stay off next to last year's average margin it's still very robust relative to most of our 50 plus years.  Given our progress in reducing costs and increasing production and with $4 billion of financial capacity this downturn will almost certainly make us stronger. With that I think this five man parade is over and we would be happy to address any questions. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instruction]. We will go first to Tom Gardner with Simmons & Company. 
Tom Gardner - Simmons & Company : Good afternoon, gentlemen. I just wanted to do ask a question concerning your each Egyptian discoveries. Specifically can you give us a ballpark estimate of the added resource potential associated with the three oil discoveries? 
Steve Farris:  Its, if you look at the first couple of wells we have, some of these are early stage development. The fee option is perhaps our one of our most exciting projects that we have in 2009, exploration side we made this discovery early in the quarter. We anticipate drilling at least five wells in the future in 2009 and our expectation is to be able to exploit that AEB very large oil of the AEB oil column to achieve perhaps a field wide rate production rate of 10,000 barrels per day. Exact reserve size it remains to be determined based on the success of the appraisal and exploration drilling towards this process of doing right now. Let's go to off shore this is the third such well in an area in our Faghur Basin play which we had discovered last year 2008. We are very excited about the rates we established in the first well. This structure is typically, support sizes up to about 2 million barrels to 3 million barrels. However once again as development drilling needs to be done on this prospect as well. And North Sea is the first discovery in the concession to great attractive structural accumulation. We also review the development drilling there. And we won't be able to test a well in full production until we have a development lease from a government which will come some time in the next 45 to 90 days. 
Tom Gardner - Simmons & Company : Thanks for that. And jumping over to Argentina, I just wanted to know how much the concession extension may have impacted your plans in the region and to what degree capital is still restricted and are you expecting gas prices to go up in the region going forward? 
Steve Farris:  The concession extension is very important to our program because it has specially, doubled the existing life of the concession area. It protected our production and allowed us to add that the tale of the reserves otherwise it would have been granted back to the province beginning in 2016. That is essentially having 9 million barrels net to us by the fact of signing the extensions. It's a significant area. It's our bread and butter area in Argentina at the present time. And so the extension gives us a lot of life and running room for our program in the future. With regard to the drilling program our drilling program in Argentina is pretty heavily loaded on the front end of the year. And I don't see much activity because we have curtailed Capex in Argentina accordingly associated with the cost primarily correct market prices as well as costs of doing business at the correct time. 
John Crum:  On the gas price side you might have noticed that year-over-year we were up $0.14 to $1.98. I think that's the highest price we've had since we've been there. And they still have severe shortages there and basically when we, we can propose drilling new areas and get an exemption if you will from delivering that gas into low priced markets and selling it into free markets. And so the more that, more new gas we bring on the higher we hope to see our average price go. 
Tom Gardner - Simmons & Company:  Thank you, gentlemen, that's helpful. 
Operator:
 : We will go next, David Heikkinen with Tudor Pickering Holt.
David Heikkinen- Tudor Pickering Holt: Good afternoon guys. A question about your thoughts around the E&D market now with your first acquisition announced, how many do you think are out there similar size kind of your target range, or what will be the maximum and just trying to get a feel for what you are thinking now that, now that you started maybe buying some things. 
Rod Eichler:  Well, I don't think it's any secret that we are for the first time in two or three years actively looking for good things to buy. I think Roger pointed out that difference in price scenarios from last year to this year and putting reserves on your book at $7.21 rather than close to $20 per barrel is much more palatable to us. I think in terms of number one, we don't have anything in front of us. But we constantly are looking and I would tell you I think the bid and the ask between the buyer and the seller is getting a lot closer. I truly anticipate by this summer a lot of thing will start turning over. Obviously we are looking for thing to fit us like this Permian so we don't chase every pretty girl but I'm very confident that this year it's going to be a good year.  
David Heikkinen- Tudor Pickering Holt: Do you have any thoughts about volumes that you would buy or any ranges or is that just, that you talked in the past, acquisitions come and sometimes you get them and when they happen they happen? 
Steve Farris: Well, I think if you think about the time frame it's probably a pretty good time to grow. And you can either grow drilling wells or you can grow buying things and now as costs starts coming down it gets a little more economic to drill but in terms of the economics of acquisitions right now it's probably a better time to acquire. So I'm not going to put a size on it but, and we are a, we like to grow incrementally. So I doubt very seriously if you could see us go up and buy something gigantic but in terms of buying something little bigger than what you saw there we would probably do that also. 
David Heikkinen- Tudor Pickering Holt: Okay thanks. That's helpful.
Operator:  We will go next, Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs. 
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Following up on the last question but more towards your comments on drilling, with costs having come down I mean I appreciate the color on that, what gas price do you think it would make sense to begin drilling again in the US onshore and the US offshore and how does that I guess, how does that work in with your acquisition capital or planned acquisition capital as well. Does that further then need to get higher gas price to say it's not necessarily worth doing acquisitions, let's start drilling again?  
Steve Farris: I think that the first point here is that we don't think cost have come down as far as they are going to come down yet. So it's a question of when do, you want a dollar cash cost average down or you want to wait until they get down there. And I think to the extent that we can we are going to push the service companies as far down as we can get them. And in terms of what price you needed it really depends on where it is. I mean it's very hard to make a blanket statement that you need $5 gas or you need $4 gas because every prospect honestly has a different profile and a different cost. So that's a, if anybody gives you a number unless they are just drilling a lot of wells in one area it's pretty hard to come up with that number.  
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs: What about the Western Oklahoma specifically or Oklahoma specifically which I know is an area it's been very active I mean it's an area where we've seen the rig count come down significantly? 
Steve Farris:  John you want to?
John Crum : No I think a lot of what you saw happening in Oklahoma is not only cost getting out of line but our basis differential got completely screwy there for a while. Those are starting to level out. And so we weren't even seeing, what would be anywhere close to an acceptable price in Western Oklahoma in the first quarter. Obviously these costs coming down will help but I just talked to our drilling manager up there a few hours before this call and he is seeing even more reductions coming. So for Steve's points I think we will just kind of watch this little bit longer and see where it's going.  
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs:  Great, thanks. Can I ask one more, can you give us an update on the Western Australia gas market both on how your main industrial customers are the main industrial consumers are fairing in the current environment and where you see pricing on the margin? 
Steve Farris:
 : Well, I think that there is no doubt that you would be; the supply of gas is just not in the United States. There was a demand weakens in the United States, demand has weakened around the world. We were able to sign a very good contract with CP mining. That's going to underpin the development of the Reindeer field. But in terms of our current outlook it's probably more in the $4 to $6 range rather than $6 to $8 range. 
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you. 
Operator:  We will go next to Gil Yang with Citigroup. 
Gil Yang - Citigroup: Good afternoon. Going back to the M&A market, just for a second, Steve, you mentioned that you would like to grow incrementally. Would that seem to, just that you would not use the current low price environment to step into new areas that you would like to be in that you are not currently in?  
Steve Farris: You know, the problem, never say never. It's probably a much better time to know what you are doing and do it in areas that you have people that know what they are doing.
Gil Yang - Citigroup: Okay.
Steve Farris:
 : But with the right opportunity came along in an area that we wanted to be in that wouldn't be out of the question. 
Gil Yang – Citigroup: Right. That's helpful. Second question I have got just about the acquisition. Could you just comment on what, how big you expect the well to be on a 20 acres versus the 40 acres spacing that they are currently on in terms of EUR? 
Steve Farris: Those wells will probably make 150,000 barrels a piece. So, you are looking at [me do] for example that this right offset our northeast record unit that we picked up many years ago and we had a tremendous program there, and we ramped production up significantly and still are doing parts of that extension water flooding around that field. In round numbers I think they were about 150,000. 
John Crum:  While importantly too in that area these are multi-pay areas, so we have other than the drinker available to us there. A lot of different sands and carbonates produce in that area. That's why we like it so well. 
Gil Yang – Citigroup: Okay, that's helpful. I was just trying to get a sense for how these wells, the 20 acre wells would perform versus the 40 acre wells. Would the 40 acre wells be closer to 200,000 barrels or? 
Steve Farris:  In fact we haven't seen an awful lot of interference between our 40 acre spacing. If you saw a lot of interference you wouldn't down space. It's not acceleration drilling that you are doing to down space to 20. What you are really trying to do is get oil is not going to be produced from a 40 acre spacing.
Gil Yang – Citigroup: Okay. All right. Fine. Thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Joe Allman with J.P. Morgan. 
Joe Allman - J.P. Morgan:  Thank you, everybody. In terms of the Capex budget could you clarify what the Capex budget is for '09 and what the commodity prices you are now basing that on? 
Steve Farris: Well, our Capex budget is around $3.5 billion right now, maybe a little bit higher than that, $3.6, $3.65. And that's based on $40, and $4 gas. 
John Crum:  $4.50.
Steve Farris: $4.50 gas, I'm sorry. 
Joe Allman - J.P. Morgan: Okay, that’s helpful. You mentioned Ootla I think composure shale, I think you said Freestone County. What kind of scale do you have in that area? 
John Crum:  We have got quite a bit of acreage in the area so the guys are working pretty hard on seeing where else this might apply but if you know something about chasing the Bossier it's not a blanket operation. You've got to pick the right places when you go up. 
Joe Allman - J.P. Morgan: Okay and then just a question on difference for acquisitions, is it important for Apache to be an operator in any acquisitions you do and I'm think about maybe a JV opportunity? Are you looking at some potential JV opportunities that are out there? 
Steve Farris: In terms of a drilling JV?  
Joe Allman - J.P. Morgan: Yeah, some of these JVs that are out there for the unconventional plays. 
Steve Farris: Now, again, I never say never but we are not a very cogent non operator. If we are not able to control it, it's probably not of a big interest to us. 
Joe Allman - J.P. Morgan: Got you. Thank you, very helpful. 
Operator: We will go next to Larry Benedetto with Howard Weil.  
Larry Benedetto - Howard Weil: Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. A couple of things on Julimar you mentioned that you had some further exploration success there, is there any update on your expectations, your plans as to how you might look to monetize the asset in terms of which LNG you go down? 
John Crum:  We are currently looking at a couple of different LNG options for the development of that project and it's a little bit too early in our decision making process to land on one versus another. But we are actively pursuing that.
Larry Benedetto - Howard Weil: I guess what's behind my question at some point would Apache consider taking an equity steak in one or other of the opportunities and if so any update as to how those discussions might be going? 
Rod Eichler:  Certainly a lot of different options are on the table. There was time that we’re evaluating. It's probably a little early for us to commit one way or the other or to say the direct we are looking to go at this time.
Larry Benedetto - Howard Weil: Okay. I will leave that one. Jumping to Egypt. Again it seems that every time we turn around there's substantial exploration success there but you haven't really given any update on the production outlook since your two X target set a few years ago. 11 is the original target what are your thoughts now in terms of what the potential is in Egypt and when might we get an update in terms of the longer term opportunity? What needs to happen to fit the pieces in place or for you to give us an update? 
Rod Eichler:  Well give you an idea on the two X which benefits everybody listening the two X program was the two times projection project which we launched with the government back in 2005. The objective was to be able to double our net production which was 163,000 barrels per day to double that by year end of 2010, which can take up to 326,000 barrels per day that was our target oil equivalent. Presently, at least as of last week our forecast based on our original projections was to be 260,443 barrels of oil equivalent per day as of the 19th of April. I'm pleased to report that as of 19th of April our actual production was 273,701 barrels of oil equivalent per day. So we are well ahead of the forecast with just about 18 months left to go on the program. So we are, and a big part of it of course the gas components that we have which is growing significantly as I mentioned in my remarks beginning in June of this year with the completion of the two new gas trains in Salam and northern compression project which will boost our net gas production mainly by 100 million per day and about 500,000 barrels of condensate per day. 
Larry Benedetto - Howard Weil: Not ready to give us an update yet?
Steve Farris: The other thing you have to recognize is we are just finishing putting three and four there and we will have been, again be captive until such time as we build another train out there and we have shelved the train because of cost in 2008 and we are looking to pick that up again probably in 2010, which would be another 100 million per day train. 
Larry Benedetto - Howard Weil: Okay. I will wait on the updates. Just one thing I want from the, I'm sorry if I missed this earlier in the prepared remarks but cash operating cost, what kind of guidance can you give us in terms of how sustainable or where we see the cash kept the LOE in particular go from here, I think you are (inaudible) need dollars which is a fairly healthy decline from Q4 in particular, but how much lower do you think that can go given your current new cost cutting initiatives, what is your kind of target there if you want to lay one out there for us? 
John Crum:  So, I think I’ve mentioned the quarter we were at 806 from 1091 or something. 1091 and we had some non-recurring things in it. But we still foresee a rate somewhere around eight in a quarter on a go forward basis. The longer prices stay down the more those costs have come down but at least at this point in time we see that low $8 number sustainable. 
Steve Farris:  I talked a little bit about the being able to do business in any price environment. I'm going to give you some examples of some numbers because we are going to have to see service companies get down to these levels. 2006 we averaged about $60 per barrel and about $5.60 on gas. Our operating costs were $5.40 per barrel. If you look at $8 per barrel, we've got a lot of services that still have to come out of this business to get down to those kind of numbers and do I think we will get that far down? The mix has changed but the fact of the matter that costs have got to continue to come down and they will. As long as if we continue to see these kind of prices costs will continue to come down.
Larry Benedetto - Howard Weil: Appreciate the clarity, Steve, thanks. 
Operator: We will go next to Leo Mariani with RBC. 
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets: Good afternoon you guys. Do you have any update in your activity in the Eagle Ford Shale play?  
John Crum: We are presently evaluating that. I guess we did have some drilling problems on several wells there and we’re kind of working through that to make sure we understood what the issues are. I will say we will be trending toward looking at the gas windows a little more than the oil window there, and I guess that's as much as I can tell you about it. 
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Just curious about what your other high impact exploration activity looks like in 2009, kind of outside of Egypt? I know you guys had a program out there in Australia. Just curious to see what's going on these days?  
Rod Eichler:  The primary exploration area is for internationally are Egypt and Australia. For 2009 and we have a 15 well program in Australia for 2009 that includes 12 exploration appraisal wells and three development wells which are three development wells are Van Gogh and John Brookes field. We trailed five exploration wells so far, one development well with four successes. And so we have a floated just moved into the location just this past month and we have a continual drilling campaign will take us through into the early part of the third quarter. As far as the projects go of course these key appraisal wells that I mentioned in my remarks with regard to the in the June March about Mellow complex are important expanding our confidence in the size of that resource as well as we anticipate beginning a appraisal and development program at the acquisition later this year which also has a significant reserve upside for us in 2009. 
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. You flocks talked quite a bit about reducing your onshore natural gas activity given the low price environment. Can you talk about little bit your onshore oil activity and whether or not you've seen a big reduction there and kind of what your thoughts are about drilling in a $50 type of price here? 
John Crum:  Well, one of the examples I gave you is on Permian Basin rigs and they would primarily be working on oil prospects of indeed we are seeing costs come down there as well. Obviously we would like to get back to oil drilling as early as possible but really was around getting costs completely out of line over the last year. 
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. So I guess it, are you trying to saying that you don't really have many rigs running on the oil side at all in the US it gaining for cost consumption?  
John Crum: Just to give you an example in the central region right now we have one rig running, that's running in Western Oklahoma. So, we would typically have, I don't know, maybe 35, 40 rigs running at this time of the year. 
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. 
Operator: [Operator Instruction]. We will go next to David Tameron with Wachovia.  
David Tameron - Wachovia Securities:  Hi, thanks, good afternoon, everybody. Nice quarter. A couple questions getting back to economic, when do these projects become, when do service costs drop enough to get making the projects working? If you did have to put, can you talk about just if you look at your natural gas plays what today given current service costs and current health prices has the best economics, not to say you would go out and drill today but of the once you look at in your portfolio on the natural gas which ones have the best economics? 
Steve Farris: Frankly it's the Gulf of Mexico and the reason is you don't see the declines, and we drill off the more existing platforms and so what happens there is that you get a rate for a period of time. It doesn't have the, whether it's Apache's shale play or anybody else shale play it doesn't have the hyperbolic curve to it. So, what happens is if you don't get the upfront price out of those non conventional place you have a heck of a time ever making the economic. But if I make 20 million per day for three year lap get have the same reserves out of those two. I will make much better economics drilling Gulf of Mexico well.  
David Tameron - Wachovia Securities: Okay. What's the number two right now, Steve, do you have a feel for that? 
Steve Farris: Oil.
David Tameron - Wachovia Securities: Alright, put it up. One bigger picture question on gas side. Obviously on this side of the phone everybody always tries to figure out what the right long-term natural gas price is. From your perspective, one, do you have an opinion on what that number is it, two, can service costs drop enough or is it likely that service costs drop enough that maybe the number is four or five versus a six or seven number? Can you talk a little bit about that? 
Steve Farris: This is, I've been in this business 37 years, so I will tell you that if you have $4, $5 gas price for most of my career four, $4, $5 was mechanicka. And we drilled a lot of wells. And if you have $4, $5 gas price you will have cost or conventional we have to make the right return because and I love them all, good friends of mine but drilling companies are par sites. You don't have a producer that spend money, you don't have somebody to drills the well. I'm not so concerned about is there a margin. What I'm concerned about is that the current price fit the current cost and in my knowledge still don't.
David Tameron - Wachovia Securities: They don't, but one thing I wanted to mention because this question has come up a couple of times, it's not that we have projects, we do have these two but it's not just that we have projects that aren't economic at today's price, because really our capital has been curtailed in order to preserve our financial flexibility. It's written, from my perspective the question is what do prices have to rise to before we have the cash flow to put more at it into the ground. So, if you were to ask our regions I think they would tell you, we have a lot more inventory that makes economics than the amount of capital that we are allocating to. 
Steve Farris: The one thing I would say about that and hopefully it's coming across because Roger makes a very good point and I've been trying to make, the reason that we are not drilling right now is not because you can't make economics. It is because why would I drill a well if I know, and I'm certain costs are going to keep coming down. Why would I drill a well and spend more money than I have to spend to drill the well. And we have, if you looked at our original budget coming into the year it is significantly what the regions had spots on the map for at $4.50 and $40 oil. It is significantly higher than the amount of money we are spending. What we are hoping is that those same $3.5 billion, $3.6 billion is going to drill a lot more wells because costs are going to keep coming down. 
David Tameron - Wachovia Securities: Okay. Now, that's great color. Thanks. 
Operator: And there are no other questions at this time. I would like to turn things back to our speakers for any closing remarks. 
Tom Chambers:  Thank you for joining us today. I will be in my office if anyone has any further questions. Thanks.
Operator: That concludes our questions. That concludes our conference. Thank you for your participation.

G. Steven Farris: (Operator Instructions). Welcome to the Apache Corporation third quarter and year-end earnings 2008 conference call. Today’s presentation will be hosted by Mr. Bob Dye, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Dye, please go ahead sir.
Bob Dye:  Thanks for joining us today for Apache Corporations fourth quarter and year-end 2008 earnings conference call. This morning we reported net income of $706 million or $2.09 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2008.  Reported a net loss of $2.9 billion or a negative $8.08 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2008, and the fourth quarter loss was a result of a severe drop in oil and gas commodity prices since the middle of 2008 that caused us to record a $3.65 billion non cash after tax reduction in the caring value of oil and gas properties as required by the full cost methodology of accounting. We indicated in a release earlier this year that an impairment was likely given year-end prices. For those of those of you not familiar with full cost accounting rules, we must calculate the 10% discounted after tax value of our proved reserves by country using flat year-end prices and costs for the entire life of the reserve base. If the calculated discounted value is less than our net paring value the excess must be written off. This is generally called a ceiling test write off or impairment. I want to emphasize that the reported impairment is a non-cash charge and in no way impacts our ongoing financial flexibility. Roger Plank will provide more details in his comments in a moment.  Today’s discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions and no assurance can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located on our Web site. In addition any non gap numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or costs incurred will be identified as such as the reconciliation located on our Website at www.apachecorp.com. I’ll also mention we routinely put up important information on our Website. On today’s call Steve Farris, our Chairman and CEO and Roger Plank, our President will make prepared remarks prior to taking questions and with that I’ll turn the call over to Steve.
G. Steven Farris:  Apache accomplished a great deal during the past year and I’d like to share with you some of those highlights. On the expiration side we had a steady stream of major discoveries across our regions, resulted in a 118% reserve replacement from the [rail] bid alone. We delivered progress on our major development projects, scheduled to come on line in the first half of 2009. And we took important steps in advancing Apache’s next generation of project. And going in, in 2009 importantly we managed our cash flow wisely, so we entered 2009 with $4 billion of readily available firepower.  Three major one off uncontrollable events occurred during 2008, which really distort our reported results for the year. Production was affected by hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and an explosion on a pipeline, which transports all of our gas production in Australia. As a result, our production declined 5% during the year. And if you exclude these two events production would have grown 2% in 2008. Approximately 25% of both our gross operated oil and gas remain offline in the Gulf region. We’re waiting on pipeline repairs to restore those volumes. We’re hopeful of having all those volumes restored by the second quarter of 2009, but the timing in nearly every instance is out of our control. And the third major one off event which is reflected in our earnings is the collapse in oil and gas prices and a resulting write down which Bob just outlined for you briefly. I do want to emphasize that this is a non-cash item. I’d like to turn to reserves for 2008 before price change we grew our crude reserve base for the 23rd consecutive year. In particular as I said we replaced 118% of our production through the drill bit alone and this is significant when you consider we did not book any substantial reserves from our resource place such as Ootla. So we’re talking about 232 million barrels of oil equivalent of discoveries and extensions in the year and we’re proud of our team for it. Our year-end reserve calculations included a negative reserve revision of 64 million barrels associated with year-end commodity prices, which means we close the year with 2.4 billion barrels oil equivalent of crude reserves. Nearly all of the reserves affected were located in North America, primarily represented long life oil properties in the U.S. and royalty changes and high cost gas, shallow gas in Canada. The negative revisions in North America were partially of set by positive revisions in Egypt, and that’s due to the cost recovery component of our production sharing arrangement that requires more reserves to recover prior spending when commodity prices are lower. For those of you that focus on finding and development cost, I’d like to note that our 2008 results point to a finding and development cost for BOE up over $20 a barrel and we calculated to be $23.43 from additions only. In relation to this I need to point out three major issues.  First our F&D capital spending in 2008 on infrastructure was uniquely high. We spent over $700 million on facilities and platforms associated with construction and upgrades. A good portion of this is associated with projects in Australia and Egypt that will begin production in first half of 2009. Second we spent almost $950 million on developing crude undeveloped locations in 2008. And again about a third of this is on Van Gogh, which is our Australian oil development and it will move into the crude developed category in 2009. We really focused on delivering projects over booking new crude undeveloped locations, and as a result you might notice that our crude undeveloped as a percentage of our total decline from 31% to 28%. And thirdly I might point out that funding and development cost is only one side of the coin. Our resource and project profile is very different from most North American large cap independents. The other side of the coin is that our cash quote per barrel is consistently in the upper end of the peer group, which means that barrels are worth paying for. And finally in 2008 we didn’t outspend our cash flow, we didn’t chase costly deals and nor did we enter into expensive leases for large blocks of acreage with short-term expirations. As a result we entered 2009 with nearly $4 billion and a readily available firepower, which consists of over $1.5 billion in cash and short-term securities and $2.3 billion line of credit. We end the year with a 23% debt cap, half to be write down and penned if we excluded the cash we have in our balance sheet.  I’d like now to discuss some of our operational highlights in 2008 and really focus on the fourth quarter developments. For the year we drove 1057 net wells, with a 92% success rate. During the fourth quarter we drilled 380 wells with a 93% success rate.  On the expiration front we had a number of Apache landmark discoveries during the year, and some of those highlights include the following. In Egypt we had a steady stream of significant discoveries during the year, across basins in place and most notably the following two. [Heget] which is in the Matruh concession and the Northern part of the [Colvec] concession, we found an accumulation of 200 Bcf of gas, which will end up going through train three and four that I’ll talk about here in a minute. And on the southwestern end of the concession we discovered a West Kalabsha C-1X, which is in a Faghur basin during the fourth quarter and it tested nearly 5000 barrels of oil and day and is confirmed a new deep light oil flight. In Australia, the [Hagar] discovery found 150 BCF of gas near Varanus Island, we’re currently in the design phase of its development. In the fourth quarter we had a successful discovery in the [Bam bra nine], near the Varanus Island, and we’re studying ways to bring that back through the island. In the Gulf of Mexico the Geauxpher discovery identified a large accumulation of gas on garden bank 462, our Geauxpher project is expected to commence production in May at a net rate of about $50 million a day. And during the fourth quarter we stepped out with a successful well and garden bank 463 which was an appraisal well, shallow and we took it deeper and we found 150 feet of gas in deeper sand. In terms of our development projects, we delivered progress on the major development projects, which are going to underpin Apache's visible production growth in 2009 and beyond. In Egypt, two additional gas-processing plants are expected to reach full production of 100 million a day, and 5,000 barrels of oil a day in May of 2009. Also in Egypt, we drilled 203 water plugged wells and ended the year with up 76,000 barrels of oil per day, of gross production from water plugged field, which is a 12,000-barrel a day increase from 2007. I might point out that water plug production now underpins 50% of our crude oil production in Egypt and continues to grow. In the Gulf of Mexico, during the fourth quarter, we completed a very successful drilling and recompletion program. It's [nearing] Bank 826. We've increased production from about September of '07, from 700 barrels a day to 6,300 barrels a day by the end of the fourth quarter of 2008. In Canada, we drilled 96 coal bed methane wells during the fourth quarter, leading to a North Grant Land production record for the region, earlier this year. In the North Sea, we completed 11 new development wells in the giant Forties field, including four wells during the fourth quarter. These 11 wells flowed at a combined rate of 18,900 barrels a day of light sweet oil. In Australia, the Van Gogh development remains on schedule, with first production of 20,000 barrels of oil a day, net and is expected to come online in May 2009. Our Pyrenees development, which is operated by BHP, also remains on track and should be on in the first quarter of 2010 with an additional 20,000 barrels a day, net to Apache. And thirdly, we took important steps in shaping our next generation of projects. In Egypt, we made four discoveries in a new area called [Habba] Ridge, which is adjacent to the Asala Ridge waterflood area and East Bahariya concession. These discoveries have the potential to recover 20 to 30 million barrels of oil, through waterflooding. In January of 2009, we secured 154 Bcf, seven-year gas sales contract, which underpins our Reindeer development in Australia. Our Reindeer development will start up in mid-2011 and the contract will net back prices to Apache, three to four times the $2.00 price we've received on average over the past decade. In Canada, we completed seven successful horizontal wells in the Ootla play in 2008, with an additional five wells waiting on completion, and nine wells with surface casing preset. And we're now moving toward a full-scale development plan. I'm going to talk a little bit about our 2009 outlook, and as a result of the accomplishments that we just talked about, we project production growth in 2009, from 6% to 14% for the year. I need to make it clear that we're driving to stay within our cash flow in 2009. If commodity prices continue to fall, we'll likely land in the bottom half of that range. Currently, our 2009 capital spending levels are based on cash flow estimates, using $4.50 for natural gas, and $40 for oil, which translates in a budget of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. We will scale back spending further if commodity price stays at current levels. We're reviewing our capital monthly, if not weekly. We are a flexible and entrepreneurial organization, which enables us to make the best value decisions as market circumstances continue to evolve. Now, I might point out that presently service costs don't make any sense. Oil is below $40 a barrel, but most costs still remain at levels reached when oil was about $100. And I know service costs historically lag commodity prices three to six months, but frankly, we expect significant external cost deflation through 2009, and potentially beyond. Given that backdrop, we're following our directional plans for 2009. All regions have significantly reduced capital budgets to balance the forecasted operating cash flow. In the U.S. Central region, we remain extremely cautious drilling gas wells until net back prices improve in western Oklahoma, and also plan limited activity in the Permian Basin. Fortunately, these areas have pretty decline rates, and we do not have large acreage positions which are facing near term lease expirations. In the Gulf of Mexico, our Hurricane Ike production recoveries and the Geauxpher discovery are both expected online during the second quarter of 2009, which should offset the decline in activity. In Canada, our major focus is to drill 25 wells at Ootla, as well as fund a 30% interest in a 24-inch pipeline that will give Apache 120 million a day of additional take away capacity. In the North Sea, we finished most of the facilities upgrade in 2008, which accounts for nearly all of the budget decrease relative to 2009. And our drilling activity in the Forties will be flat with 2008 levels. In Egypt, we intend to complete funding of our gas plants and conduct a more moderate drilling program. We should show record volume growth in 2009, with the [Ceylon] gas plants ramping up. Gross operated production has steadily ramped up, and over the last week, we averaged 630 million cubic feet of gas and 148,000 barrels of oil per day of gross operated production. In Australia, we will complete funding of Van Gogh and continue funding our Pyrenees and Reindeer projects. The Van Gogh development will not require funding until we determine which market is best suited for the asset. Our Julimar discovery is more likely to participate in an LNG development, rather than supplying the domestic western Australian market. Australia will obviously have record strong volume growth with our Van Gogh development coming online during the second quarter of 2009. I'd like to close with a couple of comments. First is Apache's a 54-year-old company, and we've been through many down cycles. And truthfully, we've never been in better shape to take advantage of opportunities, and that we think will invariably present themselves. We have a portfolio diversity and balance that is a unique strength. We don't depend exclusively on North American, high volatile gas markets for our existence, and our pipeline of visible major projects is spread across our international regions. We enter 2009 with projected production growth, ample liquidity to pursue acquisitions, and historically Apache has been very successful during these periods, and I'm extremely confident that we'll emerge an even stronger company as the cycle ultimately turns. My final comment is – I hope the gentleman is listening in – it's Raymond Plank, who is synonymous with Apache. As many of you might know, Raymond retired on January 15, after being the only Chairman and Founder that we've had. For those of you who don't know him, I think you would agree he's one of a kind. He started Apache in 1954 with $250,000 from family and friends, and depending on the stock price today, we've grown to a $25 billion organization. And when you consider the adjusted price of those shares, in 1954, were $0.04, it's been a hell of a ride. So, Raymond, on behalf of our employees certainly, and I think all of them I know in this room feel that way, and all of them around the globe and our shareholders, we're very indebted to you. And thank you for your wisdom, your warmth, your friendship and support, over many, many years. And we wish you all the best. Roger.
Roger B. Plank: Okay, thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. From a financial standpoint, Apache finished 2008 with a very tough quarter. Her write-down nearly eliminated what otherwise would have been outstanding earnings in a year that would have been our best ever. It’s little consolation that even with the write-down Apache's $706 million of income still stacked up as the sixth highest in our 54 years. Clearly, 2008 will go down as the year of extremes. From an earnings perspective, we had our best quarter ever and our worst quarter ever, all in the same year. Bob commented on the magnitude of the write-down and how it's calculated, and I just wanted to touch on a couple of things before moving on.  You may be aware that in December, the SEC issued new rules on how to calculate the ceiling test. The old rule requires that in comparing the discounted present worth of properties against their historical costs, we must use prices, as of a single day and time and then hold that price flat, forever. The new rule updates that approach, allowing companies to use the prior 12-month average price, the theory being that this is a better price indicator than a single day's price. Three points – under the new rule, we'd have avoided a write-down all together, at least for now, because the previous months' highs, in terms of prices, would have muted the impact of recently lower prices in determining an average. However, the revised rule does not take effect until the end of this year.  Secondly, we are required to use cost levels and Bob went into this, or mentioned this, touched on this, cost levels as of year end for the entire life of the properties, and clearly this doesn’t make any sense as estimating economic value of reserves at lower commodity prices historically result in lower service cost. It’s just that there’s a lag. So the calculation misses this. You just can’t assume that $40 per barrel oil revenue against cost levels generated in the $100 plus per barrel price environment and expect to have a fully valid answer from an economic perspective. And then the third thing and more importantly, this is a 30-year-old rule that’s clearly outmoded or it wouldn’t be being updated today. Obviously a 12-month historic average price is a better answer but it too has its limitations and should not be confused as a statement about market value.  The point is, the methodology for calculating the ceiling has little to do with how properties are valued in the real world. It also has nothing to do with the underlying earnings and cash flow comparability of a company and capability of a company. That being said, if the calculation, it should not be ignored but it’s probably best set aside in order to make an apples-to-apples comparison of results, which is what I now intend to do in comparing the fourth quarter to the third.  Prices created from the third quarter to the fourth, dropping our oil and gas realizations 50% and 36% respectively, this caused revenues to decline over 40% sequentially at just under $2 billion in the fourth quarter. Excluding the write-down fourth quarter earnings totaled $701 million or $2.08 a share. This includes a $272 million or $0.81 a share foreign exchange benefit in deferred taxes following the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and a $152 million or $0.45 per share benefit largely from a favorable resolution of tax audits. Cash from operations decreased 49% to $1.1 billion compared to third quarter. That’s a substantial decline but it’s not unexpected given that the world economy is currently in shambles. While a lot of products have no market at all today, we are very fortunate to be in the oil and gas business where all our products sell everyday. As Steve likes to say, “We don’t sell widgets.” Costs remain an issue for both Apache and the industry as a whole, as they have not come down nearly as quickly as prices. Listing cost for BOE rose to $10.91 from $10.39 last quarter, a vestige of yesterday's rising commodity price environment. The quarter also included several items outside of our base running rate, most significantly hurricane repair costs related to Ike.  Our 2009 goal is to reduce listing costs per unit by 10% as our volumes rise and lagging cost declines catch up to the reality of lower prices. Recurring whole cost DD&A, and this is pre write-down, increased 10% sequentially to $13.09 per BOE. Parenthetically I'd note that each dollar of write-down is a dollar we don’t have to amortize in the future. So between that and drilling costs, which are starting to moderate, our whole cost DD&A rate should drop below $12 a barrel equivalent. G&A costs increased to $1.47 per BOE from $1.23; however, we should be between those rates as we go forward. Severance and other taxes of $2.92 per BOE, selling half on lower oil and gas prices; this could fall in half again depending on whether today’s lower prices hold.  Finance expense increased $0.32 to $1.03 per BOE with the additional $800 million of 6.5% notes issued in the fourth quarter as credit markets tightened. We also completed a project financing for the Van Gogh and Pyrenees projects on which we drew $100 million in December. This increased our cash on hand enabling us to end the year with just under $2 billion of cash and Treasuries. I would caution, however, that the first quarter is expected to see a draw down in that amount for costs that carried over year end, including $125 million in Egyptian cash calls, an estimated $135 million to the U.K. for PRT tax and we also plan to retire $100 million of Australian notes that mature this quarter. Turning to income taxes, our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 40% but if you remove the noise associated with adjusted earnings, our effective tax rate would have been 36%. Steve earlier underscored many of the highlights achieved during 2008.  I would add that we have a saying at Apache that “what we won’t do, is as important as what we will do.” For the longest time, I didn’t fully appreciate what that meant but can size it up like this. During the frothy upswing, Apache did not outspend cash flow, choosing instead to reduce our debt to cap and to build a significant cash hoard. We did not submit to the strategy du jour of buying in shares at new highs or jacking up dividends to unsustainable levels and we did not lower financial flexibility on deals at the peak of the cycle.  We have been on the acquisition sidelines for two years. We looked but didn’t buy and as a result, we have significant firepower intact when it really counts. Would we have done some things differently had we known how rapidly prices would fall? Absolutely, but by taking a long term approach and staying our own course, we find ourselves in a very competitive position with production on the rise, access to credit at favorable rates and a meaningful amount of opportunity money with which to address today’s not insignificant challenges and opportunities.  With that, we would be happy to answer any questions. 
Operator:  (Operator instructions) Your first question will go to David Heikkinen- Tudor Pickering Holt.
David Heikkinen – Tudor Pickering Holt: I just had a quick question thinking about your Gulf of Mexico volumes and the recovery and then the additional volumes coming in from Geauxpher. What are the major systems that we should watch or is there some way we can get an idea of ratios if that comes back this year?
G. Steven Farris: Well, at least from my projection standpoint, we really should be fully operational on our shut in production about the middle of the second quarter, I mean, if you look at our timing. With respect to Geauxpher, we expect to have that on in May. That will be just an event, if you know what I mean. We’ll go from zero to hopefully 50 million net to us a day.
David Heikkinen – Tudor Pickering Holt:   And given that you’ve been in recovery operations, normal declines, I mean you don’t get back to the pre-storm volumes, how do you think about what declines you would have as you have been trying to recover or do you have any areas where you think you've re-pressured reservoirs and you will actually get some incremental production?
G. Steven Farris: You know, it obviously declines – I don’t have those numbers in front of me. I know if we, from a 2009 plan standpoint, if we get the recovery that we’re projecting we lost a little bit obviously. We wrote off a few reserves just because of the hurricane at the end of the year, but with the 50 million a day coming in from Geauxpher we should be slightly ahead to flat in the Gulf of Mexico this year. 
David Heikkinen – Tudor Pickering Holt:  And then in Egypt, as commodity prices, as oil prices have come down, you get the splits between cost barrels and your profit barrels that impact your overall volumes. How do we think about the variability of production that’s tied to the change in commodity price?
G. Steven Farris: Well, frankly, I go by our gross operated production and if you look at our gross operated production, we have been steadily increasing throughout the year and we should, when we get these two plants on, we should be at – started out about $520 million a day at the beginning of 2007.  By the first – end of the – May of second quarter, we'll be at about $850 million a day of gas and about 165,000 barrels of liquid, because you really have a hard time looking at net-net numbers in terms of how you book the cost recovery component. It's just – know this, when prices go down we're going to book more per dozen.
David Heikkinen- Tudor Pickering Holt: Right. Yes, you get more production as these prices have come down, and they steadily have come down so you'll have some boost to '09 that hopefully reverses itself as oil prices come back. But I was trying to think through that logic. I understand the gross is growing but you also will get a net growth as well in addition to that. 
G. Steven Farris: That's correct.
Roger B. Plank: But there's no simple formula, we've tried to simplify it and you've really just got to run it through the model and based on whatever the price is, but you got the direction right.
Unidentified Corporate Participant: David, you also have about 12 different concessions that all have their own particular cost tool. So it's very difficult, as we've spoken before, to model that because you'd have to have a model on every one. And you'd have to know how much spending we had made in every one, so. 
David Heikkinen- Tudor Pickering Holt: Yes, I won't be able to get that; I was trying to an order of magnitude. And I think we've talked about it before, but it's net positive versus just the overall projects that you have coming in as we lower our oil prices is it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tom Gardner – Simmons & Co.
Tom Gardner – Simmons & Co.:  I just wanted to get an update on the Gas Plus and the Oil Plus programs in Argentina.
G. Steven Farris: Yes, we are actually, and I think I said this on the last call, we are actually drilling wells at EFO, which is one of those projects. And we are actually restricting capital in Argentina right now, but the one area that we're not restricting is our EFO development, because we're hopeful to be able to put that gas into the market. I really can't comment on the Oil Plus because we have one project that we're doing. It's a horizontal project down there, that we just started drilling. Our first well made over 500 barrels a day, but that's early in the cycle.
Tom Gardner – Simmons & Co.:  And Steven, I wanted to get an update on your thoughts on the optimum timing of an acquisition, and do you see the bid-ask spreads closing?
G. Steven Farris:  I think, and this is my Steve Farris add on, but I think you're going – everybody is going to be very discouraged when they look at first quarter pricing. What we have the fourth quarter, even though we took a feeling-test kit, our average price was much higher than the average price is going to be in the fourth quarter. And that's not just for us, that's going to be from the Exxons to the little guys.  And I think when we get first quarter realizations of what our cash flow; all of our cash flows are going to be. There's going to be a real convergence of the selling price and the buying price of assets. And I -– so we're, truthfully, we're just kind of settling our peak right now until after the first quarter.
Tom Gardner – Simmons & Co.:  I wanted to get your view on the oil markets. You may have been one of the few that really saw the weak environment coming to any degree. So, going forward what do you think? When would we see a recovery?
G. Steven Farris:  Well, and I really mean this, we do look at our business long term. So in terms of, is it going to be six months? We've got an awful lot of pain in the economy and I think you could linger it where we are for some time. Having said that, if you also think that we're still producing, or consuming, as a world 83 million barrels of oil a day and you think of how much capital is going to come out of this business.  I don't know if it's two years from now or three years from now but, regrettably, I think we're going to see the same thing that we saw at $140 oil. I mean, I really do. I don't think you can stop that 83 million barrels a day on a dime.
Tom Gardner – Simmons & Co.:  Yes. Your thoughts on LNG, are prices likely to stay low enough domestically to keep it in Asia and Europe to a large degree?
G. Steven Farris:  I think the United States is facing some LNG imports in 2010. If you think about some of the very big guys in the world that have LNG coming on during that timeframe, I think it's possible that you could see bigger quantities of LNG starting to test these markets in the U.S.
Tom Gardner – Simmons & Co.:  Does that portend for a gas price recovery in your view domestically in 2010?
G. Steven Farris: I think we're – my honest opinion and it is I think we better run to get our cost down on the gas side. I think we – people don't recognize that we've gone from a nine-year reserve life to a 100-year reserve life. And I think that's going to be indicative of prices going forward. I think, in this country, I think the guy that wins is the guy that can do it the cheapest and do it the most efficiently.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs
Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs:  Two questions, first question on Julimar, you mentioned that you continue to expect that it will be associating more with an LNG project. Can you provide any of the latest color in terms of how you're thinking about timing and cost?
G. Steven Farris:  Well, there's two, as you know Brian, I mean there are two competing LNG projects that are very near to us over there. One is a major oil company and the other one is a major LNG player but it's smaller. And, frankly, we are discussing those options with both of them. I would expect some time in the – actually I'm going to give myself because Reindeer I said we were going to have that done for months, so I'm going to be careful.  I would expect something to happen on that during 2009, in terms of some kind of commitments of where we would go with that gas. There are some differences, which I'd just as soon not go into because it's there are some differences in the structure of those two opportunities. And also of the timing of which they are going to be built or were built, which has an impact on cost. Do you understand what I'm saying?  Because costs are going to come, you know, a major supplier that built our plants in Egypt, we have talked to him about building our third train now. Yes, it's our third new train, our fifth train. And they have one project around the world that they've got in front of them now versus where they were six, eight months ago. So, all of those costs, fuel costs etc. are going to be significantly lower than they were during the boom. And I think that's going to have some impact on the way we look at Julimar and where we go with it.
Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs:  And secondly, in Egypt and Argentina what are seeing in terms of gas demand trends given the economic climate and maybe some comments on gas prices on the margin?
G. Steven Farris:  Well, it's interesting because I – if you probably are going to look at the first quarter of 2009, with either a gas price in Egypt that is equal to or close to what we're getting in the United States. And that's not, regrettably, that's not because one of them is going up and the other one is staying there. It's because one of them is coming down. I don't recall what our average price was in the fourth quarter in Egypt on gas.
Roger B. Plank: $4.13. 
G. Steven Farris:  $4.13? Now, when we get new volumes on that's going to start drifting down just because it's a lower price. But we should net back to us probably in the $3.50 range to Apache. And given gas today is a little over $4.00 in the United States, and that's at NYMEX, I would suspect that our gas price in Egypt in the first quarter, with an additional $100 million today coming on, is going to be higher.
Roger B. Plank: And you might have gathered from Steve comment about the fifth train that there's still very strong demand for additional [inaudible].
G. Steven Farris: Very much so. And the reason is, regardless of the price of crude oil in Egypt, they just don't have enough of it. And so what they're trying to do is whatever dollars that they can get, because basically they have to import products, so whatever price they can get for their crude oil is hard dollars and their gas is used internally. And it's still a very strong market for gas. In Argentina, and again, this is bittersweet, but regrettably, our Argentine price doesn't look so bad anymore. We’re still selling our Dow contract; actually starting in 2009 that Dow contract will be $3.50. Now that's not much gas, but in the fourth quarter of '08 we averaged $1.85. And I would suspect probably Argentine gas prices are going to continue to go up on an average. Certainly we're not going to threaten the $9.00 we've seen in the United States, but I don't think the United States is going to threaten $9.00.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Allman – JP Morgan.
Joseph Allman – JP Morgan: Yes, thank you. Could you comment on your outlook for production out of the Ootla shale? What the production is now? What do you think about year-end '09, year later? Just give us a sense of the growth there?
G. Steven Farris: Well, it depends on how we develop that right now. Right now we're drilling wells and presetting casing, and we're going to back in the fall and complete those wells. We're doing about 20 million a day right now of gas out of the wells that we've got on. Interestingly, the last well, actually EnCana drilled, but we have 50% in also, four months later is still making 5 million a day. So it's holding up very well. That's the only well that we've actually got 10 fracs on. So from a reservoir standpoint we're very encouraged about what we see. In terms of timing, we probably start ramping up production not until about the end of 2009. So where you're really going to start seeing some – depending on what happens to prices – you're probably going to see the first meaningful gas coming out of Ootla area in 2010.
Joseph Allman – JP Morgan: And then in terms of acquisition, you suggested that you're in the market for making acquisitions. What are you looking for in particular and don't you have enough to keep yourselves busy now and to invest all the capital that you've got available to you at this point?
G. Steven Farris: Certainly we have, and truthfully we have more opportunities than we have cash right now. And we're being very selective about how we spend those dollars. We are a growth company. Apache, in 54 years, has been very acquisitive. We do not look for acquisitions that just have production. We look for acquisitions that add acreage and have upsides and that can be a long-term part of our portfolio a la Egypt. Now we bought Repsol out of Egypt in 2001 and that was the other half of the greater call to area. And we've got 42 rigs still running in Egypt. That's going to go down, but that was a huge, huge win for us. You would hardly ever see us make an acquisition just for the production. So what we'd like to be able to do is put ourselves in a position to add some growth potential for the next several years out of an acquisition we could make when prices are relatively low, rather than buy at the high end of the market. Same reason you buy a stock when it's down is you expect it to go up. We'd much rather invest dollars in a much saner environment than we would at higher prices.
Joseph Allman – JP Morgan: Okay, that's helpful.
Roger B. Plank: Somebody earlier asked about the right time for acquisitions and when do things pick up? And the real answer to that is that timing's coming our way. But the real answer is in Steve's last answer to this question, and that is when we see something to which we can add value that brings us a lot of opportunities, that's in a market where you aren't stretching every assumption in order to get a deal done, then that's when you add. Rather than to try to pick the exact right time with respect to pricing because that's pretty difficult to do, as we all know.
Joseph Allman – JP Morgan: And I suppose you weigh that against things like buying back stock or paying off debt and other opportunities, as well. Is that correct?
Roger B. Plank: Well, we certainly do against paying down debt. Occasionally we'll weigh it against buying back stock, but I can tell you along the lines of Steve's comments about we are a growth company for 54 years. This kind of environment is the kind of environment where we vastly prefer to look for opportunities that build a better business.
Joseph Allman – JP Morgan: Okay. And then, Steve, you made a comment about how – you suggested that the funding costs were higher because of the facilities and construction and other costs that you incurred in 2008. Are there others – are there costs like that in 2009 that might make '09 funding costs higher than the other ones would be?
G. Steven Farris: The only place that we have significant infrastructure left, frankly, because most of it we probably see a little of it in the first quarter out of the gas plants in Egypt and a little first quarter Van Gogh. But past that, certainly Reindeer won't start up until later in 2009 – the actual construction and spending, because we don't come on until 2011. So we're pretty well funded with what we see right now. Now and again, most things there's always two sides – we'd love to have something that we could start spending money on. But right now we're pretty well funded, those projects that will come online in 2009.
Joseph Allman – JP Morgan: Great, and then just two quick ones. How about pv10 for at the end of '08? What was pv10?
G. Steven Farris: I'm looking around the room.
Roger B. Plank: Joe, I'll get that one for you offline. We don't have it right in front of us. We're working on our K so...
Joseph Allman – JP Morgan: Great, thanks. And then lastly, revisions, of the revisions, how much were approved developed and how much were PUDs?
G. Steven Farris: We'll have to get that for you offline.
Roger B. Plank: I'll get one for you, too.
Operator: Your next question is from Gil Yang – Citigroup.
Gil Yang – Citigroup: Hi. Going back to Ootla for a second, could you, now that you're in full development mode does that mean that you're pretty comfortable with what the wells are doing in terms of what your program is in terms of fracs, completions and can you outline what you think the ITs and the URs are going to be at that stabilized level?
G. Steven Farris: Well, we project that the latest well that we drilled is probably going to 7.5 v's. And that's with ten fracs. I will tell you, we've got five wells that we've actually had some production on. But we're fairly confident. At least our engineers and our petrophysicists are pretty confident that with a larger number of fracs we could recover 10 Bcf per well. In terms of our – from a reservoir standpoint now, we've only been in two areas, and we've got 400,000 acres. So we're extrapolating a long – it's more than an Oklahoma step-out. But certainly all of the wells that have been drilled so far have been very similar. This program that we're doing this winter and throughout the year will be very important to us in terms of drainage, etc. But at some level this project is going to go forward. And the question is how big is big? Certainly we're confident enough to join in putting a 24-inch pipeline that's going to take 700 million a day out of there of which we’ll have 30% of. So we’re going to increase our available capacity significantly over the next year.
Gil Yang – Citigroup: What is the cost? What do you think the cost is going to level out at?
G. Steven Farris: Level at I don’t know yet honestly. You’re looking at every service that we talk to comes down daily frankly and it will continue to come down until it reaches a point of which it's commensurate with a return on the prices that you’re getting for the commodity. It never fails.
Gil Yang – Citigroup: All right, well, maybe I used the wrong term but in terms of your technological improvements where do you think the wells are going to cost at today’s cost?
G. Steven Farris: At today’s cost about $7 million.
Gil Yang – Citigroup: Seven million. And you cited I think to Joe's question about Ootla, you said that it was one well and so increasing to 5 million a day what was his IT and how long has it been and has it surfaced and is the infrastructure constrained at all?
G. Steven Farris: It’s not constrained it came on actually instantaneous rate or at the 12 hour rate. It came on about 12 million a day originally and declined obviously significantly early. But it’s relatively flat for a shale well and at 5 million a day after four months is a very good rate.
Gil Yang – Citigroup: Okay, and is it your view that Ootla at today’s prices would be economic?
G. Steven Farris: On a well by well basis it would be economic; on an infrastructure basis probably not. But you’re going to have to spend some of that money in order to get there. You understand what I’m saying. 
Gil Yang – Citigroup: Absolutely. And then just a question you mentioned in the royalty in the revisions downward that royalties played a role in that could you – I thought the royalty regime sort of kicked into place at the end of 2007 so wouldn’t that have affected 2007 reserves?
Steven Farris: No this was the first year – and it was Alberta government royalties that have the impact and were significant.
Gil Yang – Citigroup: So it didn’t affect your reserves in '07 only the reserves in '08.
G. Steven Farris: That’s correct. 
Roger B. Plank:  And that was about half of the Canadian revision.
Unidentified Corporate Participant: Maybe it might have been that it was announced and it didn’t come into effect until 2008. 
Gil Yang – Citigroup: Right, so you didn’t have to calculate ’07 reserves based on that. 
Roger B. Plank: Right, because it wasn’t implemented until ’08.
Operator: Your next question comes from Leo Mariani – RBC.
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets:  Question on CapEx for 2009 you guys talked about $3.5 billion to $4 billion. I know that’s a moving target. Could you guys put any numbers around kind of where the money may get spent if it’s possible to say 20% in Australia, 10% in North Sea or any sort of [big] islands like that?
G. Steven Farris: I don’t have it in front of me. Let me tell you where – we probably spent $800 million in Central region and we’re probably going to spend $400 million in the Central region. And these are just directionally if you understand what I’m saying. We spent probably $1.5 billion in the Gulf Coast and we’ll probably spend something like $1 billion in Canada, most of which is our Ootla we’re probably down $350 million there. I think we’re going to spend about $500 million. In Egypt we’re trying to be – now we had the gas plants in ’08 so you’re not looking at – it's not having as much effect on the drilling, but Egypt we’re going to be about $800 million. And the North Sea about $300 million and the rest of it is change if you understand what I’m saying.
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, you guys talked about your Gulf of Mexico shut -ns being roughly 25% of your volume. Can you kind of quantify what that number is going to be?
G. Steven Farris: You mean the order – actual numbers?
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: Yes.
G. Steven Farris: No I don’t have those numbers in front of me. I’m sure Bob could get them for you. I just looked at a curve but I don’t want to – I’d rather not say. You just need to get that number offline. I mean we’ve got it I just can’t remember that particular number and I don’t want to give you a ballpark.
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: Sure okay. I think you guys were drilling some wells in the Gippsland base in Australia kind of late last year and wanted to see if you had any results out in that part. I think there was a couple big prospects you guys were looking at.
G. Steven Farris: We had a very good program that turned up with some uneconomic discoveries, frankly. We drilled – the [Dore] well had a nice sand with hydrocarbons in it. It turned into being gas rather than oil which where it was in the world is not going to be economic. And the other two turned out to be – had sand in them but were actually didn’t have a charge so we drilled three dry holes there. And that doesn’t condemn the Gippsland frankly I just – the ship's gone and we’re going to study it and probably go back to drilling in 2010.
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, anything else on the drawing board in the exploration side for Australia ’09 or are you guys kind of taking a break over there?
G. Steven Farris: No. We've got a well up in Browse that we’re getting ready to drill. We get our ship back. We’re getting ready to drill in oil prospect up in Browse. We’ve got a project that’s offsetting our Van Gogh Pyrenees development. That’s a smaller oil play but it could be a very good add on.  We’ve got a couple of gas wells that we’re going to drill in the Carnarvon basin down toward Varanus Island. We’ll probably drill because of our discussion on where to go with the gas we’ll probably drill a couple of appraisal well at our 356 our Julimar block that are going to be important wells for – to establish crude reserves if you understand what I’m saying. So we got a program; it’s more modest than it was in 2008 for sure.
Operator: We go next to David Tameron with Wachovia.
David Tameron – Wachovia Securities: Good afternoon. Most of the questions have been answered just one follow-up, and you briefly mentioned I was looking at the regional F&Ds in the Gulf Coast. Can you talk X3 visions? Can you talk about – I think you mentioned there was some deep water wells included in that number. Can you talk about what exactly went into that CapEx number?
G. Steven Farris: Yes. There was a significant amount of infrastructure not all associated with the hurricane. The other thing I would say is is that we have timing difference in the Gulf of Mexico and that is the difference between when you book the reserves and when you drill the wells. We drilled a very expensive well out south 10-308 that was an exploration well to a deeper target that turned out to be a dry hole. The biggest is timing differences and that's just year-over-year, if you understand what I’m saying and the Gulf of Mexico is a high cost area. I mean we saw historic high cost in the Gulf. That’s not indicative the way the program should go, but it certainly was that way in 2008 for all kinds of reasons, one of which is the hurricanes.
David Tameron – Wachovia Securities: Okay, and when I look at grouping of your U.S. production how much of that – what sense [inaudible] versus Gulf Coast, like how much onshore is included in that Gulf coast number?
G. Steven Farris:  About $100 million a day Gross.
Operator: Your next question is from Kevin Smith – Raymond James.
Kevin Smith – Raymond James:  Two questions, is there price that you kind of cut back drilling in the Ootla in ’09?
G. Steven Farris: We – I guess there is a price. Right now we are for a lot of reasons. One is we really want to do a pad drilling and experiment with fracs etc. in a orderly fashion. So we are going to drill those wells in 2009. That is going to be part of our program and we’re going to complete them and we’re gong to put them on. And at a if oil – I mean gas prices to decline certainly we’re spending money for the future. We’re not spending money for now when we do that. And we fully recognize that.
Kevin Smith – Raymond James: Makes sense. And the second question can you give me a feel for what demand’s like in Argentina or is gas demand – are they still importing large amounts or has some of that maybe kind of fallen off. 
G. Steven Farris: Well we’ll see as we go into their winter but in terms of the actual need for natural gas in Argentina that hasn’t let up at all. They are behind the eight ball with respect to gas demand versus supply.
Operator: And with that ladies and gentleman we have no further questions on our roster. Therefore Mr. Dye I’ll turn the conference back over to you for any closing remarks.
Bob Dye:  Thanks for joining us. If anyone has any questions feel free to call us after the call, and thank you very much.
Operator: And again ladies and gentleman this does conclude the Apache Corporation fourth quarter and year end earnings 2008 conference call. We do appreciate your participation and you may disconnect at this time.

===== 2008 Q3  (2008-10-30 14:00:00) =====
Executives: Bob Dye - Vice President of Investor Relations G. Steven Farris - President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Director Roger B. Plank - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President

Operator: Welcome to the Apache Corporation third quarter earnings 2008 conference call. This call is being recorded. Today’s presentation will be hosted by Mr. Bob Dye, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Bob Dye: Thanks for joining us today. This morning Apache Corporation released third quarter 2008 results which totaled net income of $1.2 billion or $3.52 per diluted share and cash flow of $2.1 billion. Today’s discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions and no assurance can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located on our website. In addition any non-GAAP numbers that we discussed such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or costs incurred will be identified as such with the reconciliation located on our website at www.apachecorp.com. I’ll note that we routinely put important information on our website. As an example last week we had an analyst meeting in Houston and we currently have slides from that meeting on our website for your review. On today’s call Steve Farris, our CEO, and Roger Plank, our CFO, will make prepared remarks prior to taking questions. With that I’ll turn the call over to Steve.
G. Steven Farris: Thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings conference call. During the quarter Apache’s international portfolio once again demonstrated its strength and momentum through drilling success and our sustained progress in delivering our pipeline development projects, and strong earnings of $3.52. I’d like to echo Bob’s comments and thank all of those who attended our yearly analyst conference last week in Houston. We really did appreciate the opportunity to walk through some of the details of our portfolio and the growth plays that we have that we’re presenting around the world. I’d encourage those who did not listen to view our website and listen to our webcast. Today in my remarks I’d like to review just quickly our position and our outlook, and then give you some activity highlights from our regions. First of all, Apache’s in a very strong and honestly differentiated position in the current volatile environment. Our portfolio is balanced which benefits our shareholders across multiple business environments. That means we’re balanced across products, pricing benchmarks, international basins and play types. We also hold strong positions in all the places we operate. We’re the number one producer in Egypt’s Western Desert. We’re the number two producer in Western Australia. We’re the number one producer in the US Gulf of Mexico shelf. We’re the number three producer in Oklahoma. Along with our partner in Canada we’re the number one producer in the Ootla shale play in Canada. Our strategic platforms in building value in mature basins, our international exploration and global graphs are aligned with long-term realities for this energy industry. We’re financially stronger than we’ve ever been. We have seven development projects underway that alone are expected to add about 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent to our production over the next four years. We have a resource depth as we updated in our conference last week with 9.8 barrels equivalent of resource potential on our 36 million acres across the globe. Finally and probably most importantly, Apache’s culture has gotten to this point and that strength will continue to guide us in the future. I’d like to summarize quickly our immediate outlook. In the short term we intend to live within our means. We’ve been living within our means for a number of years now which puts us in a very comfortable relative position in the industry. We’re going to stick with our conservative principles and we review our investment plans on a quarterly basis. We’re going to remain focused on execution on two fronts: Delivering our pipeline of development projects and continuing our exploration in our ace countries of Australia, Canada and Egypt. We have a strong balance sheet. We have approximately $2 billion in cash plus another $2 billion available in credit facilities. We’ve stayed out of the asset market for some time now as the recent spike in commodity prices made good deals hard to find. Things are clearly changing now at least presently and we are going to evaluate asset opportunities selectively. We have a lot of opportunities within our portfolio and we’re not in any rush. We’d only consider opportunities that would advance our portfolio and generate long-term value for our shareholders. Last week we provided production growth perspective for 2009 of 6% to 14%. I know that’s a wide range. I think everyone would agree that uncertainty is abnormally high right now. Assuming we do recover the 2008 shut-in volumes in Australia and the Gulf of Mexico that I’ll go over in a minute, we would grow at about 6% and we expect our development projects should add another 6% to 7% for the potential of a 13% to 14% growth rate. But within that range our annual growth rate will depend upon the level of capital spending for the year and our planning process has just begun. Frankly until we get closer to 2009 and get a better idea of price and cash flow, it makes no sense to zero in on capital number at the present time. I think if you back up a little bit, we don’t make widgets. The opportunity ahead for us has never been greater. Despite the recent downturn, the world still needs energy to the tune of 85 million barrels of oil a day and ever increasing quantities of gas. Just yesterday the International Energy Agency’s upcoming annual study was quoted by the Financial Times as having found oil fields globally to a decline rate of 9.1% per year and 6.4% expected even with large investments to the tune of $360 billion. I noticed today that the IEA has said that the article was misleading and several months old but I think it does point to the fact that no one can deny that there needs to be tremendous capital in order to meet the demand over the next several years. In any event we’re going to continue to be conservative and to balance our capital program with our cash flow. With the frenzied boom time activity coming to a halt we believe it’s an opportunity to build long-term value. I’d like to address specifically the results for the quarter and Roger’s going to cover the financials in much more detail. I’m going to speak to our production for the quarter. Production as you saw I’m sure in the release was 511,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. That’s 7% below the second quarter of 2008 which is entirely due to the outages in Australia and the Gulf of Mexico, and we expect to recover substantially all of those volumes by year end. In Australia we restored partial production on Varanus Island during the third quarter of 2008 but we still lost a net of about $75 million a day and about 2,800 barrels of oil per day due to the pipeline explosion which is relative to the second quarter of ’08. Net production of 4,000 barrels of oil per day and 78 million cubic feet of gas a day remain shut in and should be restored by year end. In the US substantially all the production variance relative to the second quarter of 2008 was the restful of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Most of this shut-in production was due to pipeline and processing facility issues. As of now we anticipate those to be cleared by year end. Only 12% of our shut-in production is associated with platforms that we actually operate. Apache had four operated and two non-operated platforms which were lost. These contributed volumes of about $7.5 million a day and 1,200 barrels of oil per day in the previous totals. We expect to be able to recover all but about 1,100 barrels a day from those leases because a couple of the platforms that were lost were processing platforms instead of producing platforms which will allow us to take the production to alternative processing locations. We’re currently producing about $250 million a day and 38,000 barrels of oil per day but by year end we expect the worst to be behind us. For the year the one-off Varanus Island and hurricane events reduced our annual production growth by 3% each or 6% in total. These events didn’t affect our reserves and actually if we’re able to restore the production by year end, it gives us a leg up on 2009 growth. I’d like to now cover our regional operating highlights. For additional details I encourage you to review a lot of this material which is on our website from last week’s analyst conference. In the central region we have expanded our acreage base in the Stiles Ranch which is in the Texas Panhandle threefold since the beginning of the year and gas production exceeded $90 million a day in the area for the first time during the third quarter. In East Texas we drilled the [Folk 6H] horizontal well which was in the Bossier formation and it’s averaged about $8 million to $10 million a day for the first 90 days of production. We have the potential to drill as many as 12 offset wells. In the Gulf region the Geauxpher 2x deep water well at Garden Bank 462 is currently completing. We expect net production of about $50 million a day from the development area which should come on during the first quarter of 2009. We see the potential to drill at last three additional wells on that block next year. Also in the Gulf region during last week’s conference we showed for the first time our acreage position in the Echelford shale in Central Texas. The Echelford underlies the Gideon’s Austin Chalk field in Berlison, Brazos, Washington, Lee and Fayette counties and we have now over 450,000 acres, 425,000 of which is HBP. We have just drilled our first extended lateral. We put 10 fracs which is an experiment actually. It came on yesterday pulling over 525 barrels of oil per day. I’ve got to warn you these are early results. We have very little idea what the decline rate will be but I can tell you for sure that this rate exceeds our expectations. In Canada recent production results from wells we drilled with our partner in Canada, Ootla, suggests 7.4 bcf per well utilizing a 10-stage frac completion. Frankly we believe that there’s further reserve upside in completing these wells with even more frac stages which is what we plan to do this winter. At 7.4 bcf per well this play works with [Henry] gas prices of about $6 and represents a net recoverable resource potential of 9 to 16 tcf for Apache. In the North Sea our third quarter production achieved its highest average in two years. We’ve drilled nine wells this year that produced at a peak rate of about 17,000 barrels of oil a day during the third quarter of 2008. We have now developed a four-year drilling inventory of over 60 wells which are targeting more oil production potential like the nine wells we just completed. In Argentina we completed our 2,500 square kilometer 3D mega shoot in Tierra del Fuego which is an island on the southern tip of Argentina and have identified over 100 potential features to drill in the future. In the [Niakin] Provence we’ve had notable successes there and expect upcoming production from areas to qualify for the premium sales price under gas plus programs. In Australia we continue to develop four major projects to remain on schedule. During the third quarter we drilled primarily development wells in Carnarvon Basin. We do expect we have now taken custody of a rig for our Gibson Basin exploration program which should start next week and also potentially exposes the company to some meaningful oil reserves. Finally in Egypt we achieved record production, made four discoveries during the quarter, and East Bahariya concession which is in the [Abergudique] Basin. The D1X well found 61 feet of upper Baharia pay along the same 13 mile ridge as the C1X well that we reported last quarter. The D1X tested 1,145 barrels of oil a day and could have another water flood potential pending further appraisal along that ridge. Our third well on the ridge, the E1X actually has currently been logged and has Upper Baharia in it also. In the East [Bennie] Swift concession which is in the [Bennie] Swift Basin days are East 1X well tested 930 barrels a day which is from Aboroash G and also has water flood potential associated with it. These two discoveries are important because they potentially add to our inventory of water flood projects. We’re currently producing 37,000 barrels of oil a day from eight different water flood projects that we have undertaken in Egypt just in the last two years. In the Matru Basin on the Khalda offset concession the Sultan 3X wildcat made a gas connance safe discovery tested 5,027 barrels of oil per day and 11 million cubic feet of gas a day from [Jurassic sopic] formation. Finally yesterday I think we announced the West Colopsha concession we drilled a well that discovered oil and tested 4,746 barrels of oil per day again from the Jurasic sopa at 14,600 feet. This well is a look alike to the Heckit 2 well that we reported last quarter that’s still actually producing over 2,000 barrels a day. Both wells tested black oil from a much deeper horizon than we earlier thought possible. It’s a much cooler basin than the [Shoshone] Basin where we have the cosser gas. It opens an oil play fairway of potentially 800 square miles, mostly within Apache operated concessions and we plan several wells next year to evaluate the play. Now I’d like to turn it over to Roger.
Roger B. Plank: As the credit crunch gave way to global downturn, Apache turned in solid third quarter results and earnings nearly doubling the year earlier period. Cash flow increased by $0.5 billion or nearly 1/3. 43% higher oil prices and 49% higher gas prices in the quarter enabled oil and gas revenues to climb $870 million from third quarter ’07 to $3.4 billion. This overcame a 9% reduction in volumes and enabled earnings to outpace all but the prior quarter. As we’ve indicated in press releases and on our website, the Australian pipeline incident and Hurricanes Gustav, Ike, et al put a dent in our third quarter production. As discussed at last week’s conference these incidents constrained third quarter production to 511,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. I’d reiterate that this production is not lost forever but rather deferred. As Steve indicated, we anticipate volumes should be restored between now and year end. Foreign exchange again impacted the quarter’s results, this time on the plus side given the rebounding US dollar. Normalizing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on a deferred tax results in adjusted earnings of $3.19 per share versus $2.17 in the third quarter of ’07. Now if we compare third quarter to the second quarter of 2008, a $9 per barrel and $0.66 per mcf decline in oil and gas realizations coupled with a 7% decline in production reduced oil and gas revenues by $535 million and earnings by $254 million or 18% sequentially. Cash flow likewise declined $196 million or 8% sequentially. Cash margins declined 13% with lower prices making an impact but remain quite strong at nearly $52 per barrel of oil equivalent. Including DD&A our total pre-tax margin decreased a little over $8 to a still respectable $38.60 per barrel of oil equivalent. Now turning to cost details, lifting costs included a number of items that caused their increase to $10.39 per boe from $8.90. The start of repairs at Varanus Island and repair and maintenance work in the Gulf Coast plus increased workovers and power costs in both Egypt and the central region were primarily responsible for just over half or $0.83 per boe of the increase. Lower production accounted for the remaining increase in our unit costs because most of your base lease operating expenses offshore is fixed. It doesn’t go away with shut-ins. It just gets divided amongst fewer barrels which brings the cost per boe up. Hurricane repairs will continue to pressure lifting costs until covering our insurance deductibles. Physical damage insurance coverage is subject to a net deductible of around $7 million in Australia and $70 million in the Gulf of Mexico. The Australia deductible was satisfied in the third quarter and the Gulf deductible should be satisfied around year end. Based on present expectations we have more than enough insurance to cover costs above our deductibles in both the Gulf and Australia so once we’ve reached the deductible limit our lease operating expense should revert to normal. Full cost duty NA increased 1% sequentially to $11.93 per boe consistent with recent drilling costs. General and administrative costs decreased $0.35 to $1.22 per boe. Absolute costs were down $21 million, the result of lower stock-based compensation expense. Leaving aside any changes in stock price, rising fourth quarter production should enable a rate of somewhere around $1.25 to $1.50. Taxes other than income increased $0.53 to $6.48 per boe with $0.42 related to lower production and $0.11 primarily related to higher North Sea volumes and revenues resulting in increased PRT taxes. Finance expense decreased $0.07 to $0.71 per boe on greater interest income given higher average cash balances. I think as most of you are aware, earlier this month Apache issued $800 million of five and ten-year bonds. This will add about $13 million to our quarterly interest expense while adding to our overall fire power as well. Having the ability to tap capital is nice. To do it in the peak of the credit crisis at an average cost of under 6.5% is frankly exceptional.  The proceeds arrived October 1 so after third quarter’s end. We anticipate our cash balance at year end to be around $2 billion +/- depending on prices and the timing of production recoveries. This includes working capital changes for the impact of third quarter capital carryover into the fourth quarter and also reduced receipts following hurricane and Varanus production curtailments. Turning to income taxes, our third quarter effective tax rate decreased to 34% from 38% in the prior quarter. As mentioned earlier, our deferred tax expense benefited from the strengthening US dollar by $113 million reducing our effective tax rate. Our deferred tax percentage increased to 51% from 22% in the second quarter and that just reflects significantly lower current tax estimates given lower commodity prices. Given the heightened volatility of both commodity prices and the US dollar, estimating our future deferred tax percentage and effective tax rate is difficult at best. Also difficult to predict is the exact timing of production recoveries due to factors beyond our control such as when damaged pipelines will come back on line. At last week’s conference we took a stab at our estimated average 2008 production and came up with a range of 540,000 to 545,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. You can do the math to arrive at a fourth quarter estimate but I’ve got to tell you there is a lot going on here that has potential to impact fourth quarter volumes in either direction. Despite the short-term uncertainties, Apache’s financial condition and outlook are sound. In the face of changing global economic circumstances not only are we in a position to carry out our business strategy, Apache is well positioned to take advantage of the inevitable carnage that springs from adversity. We are by no means immune to substantially reduced oil and gas prices or the bleak world economy. However given our ways, we earlier took steps that put us in good stead relative to our competitors. Because we didn’t chase the upswing too hard and avoided outspending our cash flow, we’re among the fortunate few with access to capital at a reasonable cost. Our A- credit rating, which is ignored most of the time, has proven itself invaluable in accessing additional capital in today’s difficult environment. Debt, even taking into consideration the additional debt that came with the bond issuance, is a manageable 20% or so of our total capitalization and cash of around $2 billion is an opportunity fund. Our unused credit facility commitment totals $2.3 billion. It’s committed for the next four years and while you really don’t know until you test that or draw down from the banks which banks will fund and which banks won’t, I will tell you that our lead bank indicated recently that they have had draw downs literally thousands over the last month and there was only one bank that didn’t fund. It shouldn’t surprise you that was Lehman and they are not amongst our banks in our credit line. If you add the $2 billion and the $2+ billion of unused credit facilities, at least in theory we’ve got potential fire power or dry powder of some $4 billion. The final point I’d make is that there’s nothing like rising production to mitigate the impact of falling prices. Although we don’t yet know our capital expenditures or our precise production for ’09, it’s hard to imagine a scenario under which we would not grow production next year. These advantages give Apache an important leg up on our competition in terms of turning adversity to advantage, and while difficult times challenge every company Apache’s at its best in tough times such as the environment in which we find ourselves today.
Bob Dye: With that we’d be happy to open it up for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Tom Gardner - Simmons & Co.
Tom Gardner - Simmons & Co.: Steve, I appreciate your analyst conference last week and I appreciate you sharing your views on the M&A markets where you basically said that you thought things might get worse before they get better. Is there anything you’ve seen in the last week that might alter that view at all?
G. Steven Farris: I think it starts with the global economy and I’m certainly not an economist by any stretch of the imagination but I don’t see anything out there that leads you to believe that things are going to get better before they get worse. To me the real proof in the pudding is going to be what consumer spending’s going to be between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and I question whether or not we’re going to have any kind of robust consumer spending during that timeframe. But in terms of overall oil and gas, the only silver lining and it depends on where you’re coming from, frankly although it hurts our earnings and our cash flow things getting worse are not a bad thing for a while. Costs come down, rigs are laid down, people start paying real numbers for acreage rather than paying way too much for acreage. So in our business that’s not a big thing to put those costs on the books at a lower cost. Having said that, we have created a just-in-time inventory certainly in gas in this country if you just look at the type of things that are being drilled. But my question is, how long can you not drill before you start having a problem again?
Roger B. Plank: I’d mention too is when you live it you see it a little bit differently but in a capital intensive business like ours, it takes a while to put the brakes on capital programs because you make commitments in advance. So when cash flows drop rapidly with prices you really don’t see the damage for a quarter or two. So, unless you see some kind of snap back in prices which is highly unlikely at this point in time the chances are that it is the same as Steve indicated last week, it’s going to get worse before it gets better. A lot of those things don’t play through to company’s balance sheets for a quarter or two.
Tom Gardner - Simmons & Co.: Just jumping over to Egypt, you’ve had continued exploration success there, can you discuss your thoughts on the possibility of getting some extensions on those concessions lives, particularly in the Khalda area? If you were to enter negotiations would that diminish your current metrics?
G. Steven Farris: For those of you who may not be familiar, concession agreements have a term that is an exploration term and then you have a development lease and a big portion of Khalda is in a development lease which then has a term of 20 to 25 years. Our greater Khalda area doesn’t expire until 2023 and 2024. We renegotiated that back in 2005 and extended those concessions from 2010 and 2011 to 2023 and 2024. All of our other concessions in Egypt that are development leases have at least 20 years to run. So, from that standpoint we’re in pretty good shape. On the exploration side we have some exploration acreage that will start turning over in 2010 that we’re intent on over the next 18 months to work with the government to extend.
Tom Gardner - Simmons & Co.:  Just one last thought on the concession agreements, when they expire how is the equipment handled? Do they purchase it from you or is it just turned over to the government? What’s the compensation?
G. Steven Farris: Well, the way the concession agreement works is we basically have been repaid for all of the equipment that are associated with it through a cost recovery. So, it is basically after the cost recovery period legally the Egyptian government.
Operator:  Our question comes from David Tameron – Wachovia Securities.
David Tameron – Wachovia Securities: A couple of questions, Roger you referred to it briefly but the LOE, can you go through that again? You said you have $70 million deductable in the Gulf and you think that will be met by year end, is that what you said?
Roger B. Plank: Yes. We have to chew through our deductable before the insurance proceeds kick in so we’ll have a higher LOE per BOE cost than what would otherwise be the case until we get through that and that should happen right around year end, maybe it will trickle in to the first quarter in part but most of it will be behind us at year end. After that we’ve got sufficient insurance that any incremental costs would be covered by that so you wouldn’t see it in our numbers.
David Tameron – Wachovia Securities: What does that hit for the quarter? Does that hit in LOE?
Roger B. Plank: Well, I’m specifically addressing LOE.
David Tameron – Wachovia Securities: And that’s where the insurance deductible, that $70 million hit during the quarter.
Roger B. Plank: LOE, yes. What tends to happen is your LOE costs are the ones that you – you also have capital costs but those typically are later on so they get covered more by the insurance if you know what I’m saying. So yes, you’ll see it in the LOE.
David Tameron – Wachovia Securities: Then a question for Steve, you talked about the Eagleford and at the conference that was more focused on the oil side, can you talk about the potential on the gas side in that same property?
G. Steven Farris: In fact we’re drilling two wells that we think will be in the gas window as we speak. Certainly, if you move down to the gassier part of the Austin Chalk which many of you might have read, Petrohawks, now we’re quite a ways to the northeast of the Petrohawk acreage but there’s a high in between the two but both of them are over old Austin Chalk fields and they drilled in to gas window of the Austin Chalk and we’re drilling these two wells in the gas window of the Austin Chalk and we anticipate them being gassier.  Actually, we anticipate them being gas. Certainly gas can move through the shales a little bit easier than the oil. Although, I’ll be real honest with you, I’ve got to be careful, I really wasn’t expecting that kind of rate out of the Eagleford in the oil sites. 525 barrels a day if it will roll over will be very, very economic.
David Tameron – Wachovia Securities: When do you anticipate giving us an additional update on that?
G. Steven Farris: Well, we’ve got another well that we’re getting ready to frac. We’ve got four wells down with horizontals in them that we’re fracing. We just fraced a second well and we should have some results in the next month. It will take a month to understand the decline curve associates with this first well that we’re talking about.
David Tameron – Wachovia Securities: Then one last question, and I think it was Roger that mentioned it, you talked about fourth quarter volumes and you said that there’s a number of factors. Any other big factors besides the GOM and Australia, the timing of those two that we could look at in fourth quarter as far as the swing on the volume side?
Roger B. Plank: Those are the biggest although we also have late in the fourth quarter, 100 million a day net and 5,000 barrels a day net in Egypt that will begin to come on line so the timing of that could also impact.
David Tameron – Wachovia Securities: And you scheduled that for late 4Q?
Roger B. Plank: Right.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs: One quick question, any update on the Australia gas contract, my apologies if you mentioned it earlier.
G. Steven Farris: No, other than that we’re continuing to noodle very small points Brian.
Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs: In Egypt, I guess any signs, maybe it’s a little early but can you talk about anything you may be seeing in terms of gas demand and any implications from a potential decrease in economic growth there and what that means for your ability to extract additional price increases there?
G. Steven Farris: I think we showed a chart at our analyst conference on terms of the growth rate in Egypt, what it’s been domestically. It’s significant, if you look at that chart, look on our website, the last three or four years it’s been about a 22% and they have targeted natural gas to back out oil so I don’t see that diminishing.  The one thing I will say is that not unlike any other country of the world, Egypt watches what happens to natural gas in this country. At current prices the ability to set down and talk about meaningful price increases when you got a NYMEX where it is priced today is going to be more difficult when it was at $9.  Having said that I think over time for two reasons, one is they have to have investment for natural gas and they have to have infrastructure which we have been doing both. And, the need that they have I think over time that will happen. I just think what is happening in this country has an impact on what is happening in Egypt.
Roger B. Plank: The one thing I would say, you may have noticed in our numbers in the blast packs that our average price in Egypt was $5.62 for the quarter. So, we tend to talk about most of our gas which is capped at $2.65 but we also have an old, I think we’re the only company with an old sort of legacy contract that is tied to crude oil that has dragged that price up. So, Steve’s point about prices coming down, all of a sudden that $5 gas looks more attractive.
G. Steven Farris: The thing is we’ve got to be careful, we’re going to start diluting that as we come on with our [Crawford] gas because that’s 100 million a day contract and if we go up to $7.50 on gas all of a sudden you’ve got $6.50 at $2.65 against that prices versus what you’ve got today which is about $3.50 versus that price, $4.50 versus that price so you’re going to start diluting that contract. That contract is until 2013, that existing contract that we have.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets.
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: A quick question on your Egyptian gas lines this quarter, it looks like you guys posted a pretty healthy increase. It is my understanding that you didn’t have your [inaudible] plant coming on for a while, just curious as to why you had the nice pop in the Egyptian gas here in 3Q. 
G. Steven Farris: Well, specifically what has happened is that we’re starting to put more gas – part of our gas takeaway is going through the Obaiyed plant which is a Shell plant and that Shell plant we have the ability to produce 150 million a day until they get some work done and then we can go to 210. What’s happened is Shell’s production is falling off so we’re getting a bigger share of that plant than what we anticipated. We have had hot days of over 200 million a day going through the Obaiyed plant. 
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: Jumping over in to Canada real quick, your gas volumes have been declining pretty steadily over there. Do you guys have any sense of when you think that will kind of turn around and flatten out and maybe start growing kind of what point in time you think that can happen?
G. Steven Farris: I’m pretty encouraged given the amount of capital we put in Canada, our ability to keep that relatively flat frankly. The other thing you’ve got to keep in mind is that in the second quarter we sold about 15 million a day net of Canadian gas so you’ve got to be careful when you compare quarter-to-quarters.  What’s happen with Alberta with respect to the royalty our big growth in Canada is going to be from our Utla play over time. In fact, if you wanted to be very optimistic over the next four or five years the Utla play net to Apache could be the same as what we are producing today. We’re producing about 25 million a day right now. Our plans for the winter right now with our partner is to drill a multiple of the wells that we’ve drilled in the past and we’ll have the capacity to take that gas out of there also so that ought to help our production going in to next year.
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: Then you’ll start to see some impact once we get in to spring of next year from increased Utla?
G. Steven Farris: Probably spring and fall because what we’ll do is drill those wells in winter and actually frac them and hook them up later in the spring/summer time frame.
Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: And what’s your capacity up there out of Utla in terms of your net share? 
G. Steven Farris: Well, our capacity right now is about 25 million a day which we will be working on this winter and increase that significantly.
Operator:  Our next question comes from David Heikkinen- Tudor Pickering Holt.
David Heikkinen- Tudor Pickering Holt: Just a question about Argentina and any thoughts around the pension plan nationalization and kind of the moves there relative the thoughts at the analyst meeting of being able to increase pricing over the long term?
G. Steven Farris: I think you’re seeing an administration that is trying to sure up their financial position. I don’t know what the out crop is. I know we have a number of Argentine employees that were pretty long faced when they heard that news. The fundamental problem in Argentina if you take out the things that go back and forth with respect to different laws and stuff and unions, etc. they have a fundamental problem with meeting demand, whether it’s on the crude side or the gas side. Again, I would refer you to our website but now their supply is less than their demand and they’re having to import LNG or use diesel or make propane natural gas by putting air in it. What they’ve done is come up with a program that is called gas plus that basically allows you to contract directly with a supplier at whatever price the market will bear. Part of our program for the first part of next year – right now actually and the first part of next year is going to be drilling those gas wells in the [nic] and to test the resolves of the government to actually make that work. I mean there is a law in place and the only time you will know whether or not that is really going to stick is when they get in to the winter months which is our summer months and they need gas whether or not they’re going to redirect that gas in to the residential market. But, I think fundamentally things have to change there.
David Heikkinen- Tudor Pickering Holt: How do you internally assess risk of nationalization?
G. Steven Farris: I have very little concern about a true nationalization in Argentina and the reason is they don’t – I don’t know what they’d use for money to invest in order to do anything different than anybody else does. What you really continue to be concerned about is they have an export price on oil, they depressed the price of natural gas and what happens is they bleed you to death if you know what I’m saying. But, in terms of actually walking in and nationalizing I think that would be – obviously, they could do anything, they’re the government but I don’t think it’s in their best interest to do that, if you just look at it purely from a self interest standpoint.
Roger B. Plank: One thing it took me years to figure out that’s so obvious now that I look back is if you think about nationalizing where that’s happened in the past is where a country is exporting and getting all sorts of cash over and above what’s being invested in the country. A country that doesn’t have enough energy in and of itself and doesn’t have the cash to invest, there’s a symbiotic relationship there, they need capital and if they had excess oil and were exporting oil they wouldn’t need it. So, it’s a lot harder to say, “Get lost.” Because, what are they going to do for money.
Operator:  At this time with no further questions from the audience I’d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Dye for any closing or additional remarks.
Robert J. Dye: Thank you very much for listening in and if anybody needs me after the call I’ll be in my office.
Operator:  That does conclude today’s presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Apache Corporation's Second Quarter Earnings 2008 Conference Call. This call is being recorded. Today's presentation will be hosted by Mr. Bob Dye, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr Dye, please go ahead sir.
Bob Dye - Vice President of Investor Relations: Thank you for joining us today. This morning Apache Corporation released second quarter 2008 results, which totaled net income of $1.4 billion or $4.28 per diluted share and cash flow of $2.3 billion, which were both all-time records. Today’s discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions and no assurance can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located on our website. In addition, any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations, or cost incurred will be identified as such with the reconciliation again located on our website at www.apachecorp.com. Steve Farris, our CEO, and Roger Plank, our CFO, will now make prepared remarks prior to taking questions. And, with that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Farris - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us for Apache’s second quarter earnings conference call. Our second quarter was marked by record financial results, continued explorations success, and sustained progress in delivering on our pipeline of development projects. As Bob pointed out, we achieved record financial results for the quarter with $4.28 per diluted share of earnings and cash from operations of $2.3 billion for the quarter. Not only did we exceed $4 per share of earnings for the first time, but we exceeded our highest previous total by over $1 per share. Cash flow of $2.3 billion exceeded the previous record set in the fourth quarter of 2007 by over $400 million. Our exploration achievements during the quarter again reflected our ability to identify and control profitable opportunities and build value for our shareholders. And I would like to just give you a few highlights. In the Gulf of Mexico, the US made major discovery at the Gulf of 1X, which holds an estimate recoverable reserves of 100 BCF, we don’t operate -- we have a 40% non-operated interest. In Egypt, the Heqet-2, which is located in the western part of the Greater Khalda tested 2,100 barrels a day from a deep horizon and that opens up a new play potential, which potentially could extend hundreds of square miles primarily on our acreage. Also in Egypt, we achieved 4,300 barrels a day of production from a new well in the Umbarka field in the Greater Khalda area and have identified a new water flood project in East Bahariya concessions in (inaudible) Basin. In Canada, new drilling results by our partner and our Ootla shale play further supports our estimated 9 to 16 TCF of net recoverable reserves to Apache. In the North Sea, we have five new wells in the Forties Field that have aggregated 8,900 barrels a day during the quarter and I will point out that all of those wells that I just mentioned will contribute to the second half production. On the development side, we made progress on our pipeline of several new projects, which continue on track to add 135,000 barrels a day over the next four years and I would like to just mention too our Egyptian water flood project is already ramping up, we have increased production output and shipped two days production output increase over the next several years. Second, our new natural gas processes plants in the Khalda area of Egypt are on track to begin commissioning in October and should contribute an additional net production of 100 million a day and about 5,000 barrels of liquids a day by the end of the year. I might point out that by the end of the year we should nearly double our gas production in Egypt to over 750 million a day. So far, we have not added our Ootla play to our pipeline potential because we are still scoping the capacity and the timing of getting that on. Our daily production for the quarter was down 1% from the first quarter of 2008 and primarily due to two non-recurrent events. First in the North Sea, we were impacted by the maintenance turnaround and refinery strike that we have no commercial interest in I might say that reduced oil production by 5,150 barrels a day for the quarter. Secondly, we had a pipeline explosion in Australia on the June 3rd and caused us to shut in all of our production at Varanus Island and this incident alone reduced natural gas volumes by 60 million a day and oil volumes by 1,900 barrels a day during the quarter and that will impact us during the second half of 2008. And once again, I would like to say we would like to assure the citizens of Western Australia that we fully understand the hardship that they have experienced. It will continue to commend our highest priority until production is fully restored. We will bring every consumable resource there to restore production as quickly and as safely as possible, and I am pleased to announce that we are ahead of schedule on expect to commence production over the next few days at an initial rate of 110 million cubic feet of gas a day and by the latter part of August we expect to increase production we should double that to about 220 million a day. The remaining gross production volumes of about 95 million a day should be restored by year end and this volume is associated with Harriet joint venture facility that was directly adjacent to the explosion and will require more significant repairs. We expect net production to average roughly 65 million a day and 7,000 barrels a day of oil in Australia in the third quarter of 2008 before returning to full volumes by the end of the year. I might point out that the Van Gogh, Pyrenees, Reindeer and Julimar development projects also in Australia are not associated with Varanus Island and the incident will not delay our timetable of full production on any of those projects. Despite the non-recurring events in Australia and the North Sea, we still expect production to increase in 2008 around 2% relative to 2007 that is provided we meet our timetable for restoring production of doing the filing. I might note that our income on our cash flow generation remains remarkably strong and although these events affected our current production profile, they have no impact on our ultimate reserve. Our long-term outlook hasn't changed. Frankly it's never been better. Driven by successful drilling programs and a very strong development pipeline, we are confident that Apache is entering into a period of accelerating production growth 2009, 2012. We do intend to give an outline of our production growth at our Analyst Meeting that we are going to hold in Houston on October 23rd and I would invite all of you to join us. I'd like to go over a few regional highlights now with you. In Australia, which I've covered most of the major projects I'd like to go over some of our major development projects. Van Gogh oil development remains on track for first production in mid 2009. That should bring on about 20,000 barrels a day net to Apache. The Pyrenees development which is operated by BHP will most likely come on strain at the end of 2009 or the first part of 2010 and that will be an additional 20,000 barrels a day net to Apache. Our Reindeer gas development is on track from mid 2010 with the start up of 60 million a day net and we are closing in on our refining our initial gas sales contract. In fact we have an all hands on deck meeting scheduled in Perth tomorrow to walk through the remaining issues. We continue to study options for marketing and developing our Julimar gas area. First production is scheduled for 2011, 2012, delivering the gas (inaudible) into the domestic Western Australia market or into an international markets. During the first quarter we made a nice discovery called Halyard that was tested at 68 million a day. We received governmental approval on the Halyard field in the second quarter this year. Actually that's only 90 days from the discovery date. We are working to establish first production by 2010. In addition to our activities in the Carnarvon basin we have an expiration program that is said to begin around the end of the third quarter in the Gibson Basin. And all total Australia will be a large and important growth driver for the company for many years mainly driven by the materiality and debt of our exploration and project portfolio. In Canada, we drilled 176 wells in the first half of 2008. We intend to accelerate activity in the second half of 2008. We plan to drill 415 wells in our shallow gas area of Alberta and drill 46 deeper wells for the Kaybob. We also planned 24 wells at House Mountain, but the big story in Canada continues to be our most Muskwa Shale play in a new area of Northeastern BC. Apache has a 50% interest and operates approximately one half of the over 400,000 gross acres that we have in this play. In April we announced the results of three horizontal wells we had drilled during the first quarter. We have 24 hour test rates of 5.3, 6.1 and 8.8 million cubic feet of gas a day respectively. EnCana our 50/50 partner has also drilled three wells this past winter. They have recently completed tested and hooked up two of those wells and which are now currently flowing to Apache's missile gas plant. The average production rate for the both those wells individually both those wells after the first 30 day was about 5 million a day and yesterday's rate were about 4.5 and 4.3 million cubic feet of gas a day. We estimate our net reserve potential to Apache in this play to be 9 to 16 TCF of gas reserves and for reference a worldwide proven gas reserves at the end of 2007 totaled 7.8 TCF. We have yet to finalize our 2008, 2009 winter growing program and infrastructure at Ootla, but I anticipate a step change in the activity level this coming winter. Ootla has the potential to not only be one of the key growth place in North America but also a major driver for growth for Apache over the next several years. We anticipate significant volumes coming from this area in 2011, 2012 timeframe. I should also note that we closed a minor asset sale in Canada at the end of the first quarter that was about 12 million a day affecting our production. In Egypt our diversified portfolio across several basins continued to yield drilling successes during the quarter and I would like to cover four highlights. The first one is Bahariya concessions we operate and own a 100%. The C1X well tested 584 barrels a day before [refract] from 45 feet of pay in a 1400 acre closure. We will refract that well as soon as we get governmental approval for development lease and we would expect like all the other wells in that area that we make over 1000 barrels a day and we appear to have discovered another water flood opportunity similar to the five other fields we are currently developing in this concession. And for reference point, we are currently producing gross production from the concession primarily from water floods of over 27,000 barrels a day. Second, also in the (inaudible) basin, but this is in the NEAG Concession that we have a 48% interest in and shale operates, we drilled two good development wells in the JG field and those are expected to come on momentarily at 1500 to 2000 barrels a day. I would like to move over to the western edge of the greater Khalda area and that area is called a Faghur Basin. We drilled and fract the well called Heqet-2 which tested 2100 barrels a day from the Jurassic lower Safa at 14,700 feet. This is unexpected depth and horizon to find oil instead of natural gas and Faghur basin is cooler than the Shushan Basin where a cost of discovery is. We (inaudible) stimulated this Heqet-2 with excellent results and we potentially have several hundred square miles of fairway that may lend similar opportunities mostly already on our concession. Finally we drilled an outstanding development well in the Umbarka field in North Central portion of the greater Khalda area that Umbarka-174, tested 4300 barrels a day and remained AEB field play and Umbarka is one of the eight different fields in Egypt presently underwater flood. On the development side in Egypt as I mention earlier we are looking forward to increase our gas volumes from the Salam plant expansion project in the Khalda area during the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, to this capacity we've also had capacity increase with the Salam plant. We have also been increasing volumes through that or buy its plant. We began the year averaging 160 million cubic feet of gas a day. We have gradually increased that over 180 million a day with additional processing available. In the fourth quarter we expect our throughput to increase to 210 million a day as shale increases their compression capacity at the plant. On the water flood activity side, continues to post gratifying results, in aggregate during the quarter we drilled 43 wells water flood wells and eight separate projects. Quarter-to-quarter gross oil production increased 5% to 44,700 barrels a day and we are now injecting 61,000 barrels a day. With the combination of our large and diverse exploration portfolio and our low risk development there is no doubt that Egypt's growth will continue for many years. I'd like to turn now to the North Sea. Production average for the quarter of 56,570 barrels a day, in this slide that we pointed out earlier, maintenance turnaround on a strike at Grangemouth, Scotland refinery that negatively impact our production by over 5,000 barrels a day for the quarter. At the refinery strike caused the Forties pipeline system to shut in, which in turn caused Apache to shut in its Forties field. I might point out we do not own an interest in the Forties pipeline system or the Grangemouth refinery. Drilling results have been excellent this year in North Sea, five successful wells have been drilled and that aggregate produced 8900 barrels a day for the second quarter. Since the strike, fuel production has averaged over 63,000 barrels a day, which makes us optimistic that volumes in the second half of 2008 should be relatively strong to the 56,000 barrels a day we averaged in the second quarter. Turning to Argentina, in the first half of 2008 we drilled 33 new wells. We had an 88% success rate and we have six drilling rigs working in [American] and 2 working in Tierra del Fuego. During the quarter we finished acquiring a 522 square kilometer 3D survey at Lago Fuego in the Southern part of Tierra del Fuego. That shoot as well as our earlier 2000 square kilometer survey completed during the first quarter has truly provided us a very large inventory of drilling opportunities. In fact we intend to pick up a third rig in Tierra del Fuego in the third quarter. In the [Nakkin] basin we are developing shallow oil play which is present many of our producing and shut in wells in the heart of the basin. Shallow zone we have tested up to 150 barrel a day and appeared be present over a fairly large area. We are actively evaluating recompilation in drilling locations in that play. Finally in Argentina you may have seen as now received our first coal load, ship load of LNG which is being a land at a price of 16 to $20 an Mcf which really underscores the fundamentals we are providing upside to our realization in our returns. In the central region of the US we have 25 drilling rigs working during the quarter. We spotted 148 operated wells. We had a 99% success rate on 124 that we actually got down and I'd like to mention two of our highlights in the central region. In the Permian basin on the properties we acquired for last year, we drilled 13 successful well during the quarter which triple the pre drill expectations really due to the completion techniques developed through Apache expertise elsewhere in the Permian. The acquired properties are currently producing at a gross rate of about 11,300 barrels a day which is a 10% increase since the acquisition last year. Secondly our positive momentum at Stiles Ranch (inaudible) natural gas play in the Texas Panhandle continued during the quarter with production now over 70 million a day. We control 38,000 gross acres in this play which is up from 10,000 gross acres we had at the beginning of the year. And we have recently doubled the number of rigs we are drilling at Stiles Ranch say. Turning to US Gulf Coast, we average 18 operated rigs during the quarter which included nine jack-up and one semi. We also have two platforms rigs and a couple of barge rigs as well as four land rigs running. The big news in this region during the quarter is obviously our goal for 1X discovery in 2700 feet of water at [Garden Banks] 462. We obtained that lease in 2004 and our technical team developed the go for prospect late last year. Regrettably we were faced with a lease deadline late in 2007 so we found a partner Mariner Energy who had the floater rig and the equipment window required for exploration and a quick development. We estimate the discovery contains about 100 Bcf of gross recoverable reserves and we are hopeful to initiate production of over 100 million a day by year-end using a subsea tie-back development. As I pointed out earlier we have 40% interest. We also have a second well currently drilling on that block. One more highlight in the region I'd like to point out which is that our Union Bank 26 that we own 100% on we completed our fourth well sense fourth quarter of 2007 which is increased field production from only 700 barrels a day at the beginning of the year to over 4800 barrels a day. We have one well that is currently drilling and we have eight wells in eight locations remaining in our inventory. And I hope you can see we've had excellent results from our drilling in the Gulf region. And summing up, I would like to make a few comments. We take stock of the second quarter as being yet another period of outstanding growth rate success for Apache. With 14 million acres across our diverse areas of operations around the world we continue to identify high profitable exploration, exploitation opportunities from the US, Gulf to Egypt from British Columbia to Australia. Our drilling achievements during the second quarter across all of these regions have moved this strategy another step forward. In addition we have net production of 135,000 barrels equivalent coming on from our seven major development projects and we are working to add the Ootla Shale Gas Play in Canada as the eight and potentially largest major project in this pipeline, which extends our visible growth far out in the future. We obviously contend to be optimistic about the fort momentum of Apache. Roger?
Roger B. Plank - Chief Financial Officer:  Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. What a quarter. Apache turned in outstanding financial results that eclipsed all prior record as well as consensus of expectations despite our production challenges during the quarter. This obviously, speaks to the impact of substantially higher prices, but it also speaks to the effectiveness of Apache's balance portfolio approach that we could absorb both the pipeline explosion in Australia and a strike shutting down at Forties filed, our largest field and still have the rest of our portfolios production carry the day and enable our best quarter ever. Oil and gas revenues climb $1.5 billion to a record $3.9 billion from second quarter of '07. $1.1 billion of the increase came from oil alone, another pleasant reminder of the benefit of Apache's balance production mix, which remains around half oil and half gas. Over one third of these revenues made it to the bottom line as earnings more than doubled to $1.4 billion from the same period last year and humbly are paced our previous best quarter by 370 million. As Bob and Steve mentioned, earnings per share of $4.28 were also a record beating our previous record by over a third. Cash flow of $2.3 billion exceeded second quarter a year ago by $853 million and bested a former high by $400 million. Apache's record profits yielded exceptional returns. Second quarter annualized return on capital employ average 29%. Return on equity was 35%. Turning to detailed comparisons of second quarter versus the first quarter of '08, our oil realization rose 21.07 or 24% from the first quarter, while gas realizations rose $1.67 per Mcf or 26% driving up oil and gas revenues by 726 million or 23%. I want to take a moment to remind everyone of the impact that higher prices have on production volumes in countries with PSCs and cost recovery mechanisms. Basically the higher the price the fewer the barrels needed to recover cost. So higher prices are a bit of a double edge sword benefiting revenues and profits, but hurting production volumes. In Egypt we estimated a $10 per barrel increase in price reduces our volumes by approximately 2200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And with Egyptian oil price up $28 a barrel over the first quarter, oil production was reduced by an estimated 6100 barrels of equivalent oil per day or just over 1% of our worldwide volumes. So that's another factor we considered in looking at our year-over-year production growth. Earnings increased 42% or $424 million and cash flow increased 26% or $475 million from the first quarter. While the (inaudible) incident reduced production by 2% in the quarter, the earnings impact was a negligible $0.03 per share primarily because at present anyway Australian gas is some of our lowest price gas. The real story for the quarter is the increase in our margins. While oil and gas prices increased 24% on average, our cash cost increase just 6% while our non-cash cost rose only 2%. This means the substantial portion of the increased revenue from the strong commodity prices was captured in our profitability. Cash margins increased 30% sequentially to $59.71 per barrel of oil equivalent. Including DD&A our total pre tax margin increased 41% to $46.69 per barrel equivalent produced. These margins are over 30% ahead of our best quarter ever. It's interesting to note, if you remove the effect of taxes other than income, which are essential price sensitive, production taxes from our cash cost, our remaining controllable cost actually decreased 2% from the first quarter. Now turning to cost in a bit more detail, lifting cost per BOE decreased 1% to $8.90. Efforts to hold the line on absolute cost are bearing fruit and as production grows in the second half LOE per unit produced should drop somewhat. Full cost DD&A increased 2% sequentially to $11.77 per BOE consistent with recent drilling cost being higher than our historical average. G&A cost decreased a nickel to a $1.57 per BOE. Absolute costs were down. The result of lower second quarter payroll burns such as FICA taxes which peak in the first quarter with incentive compensation payments. Rising production should enable our future rate to fall below $1.50 per BOE. Taxes other than income in total increased $1.17 to $5.95 per BOE on higher commodity prices. The increase was primarily related to North Sea PRT with the substantial increase in oil price drove a 34% increase in tax. Finance expense decreased $0.09 to $0.78 per BOE on lower average debt balances. Turning to income taxes; our second quarter '08 effective tax rate of 38% compare to 39% in the first quarter. Strong commodity prices significantly increased current taxable income again this quarter pushing the current portion of our tax to 78% from 75% in the first quarter. The problem with making the money is you have to pay more taxes and we are certainly doing our part on that regard. Given current commodity prices, we presently expect the deferred tax percentage in the 25 to 30% range for the year and 38 to 40% effective tax rate, absent the unforeseen such as foreign exchange movement from here on out. For those that may think that our industry doesn't pay enough tax and that they seem to be growing their number on a daily basis, I will point out that Apache anticipates paying some $1.7 billion of cash tax on income and production-related revenues for the first half of the year. At current commodity prices, the total cash tax for the year could exceed $3.5 billion, of which over $1 billion is a special non-income production tax reserved exclusively for extractive industries of which oil and gas is the largest. Summing things up, Apache's outstanding second quarter results were underpinned by our portfolio approach, which has served us well in periods of rising costs and unprecedented commodity prices is also proving to be just as valuable amidst today's highly turbulent markets. Our balance of crude oil versus natural gas, geographical diversity, mix of long life matured developments versus high risk, higher reward projects, and strong financial position are all designed to comprise an all weather strategy. Our founder occasionally notes that ancient mariners navigated off distant stars in order to avoid being blown off course by whatever ways immediately came front of them. Similarly, we charged to execute on our growing backlog of E&D projects around the world in order to continue delivering consistent profitable growth, despite short term challenges. Before closing, I wanted to underscore key points of our growth. As was the case last year when most all our production growth occurred in the second half, we anticipate another very strong second half this year and you can do the math, but achieving growth in 2008 entails a substantial ramp up between now and year end. So when we talk about growing production up to 2% for the year, we are planning on significant growth by year-end that will carry into the future. Bob?
Bob Dye - Vice President of Investor Relations: We are ready to take questions at this time.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And we will take our first question from Tom Gardner at Simmons & Company.
Tom Gardner: Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Steven Farris: Hey Tom.
Tom Gardner: A couple of questions on your emerging developments, first in Egypt. With reference to your high grade oil wells, how should we think about this opportunity, how would you characterize it as -- would it be an unconventional?
Steven Farris: Do you mean in our Heqet area, Tom?
John Crum: The deep oil completion we made.
Tom Gardner: Yeah.
Steven Farris: Yeah, the Heqet area is kind of in the South Western quarter of -- obviously a huge acreage in our Khalda concession. Many years ago the Heqet -- the first well was actually drilled in 1991, the Heqet-1 and at that time we didn’t really bring frac equipment into Egypt until about 1997. So this was the first time we had fraced one of those deep Lower Safa zones in that well. We have a number (inaudible) of months through there and I can't tell you all of those are going to be good, but we are going to drill four wildcats in that area here in the coming months. We think because it is a cruder basin that we have potential to add significant low reserves down there.
Tom Gardner: Okay. Any characterization of how big the opportunity set could be beyond this field? I mean it just, I guess it's…?
Steven Farris: I think it's probably a little premature. We are going to get -- we are actually going to recomplete two of our earlier wells drilled. We drilled some wells down there from 1991 through about 1996, and it probably be just speculation at the present time.
Tom Gardner: Okay. Well, moving on to Canada and it looks like the major pipeline infrastructure appears to be targeted for 2011 or 2012. Can you talk about what's the plan capacity? There's been -- these discussions would be for that optic capacity?
Steven Farris: Well, that is a moving kind of unfolding event. One major pipelines up there is talking to us about not only for us but for other players out there. Actually (inaudible) that area, which create significant takeaway capacity. I think in the end, our largest investment will be in plants because I think over time there will be major pipelines that come up there and take that gas. Right now we probably have -- if we have the plant capacity, we probably could take over 400 million a day out of there, gross out of that Ootla area. Ourselves and our partners in Canada plus the other players up there, you can see a time when 400 million a day is not going to be enough.
Tom Gardner: That's significantly liquids production with the gas?
Steven Farris: No, it's pretty dry.
Tom Gardner: Pretty dry, okay. Thank you gentlemen.
Steven Farris: Thank you.
Operator: And we will go next to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer: Thank you. Good afternoon.
Steven Farris: Good afternoon Brian.
Brian Singer: Picking up on the end of some of the comments made on the second half production, I think depending on how you are calculating the 2%, it look like you have to get to about 590,000 BOE a day in the second half to get to that 2%. And I was wondering what you are assuming in terms of contribution from additional gas in Egypt from the Salam plant in your numbers?
Steven Farris: Well, we should -- actually we should be commissioning that in about the middle of September. And I think right now we are going to be ramping up I think the first -- October will be the first of any meaningful probably gross about 15 million a day. That's gross. And then we would ramp up another actually by the end of the year, we would be up almost to the 200 million a day and about 5,000 barrels of liquid.
Brian Singer: Thank you.
Steven Farris: And we take about half of that, I guess.
Brian Singer: Okay. You mentioned that you are looking at international markets for Australian gas. I know this has come up before and you discussed that upfront. Are there any new thoughts on how actively you consider participating in LNG development and the timeline for that?
Steven Farris: Well, I think if you look at the infrastructure going in an immediate area to where our discoveries are, you can understand why that may be an alternative. Certainly we've had discussions -- ongoing discussions along those lines, but we don't have anything to report at the present time.
Brian Singer: Okay. Also on the international gas front, any changes on the Egypt side? I think at the time of your last call, you were about ready to potentially bring the topic up and I was wondering what the latest on the consideration for higher gas prices if you build additional process and capacity?
Steven Farris: We have made a proposal to EGPC and also to the Petroleum Minister on our concession called the up to the North, [Heqet] concession, the Heqet discovery that we made. We made a presentation to them on a higher gas price. It's interesting. I just read a thing out of the Egyptian paper that the Egyptians are working to incentivize foreign contractors to increase activity, which is going to require cost prices in Egypt to go up. So I think we are beginning to see some traction in that area.
Brian Singer: Where do you think they could go?
Steven Farris: I don't have a timeline in that area. We made a proposal that was pretty aggressive. If we get half of what our proposal is we are probably going to be lucky. Now the one thing I would say in Egypt because I think some -- we don’t do a very good at explaining it. We have one portion of our gas that have 100 million a day gross is 50 million a day net that actually sells for about $15 an M because it wasn't capped back in 2001. So our average gas plays in the second quarter was much higher than the July gas plays of 2.65 plus BTUs. We actually average $6.25 per quarter.
Analyst: Great. And if I can just one more. When you look at where oil prices are and also where some of the international gas prices are and free cash flow that you are and are likely to continue to generate, any thoughts on the acquisition market, other international gas markets potentially or bulking upon North American oil?
Steve Farris: The one thing, I mean, Apache's 52 year history, we are an inquisitive company and we haven't stopped being an inquisitive. But right now it's very difficult to make things, make sense economically. We continue to look, but we continue to drill wells, which we have a tremendous opportunity to grow this company with the drill bit right now.
Analyst: Thank you.
Bob Dye: Thanks Brian.
Operator: And we will go next to Gil Yang with Citi Investment.
Gil Yang: Good afternoon. Could you make a comment on why there was a sequential drop, maybe you mentioned this earlier, but why was there a sequential drop in the Argentine gas price versus the first quarter?
Steve Farris: It's we are going through the winter. In Argentina, it's just the opposite of where we are here. I mean, in fact, it's cold there right now. I just got back from Argentina a week ago and it was about 37 degrees in the evening. So they use an awful lot of gas during the winter and what happens is the residential uses a lot of gas and because of the tiered approach that they have to gas down there, you get about $0.50 for your residential price and they redirect gas to the residential market in the winter. So you will see until they change their pricing, you will see that counter cyclic go through the United States and turn the prices in Argentina. The one thing I might point out is yesterday, Argentina just announced that they are going to increase electricity prices and that’s not natural gas prices yet, but there is a real anticipation that natural gas prices will be right behind them.
Roger Plank: To get an appreciation that Argentina is headed in the right direction with gas prices, even with this sort of winter effect, the price of $1.39 we averaged in the second quarter compared to $1.02 a year before. So we aren't making headway.
Gil Yang: Well, last year you didn’t seem to have as much of an effect maybe on region certainly, you didn’t seem to have a much winter effect on pricing, is that because of the industrial and the residential prices were more similar then?
Roger Plank: Probably and yeah, so you won't see -- okay, go ahead.
John Crum: We also lost a Methanex contract in TdF that we were abrogated, so that was a higher price contract than our average as well, Gil.
Gil Yang: When was that?
John Crum: Last year. That's on a suspended exports from TdF.
Steve Farris:  John, I don’t know if maybe we didn’t explain ourselves. Roger pointed out that at end of June of 2007, our average price was $1.02 and the average price at the end -- for the second quarter of 2008 was $1.39. So we increased about $0.37.
Roger Plank: 36%.
Steve Farris: Yeah, 36% from last year. And I am optimistic because one of the reasons I just got back from there and talked to a number of people. I think you are going to see -- we talked to the Finance Minister and my expectation obviously is not going to look like him, but we are going to start seeing gas prices start trend upwards there.
Gil Yang: Okay. And related to that, when you look at in a broader sense, when you look at capital allocation for all the different projects you have got and you look at Argentina versus Ootla versus Australia, are the investments in Argentina, are they economic at the current prices of oil and gas that you are selling or are you really the loss leader for the anticipation that prices will rise at some point in the future? And then with Ootla, how do the returns fit into the overall portfolio of return you have got on your different projects?
Steven Farris:  Okay. With respect to Argentina, we don't drill wells at lost leaders. Every well that we drill makes economics at a price scenario that is under the current environment. It's interesting that we can find a lot of hydrocarbon. In fact, my message even to the government down there was that the Argentina has a lot of hydrocarbon. What they need is a little bit different pricing regime and they would have a lot more activity down there than they get today and that provides jobs and a lot of other things besides the product itself. So we don't - we make economics on the wells that we drill under our current price scenario. With respect to Ootla, I think we had a presentation after we drilled our three wells and tested them and actually publicly showed the results of those, and it's 4 BCF. At $8 an acre we were making about 13% rate of return. If you get to 5 BCF it goes up and obviously it goes up exponentially at 6 BCF. So far we are -- and that was using $10 million per well to drill those wells. What we found and I think what we are going to continue to find is that we are not going to spend $10 million to drill and test those wells. And the other thing is I think over time you are going to see the reserves trend toward the upper number. If you look at the wells that EnCana drilled and they put 10 fracs on those wells, we put 6 to 8 fracs on our wells. They fracs them larger and if you just look at the early returns out of the EnCana wells, they are going to do better than our wells, which you would expect and you would also expect those two wells to be in the higher end of that reserve number that I gave you.
Roger Plank: One of the -- going back to the no lost leader in Argentina thing, one of the things that's also going on down there is the way that market is currently structured, we have to deliver basically a relatively fixed volume of gas into that residential market. So once you get above that allocation by the government that you deliver into it, then you can sell your incremental gas at what the market will bear and that's been 2.5 to $3.5 per MCF when you don't have winter iterations going on. But the point is the more incremental gas we bring on, the higher percentage of our gas will be sold at a more market sensitive price.
Analyst: Got you. Okay, thank you.
Operator:  And we will go next to David Tameron with Wachovia.
David Tameron : Hi good afternoon. Question, going back to Argentina one more time, and I apologize if you mentioned this. You were talking about at some point doing a 3D seismic shoot, I think it was going to be done this summer. Did that get done and if so any color from that?
Steven Farris: We were -- I think what you are referring to is our shoot down in Tierra del Fuego. We have now shot about 2,500 square kilometers of 3D seismic down there, the latest of which was the Lago Feugo shoot, which was 520 square kilometers. In fact, spot price is in charge of Argentina and Australia. We both went down. I am very, very optimistic about the ability to find things from that 3D shoot and on some exploration stuff number of prospects and we are also adding a rig in the third quarter to take advantage of that.
David Tameron : Okay. So that rig is going to drill some of the -- is it going to drill these prospects that were just identified?
Steven Farris: You bet.
David Tameron : Okay. And you kind of talked about it, but pipeline issues coming out of Tierra del Fuego, where those currently stand or you had some pipeline takeaway capacity issues?
Steven Farris: We have two problems with pipelines, one is there is not enough capacity. The other one is that we are at the tail end of that pipe and what happens is a couple of Petrobas and Totale inject into that pipe on the mainland and changed the pressure regime down to our end. There is more than just a passing fancy to build a loop line. In fact we talked about it when we were down there. They've ordered the steel. The government sanction pipe that will take another 250 million a day by the middle of 2009 of what they are advertising. Take another 250 million a day out of Tierra del Fuego. So hopefully in the next year or year-and-a-half we'll have excess capacity coming out of Tierra del Fuego and then they have a longer term plan to move that up to about 550 million a day by 2011.
David Tameron : Okay. But just going back 12 months, 250 shouldn't be - that should be more than enough for what you have in Totale and Petrobras, correct? You have excess capacity once that starts up?
Steve Farris: As long as we don't get the pressures regime problems that we get off of the mainland.
David Tameron : All right. And then another question and I don't know if this is for Bob or whom, but you mentioned the 2% growth target. You mentioned the assumptions for Salam to come back on line. Assuming if Australia come back online. Any other big project start ups that are needed in order to hit that target?
Steven Farris: No. The two big obviously are hitting our timelines on bringing to Salam and also hitting our timelines of bringing gas on in the Egypt.
David Tameron : Okay.
Roger Plank: You'll also get a pretty good uptick from the North Sea. We average about 55 to 56,000 barrels a day in the first half, and we've been averaging a fair amount higher than that since the strike ended. So I would anticipate that that will be a pretty good operation as well.
David Tameron : All right. Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: And we will go next to David Heikkinen with Tudor Pickering Holt.
David Heikkinen: Okay. Just a couple of questions on Egypt, the Heqet discovery described as 835 acres on that structure, trying to get an idea of the scope and size of these, can you give us net feet of pay or resource potential for that?
Steven Farris: Well, it's a little early to give a resource potential. We had about 40 feet of pay in that zone, which we fracked and the most interesting thing about it frankly is that we drilled other wells in that area both sides of that big east west [pool]. And all of those wells have the potential to be fracked but have never been fracked, so it's somewhat a…
David Heikkinen: Okay. And then you had a well drilling Signus-3X, could you give a status on that well?
Steven Farris:  Your memory is better than mine.
David Heikkinen: That was in Egypt, offset to…
Steven Farris: I thought Egypt 3X. That was [Hedrip 3X] We found some pay. It was thinner. Actually the well was updip and had a thinner pay, which was surprising because on our seismic picture we thought it would be downdip. So it's going to produce but it's not what we thought it was going to be.
David Heikkinen: So it's not the big discovery. It's 100 BCF, not the 3X.
Steven Farris: But we have a Hedrip 3 drilling as we speak, so we will hold that open. That well was eight kilometers away from the first well.
David Heikkinen: Okay. And then just one quick question. Thinking about Australia volumes, you talked about the gas volumes coming on August and late August and by year end. What's the appropriate ratio of oil ramp that comes with that? Is there any delay on the liquid facility or does it just match?
Steven Farris: Well, we should get a little liquids out of coming up in August, but we have a lot of black oil that goes through the Harriett facility and that Harriett facility -- the Harriett joint venture facility won't be on in December. So we are not going to see significant oil increases in Australia from where we are today until really the end of the year.
David Heikkinen: Okay. That was it. Thanks guys
Steven Farris: Thank you.
Operator: And we will go next to Joe Allman with JP Morgan.
Joe Allman:  Thank you and hi everybody. I apologize if you covered this earlier but can you give us an update on that Reindeer gas contract?
Steven Farris: I would -- we talked about it so much, we ought to be able to give you an update, but I can. We do have a large contingent as I said on the call, a large contingent in Australia as we speak that will be meeting with various levels of the buyer in that and I anticipate that we get this thing done here pretty quickly.
Joe Allman: Okay. And what's been the delay to settling this? 
Steven Farris: The honest delay is indemnity, which is interesting. We are down to lawyer negotiation about what happens if they don't take, what happens if we don't produce, and those events don't generally happen, but you got to ensure that you have mechanism on both sides in case that happens, but that is the hang up.
Joe Allman: Okay, thanks. And then a different issue. In terms of could you just comment on concerns you might have about the availability of steel to drill and develop your programs and also what you are seeing recently with drilling complete costs just across the various areas?
Steven Farris: Steel is a very interesting issue. Probably for the first time in my career because we do a stocking program, certainly for the first time in Apache, we are having to wait on steel. And if we don't take it immediately, sometimes even though we have a stocking program, that steel is not there. And I'm not the only ones that are suffering that, the reason you ask the question I assume. Steel is tight right now. Steel is tight more in this country or North America than it is in other parts of the world right now. We don't have that problem in Egypt. We don't have that problem in Australia. But in North America, that is an issue, and I think one of the reasons is that you got an awful lot more steel being put in the ground. In terms of cost, as you saw in our operating costs are down a little bit in real terms. North American drilling costs, completion costs are pretty level right now frankly.
Bob Dye: Joe, you cut out.
Operator: (Operator Instructions).
Joe Allman: Can you hear me?
Operator: Yeah.
Joe Allman: I appreciate that. Any areas around the world where you are seeing particular tightness in equipment and related cost increases?
Steven Farris: Well, we are not seeing significant increases. We are still -- obviously your waiting time on machines, whether it's turbines or the waiting time is longer. But in most places you can get around that. Like I mentioned earlier, the one place that we are beginning to see really you got to be on a tight leash in this country right now and in Canada is steel.
Joe Allman: Got you, okay. Very helpful, thank you.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). And we will go to Leo Mariani with RBC.
Leo Mariani:  Hi, good afternoon folks. A question on your exploratory program in the second half of the year. You mentioned trying to ramp up activity in the Gippsland Basin, Australia in late 3Q. I was hoping you can give little more detail on what you guys plan to target out there?
Steven Farris: Well, we have four wells on the schedule. Gippsland Basin is a very oily area, has produced over 4 billion barrels of oil. We are drilling a well kind of on the outer shale of two major fields in that areas we call it Block 59, but we are going to drill at least three structures there, closest of which is call Ne Mo. It's certainly not a step out, but it's very close to SOs and BHPs field that made over 900 million barrels. I mean, I am sorry. All right. So we are in a good area and obviously there are exploration place, but we have done an awful lot of seismic work and an awful lot of geology, so.
Analyst: Okay. Jumping over to Canada here, obviously you guys have some pretty significant research potential up in the Ootla area and obviously you have got a lot of land in Canada and in some other places. Just curious to know if you folks have looked at any other sort of emerging resource plays in Canada that may have acreage exposure, things like the [Modern Air] the Bakken oil play, extension up in Saskatchewan?
Steve Farris: One of the things I will say and -- in today's hectic world, it does not behoove you to advertise where you are putting acreage together because if you look at what happens to acreage cost just like they did (inaudible) for instance, when we bought most of our acreage in the Ootla area we probably have and probably we got less than $200 million on our acreage. If we sold our acreage in Ootla today for the latest land sale it would be worth $1 billion. So we are putting acreage together in plays and we get all of the acreage together that we want to get together then we will talk about where our acreage is. And again I am not trying to be evasive, it's just acreage is key today.
Analyst: Okay. Jumping over to Argentina, it looks like your oil price was up to about 50 bucks in the second quarter. My understanding is hearing some shed out there that the government is talking about partially eating some of the restrictions on the oil price selling. Do you guys have any kind of comments on that and how it impacts you all?
Steve Farris: We are allowed some oil price adjustments and some of that is catch-up on oil price adjustments that we haven't seen in the past.
John Crum: But they have allowed, you know, we were getting 42 and then 47. It's not just quality adjustment. What's happening is is the actual purchasers allowed to actually pay a premium for crude oil and without suffering the tax on it. And so what we have seen is a market for crude oil that increases our price without affecting the excise tax and I would expect that to continue. I mean they need oil and natural gas desperately.
Analyst: Okay.
John Crum: The one thing I would say, I apologize for interrupting but the other thing I would say is Roger's comments about the different tiers in Argentina, when we are not redirected we have contracts that go from 250 certainly but up to 390. So you are starting to see prices in Argentina on a market driven prices start to reflect what's happening with respect to limited supply.
Roger Plank: It's happening in the electricity. So they have been able to get away with fixed prices for a long time. I think there is a recognition that that just isn't going to work anymore.
Analyst: Okay. Last question the US operations, you are talking about oil 2008 growth of 2% for the company with upticks in Australia into the North Sea. Is there an expectation for an uptick in the US production in the second half of the year as well?
Steve Farris: Well, we certainly should see our central region buy-ins continue to go up modestly and I think from a quarter-over-quarter, you probably will see our Gulf region go up.
Analyst: Okay. Well, thanks a lot for your time.
Steve Farris: Thank you sir.
Operator: And we will go next to Jeb Armstrong with Calyon Securities.
Jeb Armstrong: Hi good afternoon. Turning back to acquisitions, given that you are one of the largest CBM producers in Canada, is that a reason where you think you would consider making an acquisition?
Steve Farris: Well, I think it was a right opportunity obviously from our perspective and I think most people's perspective is Alberta shot themselves in the foot, and you can gauge that a number of different ways. The lease sales that are going on in BC, the lease sales that are going in Saskatchewan, the activity level inn those two provinces versus Alberta. I think from our standpoint in Canada, we add more value to our company and to our shareholders from land acquisitions and drilling wells than we do from acquisitions and never say never, but that's probably not an area that we would actively pursue a significant producing property acquisition, not unless it brought a tremendous amount of acreage.
Analyst: Got you. And just turning back down to the Gulf of Mexico, following on go through, do you have any plans for any additional deep water wells?
Steven Farris: Well, we don't have any on our drilling schedule right now, but we have a team that is put together to look for those kinds of projects, which is where this project came from. So we continue to develop the geology to be able to find more of these.
Analyst: Good. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we will go back to David Heikkinen.
David Heikkinen: Just a follow up. What do you expect your total capital budget to be for 2008?
Roger Plank: It will be about $6 million, David.
David Heikkinen: Okay.
Roger Plank: We started lower than that but prices have held in and our regions have been able to find some new and interesting things to do, and so we are going to let them expand a little.
Steven Farris: And you have some things going on that affect that. And for instance, go forward work, that's a significant development as well as we'll probably drill three wells in there this year and those wells are not inexpensive.
David Heikkinen: And then what did you sell in Canada and the $142 million of property acquisition? Is that leasing or is there any production with that?
Steven Farris: A little bit of production but for the most part that was a land purchase and that's the one with the acreage buy. In Canada, we sold a number of scattered properties across Alberta.
David Heikkinen: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And there are no more questions in the queue at this time.
Bob Dye: Well, thank you all for joining us. I know for most of you you've had a very busy day, but we appreciate your interest in the company and if any of you have any questions after the call, be sure to give me a call. Thanks.
Operator: And this does concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2008 Q1  (2008-05-01 14:00:00) =====
Executives: Bob Dye – Vice President of Investor Relations G. Steven Farris – President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer & Director Roger B. Plank – Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President John A. Crum – Executive Vice President, President of Apache Canada Ltd.
Analysts: Tom Gardner – Simmons & Co. Int’l Jeffrey P. Hayden – Pritchard Capital Partners Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs David Tameron – Wachovia Capital Markets David Heikkinen – Tudor, Pickering, Holt Ben Dell – Bernstein Gil Yang – Cit Investment Research  
Operator:  Welcome to the Apache Corporation first quarter earning 2008 conference call. (Operator Instructions) At this time for opening remarks and introductions I’d like to turn the program over to Bob Dye, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Bob Dye: This morning Apache Corporation released first quarter 2008 results which totaled net income of $1.02 billion or $3.03 per diluted share. Consistent with prior quarters we also provided adjusted non-GAAP net income for the first quarter that is $2.99 per diluted share with the adjustment primarily related to foreign currency fluctuations on deferred tax balances.  Today’s discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions and no assurance can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located on our website. In addition, any non-GAAP number that we discuss such as adjusted earnings cash flow from operations or cost incurred will be identified as such with the reconciliation located on our website located at www.ApacheCorp.com. Steve Farris our CEO and Roger Plank our CFO will now make prepared remarks prior to taking questions.  With that, I’ll turn the call over to Steve.
G. Steven Farris : Thank you for joining us for Apache’s first quarter earnings conference call. The first quarter was highlighted by our solid financial results. Some excellent explorations success and continued progress in delivering and expanding our major pipeline of visible growth projects.  Our financial results were excellent as we clipped $3.00 per share for the second consecutive quarter and our $1 billion of earnings was driven by $1.84 billion of cash from operations for the quarter. Roger is going to cover the financial results in more detail and I thought I’d go in to some of the operating highlights. We told you at the beginning of the year that 2008 would encompass the largest exploration program in our history in terms of resource exposure and I could not be more pleased with our results so far. We’ve made five important discoveries during the first quarter including Brulimar-1, Julimar Southeast-1, the Haylard-1 all in Australia, the Hydra-1X in Egypt and three wells in our Muskwa Shale play in British Columbia Canada. In addition today we announced the positive results of our Julimar Northwest appraisal well offsetting our Julimar discovery in Australia.  I’ll go over the developments on a regional basis in a few minutes but let me summarize up front our achievements for the first quarter of updated Apache’s future growth profile. We began the year with a pipeline of six major projects scheduled to begin production between the latter part of this year and 2012 which should contribute about 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of new production to Apache.  During the first quarter we had updated this profile in really three main ways. First, we added a seventh development project to our inventory, a new 100 million a day gas plant in Egypt which expected should be online by mid 2010 and should add 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of net production to Apache which increases our visible growth profile from our major projects to 135,000 barrels a day by 2012.  Second, as I mentioned during the first quarter we completed our three important test wells in the Muskwa Shale in the Ootla area of BC which allows us to estimate a resource potential in the play of 9 to 16 TCF of gas net to Apache. And, this area will likely give us very significant long-term natural gas production starting in 2011 and 2012.  We now perceive Ootla potentially becoming the eighth major development project in our portfolio which could increase and extend Apache’s growth visibility in a very material manner above the 135,000 barrels of oil a day from our other seven projects.  Third, our exploration success during the first quarter has added significant resources that will extend some of our major projects. As highlighted we have raised our assessment in the total recoverable reserves in the Julimar area in Australia from one to two TCF to two to four TCF and the Hydra discovery, we have the potential to add up to one TCF of recoverable gas in Egypt. That’s not a bad way to kick off the year. Frankly, most of the exciting part of it is that we’ve only scratched the surface with respect to our exploration program for 2008.  As I’m sure all of you have noted, our daily production for the quarter was up 4% year-on-year which was driven substantially all from oil volumes and that’s good news from a financial realization perspective. On a sequential quarter-to-quarter basis daily production was down 3% due to down time from weather in Canada and our central region of the US. We had pipeline access restrictions in Argentina and the Gulf of Mexico and we also made a decision last year to direct some of our Canadian investment budget from Alberta in to longer term projects in BC. Which, by the way, has tremendous potential long term value and growth for our shareholders.  In our yearend earnings call we gave a projection of 6% production growth for 2008 after we take in to account property sales. So far this year we’ve closed approximately $300 million of sales which will affect our production by a little over 1% in 2008. We still believe 6% growth is attainable however, with the impact of current gas restrictions in Argentina and the potential additional strikes and disruptions in North Sea and lower production in Canada a range of 4% to 6% would probably be more conservative. I’d like to now give you an overview of our regional highlights and in interest of time I’m going to focus on our key growth engine regions of Australia, Canada and Egypt and then I’ll comment briefly on our other solid positions in the North Sea, Argentina and the US. We continue to have exciting news that flows out of Australia.  As I mentioned during the first quarter we completed two successful wells in the Julimar area. Brulimar well had 113 feet of net pay which was followed by our Julimar Southeast-1 well that found 195 feet of pay. We did not test either of these wells because the well logs look very similar to previous wells that we had tested in the field. We have three additional wells that are scheduled to drill in the area through the end of the year which certainly will give us greater clarity to the ultimate reserve estimates.  I hope most of you have read today that we announced the results of our Julimar Northwest-1 well that we logged this week. The well had 43 feet of beautiful sand but importantly, or more importantly from a seismic log and pressure data it indicates that the sand is in communication with our Julimar-1 discovery which is about two miles away from the Northwest well and the Julimar East well which is another two miles east of that well. So, we have a long area with substantial reserves in it. The results of the two wells in the corridor in the just announced Julimar Northwest well certainly adds to our confidence of the growth recoverable reserve assessment of the two to four TCF range.  When we get the appraisal program completed later in the year we’ll follow a dual development track of exploring [LNG] alternatives or also taking that gas in to domestic Australia and market. We tested the Haylard-1 during the first quarter. It tested at 68 million a day from 91 feet of pay. The field is located about 20 miles from our infrastructure so we plan to fast track this development and hopefully start up in 2010 timeframe. We’re obviously very pleased with our Australian exploration program. We have a very deep inventory of high potential wells remaining to be drilled this year both in Carnarvon Basin and also the Gippsland Basin.  From a development project standpoint we’re on schedule with all of them. The Van Gogh development remains on a crack for first production of 20,000 barrels a day net mid 2009. The Pyrenees development which is operated by BHP will likely be on stream by the end of 2009 or at the latest first quarter of 2010 and will add an additional 20,000 barrels a day net. Our Reindeer gas development is on track for a mid 2010 startup at 60 million cubic feet of gas a day net to us.  We’re also close to signing the initial gas contract on that development and expect to have something to announce in the near future. It should demonstrate the gas price upside in our Australian portfolio. Australia will continue to be a very large and important growth driver for the company for many years, driven really by our materiality and the depth of the offshore exploration and project portfolio.  In Canada the big story is our Muskwa Shale play in British Columbia. In April we announced the results of three horizontal wells we drilled during the first quarter of 2008 that had test rates of 5.3, 6.1 and 8.8 million a day. We completed all three wells with six stage frack stimulations. The wells are currently flowing in to our Missile gas plant. I’ve received some questions as to why the 8.8 million a day well floated higher rates than the other two wells. The reason is that all of the fracks in the first two wells had on average about 350,000 pounds of sands pumped per frack.  In the third well we pumped over 700,000 pounds of sand in three of the six fracks and obviously the larger frack size made a difference in the rates. We estimate our net reserve potential to Apache in this play of nine to 16 TCF and for reference our worldwide proven gas reserves at the end of 2007 were 7.8 TCF. We have increased our capital program in Alberta by approximately $200 million primarily in our deep gas drilling in the [Kaybob] area. This change is in direct response to the recent announcement by the Alberta government to address the unattended consequences of their previous royalty increase.  I’ll turn now to Egypt. During the first quarter 2008 we drilled six exploration wells in Egypt. We have three discoveries. The first we announced call the Hydra-1X well in the Shushan concession tested 41 million a day and 13,000 barrels of condensate from 178 foot section in the Jurassic lower Safa section. We also tested 35 million a day and 15,000 barrels a day from a 45 foot section in the AEB.  We are currently appraising this discovery with the [Signas] 3X well that should be down in the next month to month and a half. That well is about a two mile step out to the southeast of our Hydra-1X well. The Hydra area has the potential to contain from 200 BCF to a TCF gas reserves certainly if the appraisal program is positive.  Secondly the Shell operated JDT well in the NEAG Concession tested 3.2 million a day and the third well the West Kanayes-C1X well in our West Kanayes concession has been logged but has yet to be tested. While these results are positive we note that-that’s six exploration wells out of a 40 well exploration program plan for 2008.  On the development side we continue to be on track with the Salam gas plant expansion project which will allow us to increase gross gas production in the area by 200 million a day starting in the fourth quarter of this year. This project should add net production volumes to Apache of about 900 million a day and 45,000 barrels of condensate.  The new development on this front is that we have agreed to move ahead with the construction of an additional plant. It will bring to the market an incremental 100 million a day of gross production in 2010. We anticipate having the same construction organization that is currently completing the Salam plant expansion move over to this new project later this year which has very positive execution, timing and cost management advantages.  The additional facility will net Apache at least 45 million a day and 22,000 barrels of liquid and is projected to be completed by the middle of 2010. We’re also developing several water flood projects in Egypt throughout the next couple of years and those programs are continuing to progress. In the aggregate during the quarter we drilled 44 water flood wells and eight separate projects. Quarter-on-quarter all production increased 11% to 42,600 barrels a day gross and total water injection increased 8% to 52,500 barrels a day. If you take the combination of our continued exploration success and our lower risk drilling activities there’s little doubt that Egypt’s growth will continue for many years.  I’d like to now provide a little highlights from our other areas: the North Sea; Argentina; and the US. In the North Sea our refurbishments to extend the life and optimize the production consistency is starting to bear fruit. In March we achieved the highest average production in the last 18 months at 63,700 barrels a day. Importantly we had zero outages and a strong contribution from two recent wells that we add 8,200 barrels a day.  During the year end conference last February we mentioned the two week maintenance turnaround schedule for the second quarter of 2008 which began on April 17th of this year. The downtime will impact production by 4,000 barrels a day for the quarter but we’re optimistic that production consistency will continue to improve when we’re completed.  Last week I’m sure most of you are aware we had a temporary curve ball thrown at us involving a labor strike at a refinery in Northern Scotland that receives production and supplies power to BP’s 40-pipeline system. All the Forties field production is transported through BP’s pipeline system and the refinery strike caused the pipeline system and all our remaining production from the Forties Field to go down on April 27. At current strike is over and we should be totally back online by the end of this weekend. There are apparently some discussions about another strike occurring in the immediate future however the expectation of that today at least is remote.  In Argentina we continue to have success notably Tierra Del Fuego. We have a very perspective area with respect to material oil discoveries. During the first quarter we drilled five onshore wells that cumulative tested over 4,000 barrels a day. We also made a discovery at Las [Flechas]. It is an exploratory well. We discovered an oil pay in the down throne of the San Sebastian gas field and it’s currently being completed.  I think probably most of you are aware Argentina announced recently that they’re shipping 12 carloads of [LNG]. It’s going to be imported this winter at a price ranging from $12 to $14 per MCF in an effort to offset the predicted short fall in the national market. Obviously this is a very high cost option and underlies the continuing upside from our gas realizations in the country which at some point has to be driven by basic economics. In the US, the central region we had 24 rigs running, drove 126 wells with only one dry hole. I’ll give you two areas of highlights in the central region. One is on our acquired Anadarko property. We drilled 18 wells during the quarter with better than expected results. Today, we have completed 10 of the 18 wells that we’ve drilled for a combined rate of about 880 barrels of oil per day. At today’s prices 880 barrels a day equates to over $35 million of annual revenue.  The second area is our Stiles Ranch area in the Texas panhandle where we also continue to have a successful program. We’re now producing 60 million a day gross. Our acreage position has increased from 5,000 acres to 25,000 acres in the past year. During the quarter we had five rigs working in the area, we drilled 10 wells. So far we’ve completed six of those 10 with an average rate of 2.6 million a day and we expect to further ramp up that activity during the remainder of 2008.  In the Gulf region we average 13 operated rigs during the quarter including four onshore. We have continued activity in our Grand Isle Forty complex. And, importantly, we’ve restored production to pre-2005 hurricane levels at 12,200 barrels a day and 47 million cubic feet of gas a day. One of the main reasons we purchased BP’s Gulf of Mexico properties in 2006 was to increase our interest and become the operator at Grand Isle Forty. The acquisition has turned out to be a big win for us and there still remains a great deal of opportunity in the field.  In summary the first quarter has kicked off in a very positive way for Apache. In addition to achieving solid financial results our success in exploration and project development during the quarter has expanded our portfolio of projects that provide Apache with many years of growth potential. We entered the first quarter with a portfolio of six major projects with 125,000 barrels of oil per day of new production between now and 2012.  During the quarter we launched our seventh project, our third [grass] chain in Egypt that should add about 10,000 barrels a day equivalent net. We tested very successfully our Ootla Shale play in British Columbia and we added significantly to our resources in our existing projects through the drill bit in Australia and Egypt. Our drill bit and progress during the quarter was once again balanced across our portfolio not only in North America but also in a major international hydrocarbon provinces of Australia and Egypt. With most of exploration activity for the year still ahead of us we look forward to continued progress in 2008.
Roger B. Plank: Steve talked about our exploration results and our future growth profile so I thought I’d start by looking back on how far we’ve come financially and how large the numbers have grown from just a year ago. First quarter a year ago our revenues were $2 billion. This year they’ve crossed $3 billion. Oil revenue alone climbed $1 billion to $2.1 billion and comprised over two thirds of our total revenue from just half our production which really speaks to the benefit of our uniquely balanced production mix.  Margins reached record levels. Of our $3 billion of revenue over 30% made it to the bottom line. Obviously a $33 per barrel increase in our oil realizations over a year ago significantly benefited the first quarter but that’s really only part of the story. Oil production climbed 30,000 barrels a day to 261,000 barrels driving our 4% growth and equivalent daily production first quarter to first quarter.  The combination of unprecedented oil prices and higher oil production were the primary drivers behind our earnings doubling from a year ago. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on deferred tax balances Apache earned a record $1.1 billion or $2.99 a share which is twice the $1.48 adjusted amount we earned a year ago. When you earn half a billion more on essentially the same number of shares outstanding returns become very robust. First quarter annualized return on capital employed was 22%. Return on equity was 26%. Cash flow was also robust up by just over half to $1.84 billion for the quarter.  I just thought that this information might be useful perspective on our progress before I swamped you with detailed comparisons of first quarter versus the fourth quarter which I will now go through. Oil and gas revenues rose 6% of $182 million from the prior quarter while total operating costs increased just 3%. This drove our pre-tax earnings 8% higher.  Our after tax earnings of $1.02 billion rivaled the prior quarter’s $1.07 billion and on an apples-to-apples basis adjusting for the impact of the deferred tax balances that I mentioned from foreign currency fluctuations and for Canadian tax rate reduction that occurred in the fourth quarter last year the first quarter’s $1.01 billion were a record and 3% higher than the $982 million of adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter. Per share adjusted earnings of $2.99 were also a record up $0.07 per share sequentially. Cash from operations of $1.84 billion or $5.48 a share was up 4% from the prior quarter. Higher prices mitigated the impact of lower production but drove current taxes up. Despite rising costs pre-tax cash margins reached record levels up 10% sequentially to $45.78 of BOE. Higher prices more than offset rising costs including DD&A our total pre-tax margins increased 13% from the prior quarter to $33.03 of BOE.  Lifting costs for BOE rose to $8.96. While that’s up $0.36 per unit I would note that absolute total costs flattened for the first time in recent memory. So, as our production grows through the remainder of the year LOE per unit produced should drop back below the fourth quarter rate of about $8.60. You should also note that LOE previously included ad valorem taxes and we now include that in the line item entitled taxes other than income in order to get a clearer picture of our actual lifting costs. Full cost DD&A increased 3% sequentially to $11.50 per BOE in line with our expectations given recent drilling costs. G&A costs increased to $1.62 per BOE from $1.42 driven entirely by increased incentive compensation expense following our record year last year and by higher first quarter payroll burdens such as FICA taxes which tend to be front end loaded. Absent these items rising production should drive our future rate to around $1.25 to $1.45 per BOE. Taxes other than income increased $0.91 to $4.78 per BOE which is to be expected given substantially higher commodity prices.  US severance taxes for example rose 14% and North Sea [PRT] basically the equivalent of severance tax increased 25% on the combination of both higher oil volumes than prices. As mentioned this line item now includes ad valorem taxes so we’ve also adjusted prior quarters accordingly. Finance expense decreased $0.15 to $0.87 per BOE on lower average debt balances.  Turning to income taxes our first quarter effective tax rate increased to 39% from 31% in the fourth quarter of 07 primarily due to the one time rate reduction in Canadian taxes during the fourth quarter. Strong commodity prices in the first quarter have also significantly increased current taxable income causing our deferred rate to decrease to 25% of our total tax expense from 39% in the fourth quarter.  Should commodity prices remain strong, absent foreign exchange fluctuations, our effective tax rate and deferred tax percentage are likely to be comparable to first quarter levels over the balance of the year. In the face of tightening global credit markets Apache’s financial condition grew stronger. At 20% debt to cap Apache’s exceptional balance sheet remains a tremendous competitive advantage in carrying out our business strategy to pursue future growth.  So, to sum things up, Apache’s financial results are off to a strong start and production is slated to grow. Add in the fact that current NYMEX prices are substantially higher than first quarter levels of $98 a barrel and $8 per MCF and we could see some very favorable quarter-to-quarter comparisons over the balance of the year.  With that we’d be happy to address any questions you have.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Tom Gardner – Simmons & Co. Int’l.
Tom Gardner – Simmons & Co. Int’l:  Steve, you’re spinning off a lot of free cash flow here driving down sort of our models debt to cap, what level are you most comfortable with and how you see deploying that free cash flow in the near future?
G. Steven Farris : Well, the first quarter we had about $300 million worth of sales included in that cash line that I think you see on our abbreviated balance sheet so it’s not quite as large. The other thing I would say which I say constantly and periodically is that we allocate capital quarterly and we are very active right now.  I would tell you with respect to production we expect the first quarter to be the lowest quarter of the year and we have a very active program going on in a number of places. We’ve got the Salam gas plants coming on fourth quarter. But, I think we’re going to have to go through the year and see what our capital program is and also if these prices hold. We’ve lost about $9 a barrel in the last three or four days on the oil price, it’s pretty volatile out there right now.
Tom Gardner – Simmons & Co. Int’l: Just kind of related to then your growth strategy, with these higher commodity prices we’ve heard some of the majors express regrets over certain investments, I think Forties field was mentioned specifically by one. What is the outlook for large scale unsolicited acquisitions? I mean, are you seeing the opportunity there?
G. Steven Farris : We never plan for acquisitions because they’re events not really a strategy. Having said that, we are a very inquisitive company and we have been since inception and we constantly look for things from a well in west Texas that’s on the Internet that somebody is selling to larger acquisitions.  I will tell you this, in all honestly we are beginning to see that market loosen up a little bit and we don’t have anything we’re doing right now nor do we have anything even on our horizon. But, if you’re in the market you begin to see, certainly not from the big three right now but certainly there are starting to be properties that are out there that are for sale. The real question is can you find something that’s in an area that you like.
Roger B. Plank: I think part of that is this credit crunch, to those with strong balance sheets is perhaps a bit of a benefit. Those who don’t have strong balance sheets are seeing the cost of their borrowing go up significantly or aren’t able to borrow further funds so as credit gets tight the remaining resort for some is to sell properties. So, we’re starting to see a little more of that kind of thing.
Tom Gardner – Simmons & Co. Int’l:  One other question I had just given your success in the shale in Canada are you looking at other unconventional resource acquisition opportunities in the lower 48 or perhaps outside North America all together?
G. Steven Farris :   We’re in an opportunity business. Certainly, we don’t have any stealth plays out there that we are ready to announce but this business is a business of opportunity and we continue to look for it. We have a new ventures group that whether it’s in Canada, Argentina or anywhere else in the world we continue to look for opportunities. Interestingly, we’re looking at a shale in Argentina right now.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jeffrey P. Hayden – Pritchard Capital Partners.
Jeffrey P. Hayden – Pritchard Capital Partners: Just wondering if you could touch on your activities in the Gippsland Basin so far and what the expectations are for kind of the future drilling activity out there?
G. Steven Farris : In fact Raymond and I and one of our directors just got back from Australia and spent a week in our office there. We’ve drilled pre-dry holes with a jack up, none of which were of the size of the wells that we’re going to drill later this year in what’s called Block-59 which is by far the highest potential in that area. They’re very dissimilar with respect to prospect geological traps and I’ll be real honest with you, they’re exploration wells but I’m tremendously high on the first three we’re going to drill. We really have the potential to find a large amount of oil.
Jeffrey P. Hayden – Pritchard Capital Partners: What’s kind of the timing on those three wells?
G. Steven Farris : We expect to get a rig in July, later part of July, a floater that we have contracted and it depends on whether or not the current contract person that has the rig drills an option well or not. It will either be July, or probably if it’s not in July then it will be in September because they’ll drill one more well.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs:  Could you talk a little bit more on the Western Australia side, timing of various gas price contracts? And additionally how you see any exploration that you’re doing nearby anything against the infrastructure that could come on over the next couple of years? Could you give us an update there?
G. Steven Farris : In terms of where we are frankly I would think we are very, very near to announcing the contract that we’ve been talking about now since the turn of this year. I would expect that to happen in May. I may be wrong but I think we’re down to a point where it’s nit and nats.  In terms of projects that we have in front of us, we just announced the Haylard well that is actually a discovery that could come through our [Veranus] Island very easily, it’s about 20 miles north of an oil field that we have that was depleted that will bring the pipeline back through what’s called East Spar. The name is not as important as we could get that on in 18 months.  Later in the year we’re also drilling a well called Rosella, a well that we drilled later last year that actually had quite a bit of gas in it and we expect to be able to get that drilled later this year but it is hat is very close to the John Brookes Field and also East Spar so both of those discoveries or potential discoveries could come back to our island. We’re upgrading our island to add about 100 million a day of capacity to come out of there from compressors so we will have some potential there.  We’re also drilling a well called Marley which is directly north of [Veranus] Island that we would just tie back to one of our platforms off of [Veranus] Island and bring back through. We’ve got two or three shots to be able to do that.
Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs: On the Egypt front with the third processing facility now approved at what point does that give you the ability or willingness in going to the Egyptian government and potentially trying to negotiate higher gas price terms?
G. Steven Farris : You must be visionary. We should be in front of the Egyptians the first part of next week.
Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs: Any initial thoughts on the timing of that process?
G. Steven Farris : I don’t know but we are going to make them a proposal. We will see how receptive that is.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Tameron – Wachovia Capital Markets.
David Tameron – Wachovia Capital Markets: Could you talk a little bit more about Argentina? You mentioned briefly some of the pipeline issues. Can you give us a little more detail there?
G. Steven Farris : The situation is, is that Tierra del Fuego obviously an island on the very tip of the pipeline is 550 miles long and it goes up to Buenos Aires and what has happened recently, like over the last three or four months, is that Chevron and Petrobras are on the mainland and they are actually over-injecting gas into that pipeline which basically makes the line pressure so high that you can’t get gas into it.  When I was down there about a month ago we talked to the Governor of the Province of Tierra del Fuego about the fact that the Province was losing royalties and also losing price in terms of being able to get their gas in that pipe. We have seen a little relief in the last three or four weeks. In fact we got some indication that Tierra del Fuego was going to be able to back Chevron and Petrobras out, but that’s a little bit of a wait and see game.  We could come back and stay where we are or we could see Chevron and Petrobras that had big fields on the mainland continue to over-inject and honestly I wish we could solve that problem. This is not a well issue, it’s purely a restriction issue.
David Tameron – Wachovia Capital Markets: It sounds like there’s no definitive timeline on the back end to get this resolved? It’s a wait and see, like you said?
G. Steven Farris : The real answer to this, and I don’t know if you follow what’s going on down there, they’re increasing the capacity of that line that’s supposed to be done by the middle of 2009 by 250 million a day and then they have a longer term project to bring the capacity of that line up to 500 million a day.  We can find a lot of gas in Tierra del Fuego and there’s a tremendous need for gas, especially in the Buenos Aires area. That is the longer term solution. The shorter term solution was we could we put some additional compression. The other thing we have considered is doing another LPG plant down there where we re-inject gas and take the liquids off the additional gas. I will tell you we are exploring the alternatives for it. The only thing I would say is this is an island issue. Total is significantly constrained also.
David Tameron – Wachovia Capital Markets: The move into Australia, can you talk about the Northwest well that you announced, Northwest Number One, you mentioned in the press release communication with, I think it was Julimar East or Julimar One?
G. Steven Farris : It’s both, Julimar One and Julimar East.
David Tameron – Wachovia Capital Markets: I think those wells you mentioned were four or five miles away, how big do you think this can be and can you talk about the relevance of the communication there?
G. Steven Farris : In terms of the overall clock we’re going to drill a well called Grange starting pretty quickly that’s in the Groban between our Julimar discovery and also the Julimar well. It has a lot of merit to it. In terms of the overall accumulation we definitely believe that it has very good potential to be the 2 to 4 TCF of gas.
David Tameron – Wachovia Capital Markets: You had previously mentioned 1 to 2, so I’m just trying to figure out.
G. Steven Farris : We drilled more wells and I will tell you the other thing is that we’re using obviously amplitude, seismic conversion. We have drilled six out of seven discoveries, the one well that was not a discovery did not have the attributes. We were drilling really for a deeper sand so we’re basically six out of six for amplitudes off of our seismic conversions. We feel very comfortable with our geologic picture.
David Tameron – Wachovia Capital Markets: Any update on pricing in Australia from what you’ve said prior quarter?
G. Steven Farris : I will tell you the pricing is definitely on the rise. I don’t know if you’ve seen any of our presentations. Certainly in the past we’ve gotten from $1 to $2 and I think we’re a little bit higher than that right now. We’re looking at North of $6 for gas now from spot sales, from short term contracts in the five year range, we’re looking for significant price increase there. Hopefully we’ll be able to announce this contract in the near future and it will give you some indication of the pricing.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Heikkinen – Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
David Heikkinen – Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co., LLC: First one follow up question on the Australian TDF pipeline, what’s the current capacity of that line? You said you had increased it.
G. Steven Farris : Argentina. I think TDF takes about 500 million a day.
David Heikkinen – Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co., LLC: So it’s going to double in capacity?
G. Steven Farris : Through 2007 they’re supposed to upgrade it by 250 million a day by the middle of 2009.
David Heikkinen – Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co., LLC: As you think about that expansion what percentage of the expansion would go for Apache and what would go for Total?
G. Steven Farris : We’re in the throes of discussing that. We obviously would like to have gas on that system.
David Heikkinen – Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co., LLC: Switching to another pipe and plant, up at Ootla, the missile plant, what is the gas plant capacity there?
G. Steven Farris : Right now if we put a compressor on it we could do about 50 million a day out of that plant. We will have to put more infrastructure in to get higher there. I don’t know if any of you read that we have a new partner in our Ootla area, Exxon announced that they had bought 115,000 acres in the Horn River play since September. 
David Heikkinen – Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co., LLC: As you think about plant capacity in the area are there are any other companies that are actually producing oils into a plan and getting sustained production history from the wells that you know of?
John A. Crum : [Nexun] is just getting ready to start.
G. Steven Farris : John Crum is sitting here with us. He runs our Canadian region. He said there’s no one on yet but [Nexun] is just getting ready to put some of their wells in.
John A. Crum : [Inaudible] later this year.
G. Steven Farris : EOG has announced that sometime in June they’re going to put some gas.
David Heikkinen – Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co., LLC: At year end you’ll have at least Apache and potentially [Nexun] and EOG will be able to give a lot more details as far as productivity or at least the potential to give a lot more details as far as productivity from Canadian shale?
G. Steven Farris : You bet. The other thing I would tell you is early results from not only the tests but early results of our, because we are producing gas, are favorable. We feel good about what we’re seeing.
Operator: We’ll go now to Ben Dell – Bernstein.
Ben Dell – Bernstein: I had a quick question around the gas model because in general you’ve obviously gone off the natural gas in regions where prices are depressed, when you look around the world at areas like Libya or Algeria even Russia do any of those appeal to you as next places to go?
G. Steven Farris : I don’t imagine anybody would let us in Russia any more. We continue to look and honestly we looked at Libya early on during the first bid round and that was a very difficult bid round and I don’t know that it’s gotten a tremendous amount better in terms of what your takes are. The new ventures group that I alluded to earlier doesn’t just look for shale plays in the United States or North America. It’s a game of opportunity and we’re looking for opportunities that other people haven’t seen or early stages.
Roger B. Plank: You may well be aware but we got intrigued with the upside of Tierra del Fuego and even when we were looking at the first acquisition there, the guys noticed basically right down the middle is the border so obviously what we saw on the Argentine side probably didn’t stop just because the man-made border is there.  That’s what led to our bidding on and getting 1 million net acres on the other side where pricing seems to be better and the price regulations aren’t in place. While that’s a ways off and about all we’ll do is we’ll focus on a shoot seismic. If that does have the kind of potential that exists on the Argentine side that’s right up our alley. We’re already there, we can run it out of the same office and it’s got interesting potential.
G. Steven Farris : We have now officially signed those concession agreements. We should be moving a seismic crew in there in June and hopefully with any luck we’ll have a well drilled by the end of the year.
Ben Dell – Bernstein: Just following up on that in South America there’s been some talk out of Brazil that domestic gas consumption is growing up 20% per annum, do you see any indications from the Brazilians that they’re willing to open up just for the shallower or shelf areas or onshore for their [inaudible] participants to come in especially looking for gas?
G. Steven Farris : They talk about being open for business but the fact of the matter is it’s very difficult to get concessions in those areas away from Petrobras.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gil Yang – Cit Investment Research.
Gil Yang – Cit Investment Research: Steve, can you talk about in Argentina going back there for a moment, did the reduced volumes contribute to the higher prices in the region because you were able to sell less of the lower priced residential gas?
G. Steven Farris : It may be a couple of cents but not really. What we’ve really seen over the last 12 months is we continue to see prices increase in terms of industrial volumes and also in terms of people knocking on their door and wanting gas. There is a move right now actually by the unions and [Donic] and to get together with the producers and demand higher gas prices because the fact of the matter is they see the same problem. They see shrinking investment which means something happening to their jobs.  In fact we just met with them last week. In all of these areas, and I will tell you, the one thing people hopefully understand about is look at quarter-to-quarter but we are more of a long term player. I feel very good about gas production and oil production going throughout the year and I feel very good about gas prices in Argentina. I think you’ll see it. Will we have some hiccups? Sure we will.
Gil Yang – Cit Investment Research: I was just under the impression that a good chunk of the price increase in the last couple quarters was more due to a mix effect than actual prices rising. Or you were just getting more high price gas.
G. Steven Farris : I think what you’re seeing is not just a mix. Definitely [Donic] is a higher price because number one you have more markets there, you can get the gas there easier so you have the potential of finding different markets. In terms of the overall gas price in Argentina it is definitely creeping up and I wouldn’t be surprised if it jumped up here in the next 12 months.
Roger B. Plank: I think that’s all exactly right. The one thing Gill that maybe you’ve got in the back of your mind is they’re just coming out of their summer months and everything is upside down in Argentina. You go in to the winter, that’s when the greatest call is on low fixed price gas for residential use so there is in effect a winter to summer effect that you’re probably seeing in our higher realizations but we haven’t seen these realizations I don’t think this decade. So, what’s Steve is talking about is the primary driver. 
Gil Yang – Cit Investment Research: So then as we go in to the winter, their winter, do you think that your average price may drop temporarily? 
Roger B. Plank: I think that’s going to be a factor.
G. Steven Farris : You bet it will.
Roger B. Plank: But I don’t think it’s going back to yesterday’s levels.
Gil Yang – Cit Investment Research: Just backing off from a more macro perspective, I know that you don’t typically do a lot of hedging but given that oil was at $120 a few days ago, it’s back up quite a bit, have you given any thought to locking in some prices here?
G. Steven Farris : We should have done that a couple of days ago. I think Roger alluded to the fact that we have 20% debt. I think we certainly have plenty of cash flow to fuel the opportunities that we have in front of us so that’s somewhat our hedge frankly.
Operator:  That would conclude our question and answer session. 
Roger B. Plank:  Thanks for joining us. I know you’ve had a gazillion call today but if any of you have any follow up questions feel free to give me a call after we’re done here. Thank you very much.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Apache Corporation fourth quarter earnings 2007 conference call. Today's presentation will be hosted by Mr. Bob Dye, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Dye, please go ahead.
Bob Dye: Thanks for joining us today. This morning Apache Corporation released fourth quarter and annual 2007 results which on a reported basis totaled $3.19 and $8.39 respectively.  But consistent with prior quarters, we have provided adjustments to those numbers which reflect one-time items which are non-GAAP that totaled $2.92 and $8.65 per share respectively. Our adjustments primarily relate to foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the Canadian federal tax rate on the deferred tax balances that are on our balance sheet. Today's discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions and no assurance can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located on our website. In addition any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations or adjusted cost incurred will be identified as such with the reconciliation, again located on our website at www.apachecorp.com. Steve Farris, our CEO and Roger Plank, our CFO will now make prepared remarks prior to taking questions. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Farris: Thank you, Bob. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for our year end 2007 earnings call. For Apache, 2007 was a year of high impact exploration success, on track development of major projects and very strong and balanced production growth. Apache achieved record results in virtually every measurable financial and operating category. Production grew at 12% to a new record average level of 561,000 barrels oil equivalent a day in 2007 which marks to the 28th year out of the last 29 that Apache has grown its production. We have grown through good and bad times in the balanced deep portfolio we have built during all those years, meaning that we now have a growth engine that is capable of continuing that stream into the foreseeable future. In 2007, we replaced a 167% of production in terms of SEC proved reserves. Proved reserves additions from the drill-bit alone replaced a 140% of production and outstanding reserve addition performance and it should support Apache's continued growth path and has led to record proved reserves at 2.450 billion barrels oil equivalent at year end. 2007 marked the 22nd year of consecutive reserve growth for Apache. Adjusted earnings of $2.9 billion increased 26% over 2006 and eclipse the previous record set in 2005 by 11%. Our balanced portfolio profile delivered outstanding results in 2007 and clearly showed the upside potential we have across commodities, plays and countries in the current environment. Adjusted earnings per share of $8.65 increased 25% over 2006 and broke the previous record set in 2005. Our cash flow from operations is $6.2 billion increased 22% over our previous record set in 2006. 2007 was a year of high impact and broad-based exploration success, most notably in Australia. We discovered the Julimar complex in April of '07. We estimated gross recoverable resource potential is between 2 and 4 Tcf currently. Apache has a 65% working interest in this block. During the course of 2007 we completed four wells in the area which have given us increased confidence of this 2 to 4 Tcf gross recoverable estimate. The latest well which is the Brulimar-1x was completed in January and had a 113 feet of net pay which we chose not to test because of an excellent result. In Canada, our utilized Ootla shale gas play in Northern British Columbia took an important step forward. We drilled and tested one horizontal well and tested two wells that we had previously drilled vertically. The preliminary test results encouraged us to acquire additional acreage during the year which now stands at over 400,000 gross acres. In Egypt, we made several deep Jurassic oil and gas discoveries which include the Jade, Alexandrite, Imhotep discoveries in the Matruh Concession which is in Northern part of the Greater Khalda area and they all had tremendous flow rates. We also made discoveries in the Northeast Abu Gharadig concession, operated by Shell and an interesting discovery in East Ras Badran that tested over 1,900 barrels a day. It's on an onshore concession area near the Gulf of Suez and we will drill appraisal wells to all these discoveries in 2008. Each of these highlighted discoveries and the other ones across our international portfolio added recoverable resources to Apache, representing a multiple of what we are recognizing at this point in our proved reserves. And this underlines the resource depth of our portfolio. 2007 was also a very successful year for Apache in progressing six large development projects that will add over a 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day of production over the 2009-2011 timeframe. These six projects include Australia's Van Gogh, Pyrenees, Reindeer and Julimar and Egypt's Salam gas plant expansion and water flood activities. On total in 2007, we spent on E&P activities $5.25 billion with $4.2 billion on exploration and development. If you relate this level of investment to our proved reserve additions for the year, you will derive at 2007 finding and development cost of $15.31 per BOE for all sources and $14.76 per BOE from exploration and development activities alone. On the acquisitions side in 2007, we purchased 70 million barrels of oil equivalent which is primarily oil reserves from Anadarko for a price of $1 billion. It is hard to believe that oil prices were $55 a barrel when we completed that transaction last February. The acquisition has been a success both from a financial and operating perspective. Today we are producing over 12,000 barrels of oil equivalent from these properties and have a significant drilling program planned in 2008. All in all 2007 was an outstanding year and we achieved record financial and operating results while executing a very successful worldwide exploration program that really enhanced our deep development and growth pipeline for the future. I would like now to address 2008 which is shaping up to be another year of numerous high impact growth catalysts for Apache. We have previously provided guidance for 2008 in a 6% to 10% reduction growth and we remained comfortable with that range. I want you to bear in mind at the end of last year we took the opportunity to sell or have contracted to sell $360 million of marginal properties. So at this point, we anticipate being at the lower end of that range. Currently our overall 2008 capital budget is coming in at about 5% higher than last year and will be directed at continued delivery of our portfolio of opportunities. As many of you are aware, Apache allocates capital quarterly to our regions so that our going-in budget is preliminary at best. The most obvious catalyst in 2008 is our exploration program which is nearly our most ambitious program ever and potentially exposes the company to over 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent of recoverable hydrocarbon resources. In Australia we plan an active drilling program in the Carnarvon Basin. We will drill five additional wells at Julimar which will go a long way in defining the ultimate resource potential to block. Also on the Carnarvon, we will drill two key appraisal wells at Hilliard and Maitland and both of these areas have multi-hundred Bcf potentials. In the aggregate, the recoverable resource potential of the 2008 Carnarvon Basin exploration program is in excess at 900 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our interest across the Carnarvon Basin program that I just outlined is between 50% and 100%. Elsewhere in Australia in 2008, we will drill seven wells in the Gippsland Basin on a acreage that is adjacent to several giant producing fields. This exploration program has more upside potential than any other exploration program in the company. The first three wells will be drilled with a jack up beginning next month followed by four wells later in the year to be drilled with a semi-submersible. Recoverable resource potential in this program is over 500 million barrels of oil equivalent. In Canada, we have nine well program planned in Ootla shale in British Columbia this winter with our 50% partner in Canada. Our goal is to determine whether the supply is commercial and will be experimenting with different multistage fracturing programs to enhance the flow rate. If the play is commercial, it would expose the company to three to six Tcf of reserve additions net to Apache's interest. In Egypt, we plan to drill 40 exploration wells in 2008, many targeting the deep Jurassic which has yielded several large discoveries to Apache in the past. We have started this year out with a major exploration success of Hydra-1X discovery in Egypt which was announced two weeks ago and tested 42 million a day and 1300 barrels of condensate from the lower Jurassic. The 2008 exploration program in Egypt, the 40 wells, includes a diverse range of plays and prospects which highlight the richness and depth and extent of our portfolio in the country. We'll be drilling 18 shallow Upper Bahariya, Abu Roash prospects, six cretaceous AEB wildcats and 12 deep Jurassic wildcat. We will also drill four wildcats in our Tharwa acreage, which we acquired last year. The recoverable resource potential of the Egyptian exploration program is excess of a 130 million barrels of oil equivalent. All-in-all, 2008 exploration program exposes the company to over 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent of resource potential, net rate to Apache's working interest. On the development side in 2008, we will continue progressing the six major projects that alone will add over 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent to our production in 2009, 2011 timeframe. Continued delivery of these major industry projects on time and within budget, as we approach our on-stream day, will be an important catalyst for Apache in 2008. At Van Gogh, the development in Australia, all development wells will be down by mid-year and the facilities constructions is on schedule to achieve post production by the middle of 2009 at a net rate to Apache of 20,000 barrels of oil a day. At the Pyrenees development which is operated by BHP, facilities construction will begin this year with development drilling schedule to start in the first quarter of 2009. This project will come online in late 2009 or early 2009 again at a net rate to Apache at 20,000 barrels of oil a day. At Reindeer, which is a gas discovery, we will grow two development wells and began pipeline and onshore natural gas processing plant construction. The field is slated to begin producing in the middle of 2010 at a net rate of 60 million a day to Apache. At Julimar, we will complete the appraisal program this summer and look to sanctioning the project in the second half of the year. The field will come online in 2011, and we estimate that the net plough rate to Apache is about, 200 million a day. In Egypt, we expect to finish the construction on the Salam gas plant expansion by yearend, which will add 90 million to 100 million a day net and 4500 barrels of condensate net to Apache's at the end of the year. We are also continuing our expansion of several Egyptian water flood projects with continued drilling and increase water rejection capacity to build toward net production 20,000 barrels oil a day. Aside from these major exploration and development projects, we have an active program planned in the US, Canada and the North Sea and I might just run through them real quickly. In the Central Region, we continue an active drilling program with 307 totaled wells planned. We will focus on our primary Anadarko basis drilling play for the Red Fork spring on Atoka, as well as further exploiting the properties acquired in 2007 in the Permian Basin. In the Gulf region, we will continue to develop the grant of 40 complex and focus on other opportunities really around our production base. We will run a similar program to the past couple years with 60 to 65 wells planned and 8 to 10 operated rigs running. In Canada, recent changes in the royalty rates in Alberta have caused us to redirect our 2008 capital spending. Our drilling activity plans have been refocused by what we consider to be shortsighted decision by the Alberta government with their announcement of significant royalty increases starting in 2009. We have cut our 2008 capital program in Alberta by 40% predominantly associated with deeper gas drilling. Ironically those are the places that can provide Alberta with larger discoveries providing production growth with a smaller footprint. We would hope that the government will reconsider their decision but in the mean time we have increased our activity in British Columbia and Saskatchewan. The reduction in Apache's Alberta activities will be made up in large part by increasing our activity in the Ootla shale play. As we are constantly reminded, the richness and growth opportunity of our balanced portfolio is demonstrated in this case. In the North Sea, our program will be dissimilar to 2007, which includes drilling 16 wells at Forties. We will also continue refurbishing the tops sides with plans to finish installing gas-lift compression capacity and additional water injection capacity. Consistent with previous calls, we want to inform you that we have a scheduled maintenance turnaround at our Alpha platform in April that will reduce our production by 4000 barrels a day in the second quarter of '08. And finally I'd like to talk a little bit about the fundamentals of international gas, which may also provide catalyst to Apache in 2008. In 2007, we saw strong price conversion of low domestic gas prices to levels required to meet supply growth requirements and compete with other international markets. Apache generates top tier returns in countries like Australia, Egypt and Argentina at low prices we have seen historically. Today, international supplies certainly are not available at $1 to $2 gas. As gas prices move up to the $7 level, our real upside will be apparent. We also hope, you noticed our fourth quarter 2007 realized natural gas price in Argentina increased to a $1.60, which is over $0.50 higher than any quarter we've reported since entering the country. This number is 45% realization upside versus our previous record in the country and is based on fundamentals of supply and demand and not speculative activity on the NYMEX. Australia in particular provides a good example of how international gas fundamentals will provide important catalyst for Apache in 2008. I know many of you are aware that natural gas prices in the Carnarvon Basin increased from under $2 to over $7 in the past year due to increased gas demand from the mining industry and large takeaway capacity from LNG, which is priced in the spot market against highest price offered internationally be it Henry Hub or other. We tendered 80 million cubic feet of gas a day of our Reindeer production to the mining industry, with first delivery beginning in 2010 and received over 20 expressions of interest. We are currently negotiating with one buyer for most of that gas and a contract will represent a good barometer, as to how much the Western Australian gas market has strengthened. We hope to announce something soon as early as this quarter. In the second half of 2008 we will explore markets for Julimar gas by again tendering volumes to the Western Australian markets, as well as investigating the viability of LNG. The marketing results of Reindeer and Julimar could both provide meaning catalyst to our shares. I would like to close with a few comments and then I would like to turn it over to Roger Plank, our Chief Financial Officer. We had record financial and operating results in 2007, but more importantly had built tremendous growth momentum that extends our visibility well in to the next decade. Our development pipeline is absolutely world class with six development projects coming online in 2009 to 2011 that will add over a 100, 000 barrels a day of production We intend to add to that development pipeline in 2008 with the strongest inventory of exploration opportunities we have ever had, with major programs in the Carnarvon and Gippsland basins of Australia, the Western Desert of Egypt and our shale play in Northern BC, 2008 we will expose the company to greater resource addition potential than in any previous year in our history. So we look forward to continued success in 2008. Roger?
Roger Plank: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We've talked over the years about Apache's portfolio approach to the business, and our balanced commodity mix and geographic diversity have enabled a portfolio effect in the form of yet another year of consistent profitable results. We spent decades building a company capable of delivering such a performance and frankly while our approach may not always be in favor, it's certainly difficult to argue with the results. Just about anyway you slice it, 2007 was a standout with unparalleled results in our 53 years. Records were reached in all key categories of revenues, cash from operations, earnings, reserves and production. The benefits of unprecedented oil prices and our second highest gas realizations were multiplied by a 12% rise in production to 561,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, driving Apache's oil and gas revenue up 23% to a notable $10 billion. It is also notable that $3 billion of the $10 billion was generated in the final quarter which we hope might provide sort of a sneak preview of things to come in 2008. Cash from operations crossed $6 billion for the first time and at $6.2 billion, was up 22%, almost just as we added a fifth quarter to the year's results. Cash flow per share totaled $18.52, that's more than triple of what it was just five years ago. Over one-quarter of our $10 billion in revenue made it to the bottom line, at $2.8 billion Apache's record 2007 earnings were up over a quarter of a billion dollars. Earnings per share of $8.39 increased 10% from $7.64 per share the prior year. Adjusting for the impact that foreign currency fluctuations and a reduction in Canadian taxes had on deferred tax balances, Apache earned $8.65 a share, up 25% from 2006 adjusted earnings. Apache continues to deliver competitive results with return on capital employed and return on equity reaching 16% and 20% respectively. Our record financial results are an outcrop of exceptional operating performance at EBITDA line. In addition to driving production higher for the 28 over the last 29 years, reserves grew for the 22nd consecutive year, up 6% to 2.4 billion barrels equivalent, that's 7.2 barrels equivalent behind each share. Of our 2.4 billion barrels equivalent, 343 million barrels equivalent were added in the last year alone at a cost of $15.31 per BOE, replacing a 167% of the year's production. Interestingly 84% of our additions before revisions resulted from exploration and development. The 286 million barrels added through the drill-bit at $14.76 per BOE, replaced a 140% of Apache's production which speaks volumes as to the effectiveness of Apache's drilling program. In a day and age where competition for both opportunities and services is intense, it would be easy for a company to hit the wall by running short no drilling opportunities and long on costs. Hopefully our results demonstrate the business hardly the case here at Apache. Nowhere were Apache's results more noteworthy than in the fourth quarter of '07 exceeding both our own expectations and those of the Street's. Fourth quarter revenues crossed the $3 billion mark for the first time, that's up $1 billion from fourth quarter '06 and a $0.5 billion from the third quarter of '07. Record oil prices of $83 a barrel, enabled oil to contribute some two-thirds of our revenue despite representing less than half of our production. Compared to fourth quarter '06, cash from operations increased $636 million to $1.9 billion, while cash flow per share of $5.71 rose 48% from a year earlier. Compared to the prior quarter cash flow increased by $300 million or $0.88 a share and earnings for the quarter crossed $1 billion for the first time, up more than a 100% from fourth quarter a year ago and 75% higher than the prior quarter. To be fair, fourth quarter of '07 included $89 million of positive adjustments or uppers items that went our way for a change and they are not likely to be repeated. The reduction in Canadian federal tax rate reduced deferred taxes as a result of adjusting our deferred cash balances. This added a $135 million to the quarter's earnings and more than offset a $46 million increase in deferred taxes internationally, reflecting continued weakness in the US dollar. Combining these two items benefited the quarter by $89 million or $0.27 a share, so on an adjusted basis fourth quarter '07 earnings of $982 million were up a 107% from adjusted fourth quarter '06 earnings. On a per share basis fourth quarter adjusted earnings totaled a record $2.92 per share twice the dollar $1.40 of a year ago and handily beating a consensus estimates of $2.52 by 16%. Cost remained an issue for both Apache and the industry as a whole as I will go into shortly. However, I would note that despite rising cost, Apache's fourth quarter cash margins topped $40 a barrel for the first time. To put this in perspective, it was only two years ago that our entire realized price for the year broke $40 a barrel for the first time. Zeroing in on cost and margin, let me confuse you with numerous comparisons, I am just going to compare fourth quarter to third quarter to focus on the most recent sequential changes. As mentioned earlier, cash margins reached record levels rising 19% over third quarter of '07 to $41.51 per BOE, while cost rose, higher prices more than offset the increase, even if you include DD&A our total pre-tax margins rose to $29.24 of BOE, up from $22.73 sequentially. Lifting cost per BOE rose to a reported $8.90 per BOE from $8.21 last quarter, obviously high prices are a double-edged sword when it comes to cost. To fully grasp where costs are going, you should be aware of a number of items outside of our base running rate, such as foreign exchange impact, some lingering hurricane repair and incentive-based compensation expense, if you normalize for these items, lifting cost rose 3% to $8.30 per BOE from $8.05 per BOE on an adjusted basis in the third quarter of '07. Workover expense, which continues to provide positive production impacts, accounted for $0.09 of the increase, but generally higher costs accounting for the balance. For 2008, we had estimated a range of 8.25, just say 8.75 per BOE for sort of our base running rate, depending on what your expectations for prices are. Full-cost DD&A increased 2% sequentially to $11.13 per BOE, although drilling cost had moderated somewhat in certain areas, they continue above historic levels. G&A cost increased to $1.42 per BOE from $1.19 driven by increased stock-based compensation expense on a higher stock price. Removing this variable again to look at sort of a base running rate drops G&A per BOE to $1.12 up from an adjusted $1.01 in the third quarter. For 2008 adjusted G&A per BOE should fall in the range of say $1.5 to $1.15 per BOE. Severance and other taxes of $3.57 per BOE increased to $1.15 quarter-over-quarter primarily driven by 16% higher North Sea volumes combined with 18% higher oil price realizations, which resulted in more PRT. Finance expense decreased $0.15 to $1.2 per BOE of significantly lower debt balances. And turning to income taxes. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate dropped 31% from 48% in the third quarter due primarily to two issues. First the third quarter rate was higher because the Australian and Canadian currency strengthened during that particular quarter adding to our deferred tax. And the second issue has to do with a fourth quarter catch up adjustment for the Canadian tax reduction mentioned earlier. For the year, our effective tax rate was 39.8% and the portion of taxes that was differed averaged 48%. Looking back on my prior notes, I realized my predictive skills in this area fall far short. But absent the unforeseen our effective tax rate should approximate 40% of which 40% to 45% should be deferred. Before closing, I'd like to amplify on Steve's comments about why we have higher hopes for 2008 and beyond. In a nutshell, I believe Apache is in the best shape for the best outlook that we have ever had. 2008 production growth is virtually assured. Our backlog of large scale development prospects has never been greater providing visible sources of growth into the next decade. Our worldwide acreage position of over a million acres -- of over 40 million acres is second to none in the upstream sector and a very important key to our continued growth. We have another active year plan for 2008, as Steve indicated, it's again a portfolio effect, a number of lower risks singles and doubles combined with our highest potential exploration program to-date and again as Steve indicated, we are off to a fast start with meaningful discoveries in both Egypt and Australia. From a financial standpoint, we have also never been stronger. Solid production should underpin cash flow that more than covers our preliminary E&D budget of somewhere around $4.5 billion dollars. And finally Apache's strong balance sheet with 22% debt as a percentage of capitalization is a real asset during a highly uncertain period for the economy. In the tightening credit markets there are fall out of the subprime debacle, Apache's A rated balance sheet gives us a tremendous competitive advantage in accessing capital at reasonable cost with which to continue to carryout our business strategy. So, with that, we'd be happy to address any questions you might have.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And we'll take our first question comes from Tom Gardner with Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.
Tom Gardner - Simmons & Company: Yeah, good morning, guys.
Steve Farris: Good Morning
Tom Gardner - Simmons & Company: Just with respect to Argentina and the gas market, do you anticipate the recent price trend to continue and is the market now at a point where you might be able to increase your gas directed capital spending in the country?
Roger Plank:  Well with respect to the gas price frankly, we do expect it to continue. If you look at some of the later contracts that we've signed over the last quarter to quarter and half, one was with major fertilizer that we contracted for three years at $3.50 that's going to $3.90 over a three year period. I don't think the current supply is certainly keeping up with demand. So, one of the reasons we got in Argentina at the time that we did we really anticipated that the current shortage and supply would have a real impact on prices. So, with respect to our capital budget what we've done is basically limited our capital budget in Argentina to our cash flow and although we're very high on Argentina, I think that's a prudent thing to do in the current environment.
Tom Gardner - Simmons & Company: Got you. And then jumping over to Canada, I'd like to talk specifically about the tapering of your activity and how damaging the royalty changes have been. And then on the other side of the coin the increasing of activity in the Ootla shale play because Ootla qualify as shallow gas or it's does not impacted by that?
Roger Plank: Well, the current structure of the Alberta royalty is both a rate and price curve. And so at lower rates you actually pay a lower rate than you would under the old regime and as you go higher you pay a disproportionate higher price, which is why we curtailed our deeper drilling activities because they generally come on at higher rates. If you get a 5 million a day well for instance, the royalty today in Canada under the new regime is 50%, which seems to absorbent to us, which is why we -- in the lower rates for Alberta to start out at 5% and cross that path at about 220 Mcf a day. In terms of the Ootla shale, I mentioned that we are going to drill nine wells up there with our partner EnCana. We currently are into our winter drilling program. We are drilling three wells right now as we speak and we will put multiple stage fracs on those wells. EnCana should start their drilling momentarily; actually they took one of our rigs and started their drilling program. So, the winter is going to be real important to the Ootla play.
Tom Gardner - Simmons & Company: Following on that path, the Ootla play could you speak to perhaps the anticipated economics as a play or what you are seeing in your first horizontal that has you encouraged anything that you can add there?
Roger Plank: Yeah, the horizontal well that we drilled this last year and we put three fracs on it and if tested came on at $3 million a day and it's been on 10 months and still making over $1 million a day, very good results with very good pressure. The ones that we are drilling today will put at least six individual fracs on and expect a higher initial rate than what we got out of the first horizontal well.
Tom Gardner - Simmons & Company: Where do you hope to get the cost to?
Steve Farris: Well, let's finish drilling our experiment. We have to drill those wells for about $5 million.
Tom Gardner - Simmons & Company: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Ellen Hannan with Bear Sterns. Please go ahead.
Ellen Hannan - Bear Sterns: Good morning. Just a coupe of questions, could you remind us what it is you have targeted for sale in the US?  And the second question I had was, for Steve or Roger. In looking at the development program that you've got to bring on the 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the 2009 - 2011 timeframe. Has your idea or your thoughts on what the capital spending will be required with that, has that changed at all in the current environment?
Steve Farris: The first part of the question was?
Roger Plank: Sales, what was the sales?
Steve Farris: Oh yeah, we have actually closed some at the end of the year and then following it along at the end of it, we've already closed about $250 million worth of sales and have a few pending for another, about a $120 million. Basically it's, either a non-operated or marginal production that we've sold. We sold a little bit of production at Permian basin; we sold a non-focused area for us in North Louisiana. We sold a non-operated field in the Gulf of Mexico and we also sold some non-focus area production, non-operated production in Canada. It's really the tail end of our property. We just that thought it was a good time with prices where they were to turn that into cash.
Roger Plank: And the total was just over 5000 BOE per day I think. It's hard to say.
Steve Farris: Of production.
Ellen Hannan - Bear Sterns.: Okay and then future development cost; has your projection for that changed at all in the current cost environment?
Steve Farris: No, it really hasn't. In fact we put - the numbers that we have down there we feel very comfortable with.
Ellen Hannan - Bear Sterns.: Okay, that's it from me. Thank you.
Roger Plank: Part of the reason is we have contracted for some of those costs. So we kind of lost…
Steve Farris: Certainly on the Pyrenees and the Van Gogh Development we have and a great extent on Reindeer. Obviously Julimar right now is a estimate. But we also maybe estimating higher than what we hopefully anticipated it actually being.
Ellen Hannan - Bear Sterns.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our next question with Ben Dell with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Ben Dell - Bernstein : Hi, guys.
Roger Plank: Hi.
Steve Farris: Good morning.
Ben Dell - Bernstein : I had a couple of questions. First you obviously mentioned the tightening LNG market. In terms of the majors, have you seen them approach you around the world obviously particularly in Egypt and Australia for increments of gas supply for any of the LNG expansions? And if so, are there particular expansion that you can highlight?
Steve Farris: Both in Australia and Egypt we have, we have had discussions with LNG players in that part of the world. And those are ongoing discussions. So and it really is a very good parameter to what you are going to see happening in domestic gas markets around the world because the competition, once you put an LNG facility out there, the competition it's and now it is going offshore, it's going in country. We are seeing that certainly seeing that pressure in Australia and we are also beginning to see that pressure in Egypt.
Ben Dell - Bernstein : Okay, does that make you want to look at areas like other areas of Asia such as Malaysia and Indonesia where there is already LNG schemes in terms of developing incremental gas or accessing licenses or is that not on the radar screen?
Steve Farris: Well it's not on the radar -- Our goal is to develop core areas that have long-term potential. And I am not suggesting that those too don’t but in the areas that were in if you look at our acreage position or you look at our infrastructure position, all of them are sizable and all of them have the potential to continue to grow.
Ben Dell - Bernstein : Okay and just lastly, obviously you’ve been very active in Australia also signing rigs. Are you seeing any sort of weakness in the jack-up market, as these new rigs are added in the Asian region or have you changed your rig signing strategy to just hold off a little bit while they come through?
Steve Farris: Well you're definitely -- internationally you're definitely seeing a small reduction in prices, nothing compared to what you are seeing in North America today but they are definitely starting -- at least currently, they have hit their peak and we’re starting to see lower prices, especially on the jack-up side and especially in the Gulf of Mexico.
Ben Dell - Bernstein : Okay, great, thank you
Operator: And we'll take our next question with Gil Yang with Citi. Please go ahead.
Gil Yang - Citi: Hi, Steve, could you comment on what you expect to happen to Canadian production with the 40% drop in capital spending?
Steve Farris: Yeah and I tried to make sure but I've said that correctly, our overall capital spending in Canada is going to be about flat. What we have done is, redirected our capital spending to other areas. And to speak a little bit to our share play, we have gas plant capacity up there right now, but takeaway capacity is about 25 million a day, which we could increase with some compression. So, all those wells are in a remote area because of some other drilling we've done many years ago. We have some capacity takeaway there. Our budget is basically flat….
Gil Yang - Citi: Production budget?
Steve Farris: Capital budget.
Gil Yang - Citi: But would there be any impact to production because you are maybe spending more money on exploratory longer-term projects?
Steve Farris: Well, I think what you saw in 2007 is probably what you will see in 2008 and that is a little drip down but not dramatic if you understand what I am saying.
Gil Yang - Citi: Yeah, okay. And second question is, you spent $320 million or so in Argentina and you booked 19 million barrels with so pretty high F&D cost. Can you comment on what was going on there, what kind of projects you are investing in, maybe the over the long-term that we didn't see?
Steve Farris: I mean you have got to be careful because you got an awful lot of seismic in that.
Gil Yang - Citi: Okay.
Steve Farris: And I would say the same thing of Canada. We spent almost a $100 million in acreage in Canada last year. So, when you look at the total E&D spend, either in Australia, I mean Argentina or Canada, we had a significant seismic program. We are shooting 680 square kilometers of 3-D seismic right now in (inaudible). And I think we announced our first well, we've made 1600 barrels a day after that 3-D seismic. So, it's paying dividends, but you get a one time hit early on and then you get the benefit of it over the several years.
Gil Yang - Citi: Okay. And so, if you excluded that offer and investment, can you quantify what the F&D would look like?
Steve Farris: I can't, in front of me.
Roger Plank: Well, it's about $15 if you again remove the ARO and the capitalized interest Gill that calculation which I don't think you do.
Gil Yang - Citi: Right. But if you think it…
Roger Plank: What the seismic is, I don't know. But I can get that for you off-line.
Gil Yang - Citi: Okay. Thank you very much.
Roger Plank: Good luck.
Operator: And we'll take our next question with David Heikkinen with Tudor Pickering. Please go ahead.
David Heikkinen - Tudor Pickering: Good morning. Just I wanted to get your CapEx per region?
Roger Plank: For '07 or?
David Heikkinen - Tudor Pickering: '08, what's your target?
Steve Farris: The one thing I would tell you is that when we talk about budgets as I pointed out, we allocate capital quarterly. So, I think Roger has our regional budgets but that is very subject to change.
David Heikkinen - Tudor Pickering: Okay.
Roger Plank: Very much. Well, I mean we look at it every month really and it will depend on what happens to prices, cash flow, economy, all sorts of things. But this is a very tentative budget. But in Argentina we are looking at somewhere around $250 million for the year 2008. The biggest increase is going to be on Australia, it's going to be -- we are looking to something like $900 million versus $400 million for exploration and development. In Chile we got a seismic program so we are slating something like $15 million there. Egypt is also likely to see a meaningful increase in its E&D budget to about three quarter of a $1 billion which is up maybe a 135 from the prior year. North Sea is about flat at five in a quarter. Central is about flat at 650, that's our onshore region basically split between the mid-continent and the Permian. The Gulf is perhaps flat that maybe down a $100 million to $900 million. And Canada as Steve indicated is about flat at about six in a quarter or so.
David Heikkinen - Tudor Pickering: Okay.
Roger Plank: So that should add up to about $4.5 billion or so that we referenced.
David Heikkinen - Tudor Pickering: And then in the Gulf, you did sign up an abandonment plan for the next several years. Is that an internal Apache goal to kind of clean everything up? Or was that MMS mandated? Or how did you push that forward?
Steve Farris: Well, it was really both. I think we are taking an opportunity, a big chunk of that is part of that Grand Isle 40s Complex that BP retained when we bought the Grand Isle 40s Complex; BP retained their obligation for the 37.5% we bought. And we own 37.5%, so if you are speaking to the contract that was out there, the biggest chuck of that is scheduled toward to that Grand Isle 40s Complex.
David Heikkinen - Tudor Pickering: And do you think there will be an uptick kind of industrywide? Are you getting ahead of that before costs start increasing or?
Steve Farris: Well, we really tried to get ahead of it in 2007 as well as working on it in 2008, I doubt if you will see a large increase in 2008 over our activity in 2007.
David Heikkinen - Tudor Pickering: Okay. And then just trying to, the Alpha platform going off-line in the second quarter in the North Sea, how long do you have that in your budget for it to be off-line and how much production would you expect to be off-line?
Steve Farris: Well, we project it's going to about 4,000 barrels a day for the quarter. But the platform will be down. I think we're scheduled it to be down for 13 days.
David Heikkinen - Tudor Pickering: 13 days. Thanks a lot guys. That's all I had.
Steve Farris: Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question with Joe Allman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Joe Allman - JP Morgan: Hi, everybody.
Steven Farris: Good morning.
Joe Allman - JP Morgan: What are the plans in terms of your excess cash flow? Any specific targets for US dollars?
Steven Farris: Well, as Raymond Plank always likes to point out is, if we really ever end up with excess cash flow, it would surprise us. We generally find things to do with it. The other thing I would say about that is that we've got in front of us and I think Ellen pointed that future development capital that we have in some of our major projects, those numbers add up to be over $2 billion net to Apache. So, we have uses, may not be short-term uses but we have long-term usage for our cash.
Joe Allman - JP Morgan: In terms of opportunity to make acquisitions, are you looking at significant acquisitions at this point or do you plan to look at significant acquisitions in 2008?
Steven Farris: I think hopefully you've got to feel that we've evolved in such position with the asset base that we built. We intend to grow organically and that does not mean we would make an acquisition. Certainly we are an acquisitive company. We look at things that fit us, that are in areas that we want to be. The acquisition market is pretty floppy right now and so we're certainly not looking at anything in a major acquisition way. We always look for things that tag on to what we're doing.
Joe Allman - JP Morgan: Got it, that’s helpful. And then, I heard you talk about the rig rates softening a little bit internationally. Could you talk about other drilling complete cost? Do you see them still softening and can you give us specifics on that?
Steven Farris: I think probably everybody is aware of Schlumberger's comment since I'm not commenting just on Slumber Jay but there is absolutely no doubt that with all the new equipment and what's happened in Alberta, North American cost, service cost are coming down. And we see that in rig rates and we also see that in primary services. Internationally, there are still very active programs going on in the world. We've seen [CMIs] coming down somewhat but certainly not the levels that percentage drops, if you are seeing for jack-ups and Gulf of Mexico or land rigs in the U.S.
Joe Allman - JP Morgan: Okay, it's helpful. And then Roger just real quick; I missed some of your comments on the LOE. Could you again just give us the specifics why the LOE was up in the fourth quarter and why it's not going to be up to that degree on a unit basis in 2008?
Roger Plank: Well, one reason was we had work over activity that was $0.09 of the increase and then -- I mean, I don't know whether it will go up or not but things that we need to adjust for the foreign exchange impact that was $0.18 of the increase, lingering hurricane repairs, which hopefully will die down here with $0.12, and then incentive based or stock-based compensation expense was $0.30, which happens when our stock goes up. And I think we closed the quarter at $107 of change though that was a big number at that point. But depending on what happens in those particular areas that will drive the direction of the rate to some extent in the future.
Steve Farris:  We'd expect the stock to be huge this year.
Joe Allman - JP Morgan: Yes. We'll model that. And then just lastly in terms of your budget for cost are you budgeting lower costs or you being conservative in budgeting kind of flat or slightly up cost?
Roger Plank: Well, we budget for spots on the map. And all of the capital that we've allocated right now are for projects that either have an AFE on them or a real estimate of cost. So, the thing I think you're going to see is we're going to be able to drill more wells with the same amount of money.
Joe Allman - JP Morgan: Got you. Okay, very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We'll take our next question with Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead sir.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets: Hey, good afternoon here guys. A couple of quick questions here for you. On the Australian gas prices, obviously, you guys are having uplift here in the fourth quarter. Curious if you could, maybe quantify for us one some of your existing contracts roll off, I don't know, if there is a way to break this up into kind of percentages in the next couple of years because clearly there could be upside from re-contracting I guess?
Roger Plank: I think we've about three quarters of our gas that will roll off in the 2010 to 2015 period. And so we'll have to see what kind of price we can get when that happens. Frankly, we might just contract with the same users that we've now. But just have a change in prices, as the market directs. But we'll have one contract that you may be familiar with (inaudible) that would extend beyond that period. So, roughly the $200 million that we've contracted today about three quarters of it, a little loss in beginning in 2010 through '015.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Also in Australia you guys reported a very robust oil price in the fourth quarter. I was curious, if there was anything sort of going on there that was unique to one of us?
Steve Farris: We've seen the price of Tapas become very robust because it's in the Asian markets and it kind of premium crude. So, we've been benefiting from that. As I recall, we said that last quarter as well. So it's just selling at a premium to WTI.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Switching over to Argentina real quick here, it looks like your gas productions kind of been down for the past couple of quarters. If that not at all, whether there are going to be an area of focus, you're spending more time drilling for well down there and your programs. Just trying to get a sense of what we should expect to the next couple of quarters there?
Steve Farris: Yeah. The biggest impact is not the capability of the wells. The biggest impacts has pipeline takeaway capacity up north, and also the limit of selling gas across to Chile. And so, what will happen to do is re-inject that gas and skip the liquid that's not a performance issue that's more of a market issue.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thanks a lot guys.
Steve Farris: Thank you.
Roger Plank: I might just say one thing about that, we did, as Steve indicated we saw our price improved to $60 I guess for the quarter which was very nice increase. The way the market works over there we must deliver a certain volume of gas roughly 145 million cubic feet a day at a fixed price. So, when we bring on incremental gas then we can go after the kind of market that Steve was talking about $3 contract type price. So, as far you can make economics at these prices really it will be a blend of the old price from the new but to the extent we bring on incremental production, we'll get a free market price that has been $2.5 and $3.5 in Mcf. So, I think our guys are still planning to drill a number of gas wells because of that net aspect of it.
Steve Farris: Yeah. The primary drilling for gas right now at least will be in the neck and the primary drilling for oil will be in TDS.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we have no further questions. I'd like to turn it back over to Mr. Dye for any additional or closing remarks.
Bob Dye: Thanks for tuning in. Roger and I are going to head up fairly soon to the First Boston Conference in Colorado. So, you should probably direct your questions this afternoon to Dave Higgins and his number is 713-296-6690. Again, thanks for joining us.
Operator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Apache Corporation thirdquarter earnings 2007 conference call. Today's presentation will be hosted by Mr. Bob Dye, Vice President ofInvestor Relations. Mr. Dye, please goahead.
Bob Dye: Thanks for joining us today. This morning Apache Corporationreleased third quarter 2007 results which reported earnings per share of $1.83. I think most of you saw the $1.83 numberincluded a $0.34 non-cash charge, primarily related to the impact of foreigncurrency fluctuations on our deferred tax balances. Without that, our adjusted earnings were$2.17 per share. Cash flow reach an all-timerecord of $1.6 billion which is a non-GAAP number. Today’s discussion may contain forward-looking estimates andassumptions and no assurances can be given that those expectations will berealized. A full disclaimer is locatedon our website at www.apachecorp.com.  In addition, any non-GAAP number that we discuss will beidentified as such with the reconciliation also located on our website. Steve Farris, our CEO and Roger Plank, ourCFO will now make prepared remarks prior to taking questions. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Farris: Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks forjoining us today. Apache’s performancein the third quarter was outstanding. It was driven by our portfolio balance,quality and depth of our growth opportunities. Third quarter production, as I am sure you have read, was 516,000barrels of oil equivalent a day which was 9% year-on-year growth and just underour all-time record set in the previous quarter.  Henry Hub spot gas prices were down 17% on an average in thethird quarter compared to the second quarter. Differentials meant that as an industry, many people saw $3 gas in the Rockies. On the flip side, the average WTI oil price increase 16%from the second quarter. The average oilprice I am quoting is about $75 and hence, doesn’t really reflect the morerecent strong rise in oil prices.  In this volatile commodity setting, our average realizationswere stable for the quarter and cash flow of $1.6 billion set an all-timequarterly record, which was 25% year-over-year growth and 10% relative to thesecond quarter of 2007. That is largely on the strength of our commoditybalance. Liquids production accounts for47% of our production by volume, but accounted for 67% of our revenues duringthe quarter. As Bob pointed out, net income was again impacted by a weakeningU.S. dollar that requires us to mark-to-market our non-cash differed taxbalances denominated in foreign currencies. Without this charge, earnings wouldhave been $2.17 per share.  Times like this underline the competitive advantage thatApache’s balanced portfolio represents. We have a one of the largest North American gas portfolios in theindustry with over 5 Tcf in proved gas reserves as well as in excess of 20 Tcfof unrisked resource potential. ButApache is really much more than that: a balanced upstream company with almosthalf of our production being oil.  We are also balanced geographically. Within our gas portfoliowe do not rely solely on North America and have verymaterial and profitable growth areas in Australiaand Egypt plusan early stage position in Argentina. We remain very well-positioned to achieve thetop end of our 9% to 12% production growth target for 2007. During the first three quarters of 2007,production was up 13% over the comparable period in 2006 and so we are well onour way.  If you look out little further, we have guided so far to a 6%to 10% production growth in 2008 with an additional 108,000 barrels of oil equivalentof production coming online in late 2008, 2009 and 2010 from six large projects.We are more confident than ever that our resource base can generatedouble-digit growth into the next decade. I would like to begin the regional comments with Australia,which is one of the three core growth areas for Apache. I want to focus primarily on our activitiesin the very prolific Carnarvon Basin, which is offshore Western Australia. Wehave an extensive acreage position of 5.4 million acres and control of Varanus Island, which is an importantinfrastructure hub.  During the quarter, we announced two major gas discoveriesoffshore Western Australia. First in July, we found 224 feet of net gas pay in the JulimarEast prospect with 85 million a day of production flow. The net pay is nearly double what we found inour Julimar discovery in April and we are own 65% of this block. Second in August we found 121 feet of net pay in Brunello no.1 with production tests flowing about 72.5 million a day and 1,230 barrels ofcondensate, we own 65% and operate this also.  With the three discoveries so far this year of Julimar,Julimar East and Brunello we have found a gas resource with ultimate potentialin excess of 1.3 Tcf of gas in Australia alone which is close to 1 Tcf net tous, and this is exiting considering this represents about 150% of ourproduction last year and coming from a single country in our portfolio. We will be limited this year on reservebookings to the wells that we have down but by themselves those wells will makethis project commercial.  We drilled two additional prospects during the quarter atRosella and Maitland, one worth promising results. Maitland is a known gas accumulation. Wedrilled the first horizontal well there which started producing substantialsand as we increased the flow rate. Weneed to drill another horizontal well really with the right sand control, butwe remain optimistic that the field will be economic.  Rosella was somewhat disappointing as our maximum flow ratewas less than 10 million a day. We arecurrently doing petrophysical analysis to better understand the reservoir. We have two additional appraisal wells leftto drill this year at Julimar and one more expiration target called Norville. We hope to drill this wells in the fourth quarter of 2007, however lastweekend the rig had an electrical fire in the engines and the early assessment isit will be offline for four to six weeks. We still should get some drilling in for the remainder of the year.  In 2008, we will begin our exploration campaign in theGippsland basin. We have identified 12drillable prospects with reserve sizesranging from 50 million to 100 million barrels.  I’d like to give you a little update on our developmentprojects in Western Australia. During the third quarter we sanctioned the Pyrenees oil projectwhich together with Van Gogh will give us 40,000 barrels a day net toApache. Van Gogh is scheduled to come onlinein early 2009 with Pyrenees coming on at the tail end ofthat year. This is the equivalent of 15%of our current worldwide oil production.  In August, with our partner Santos,we initiated the engineering design phase of our Reindeer gas project which willmonetize between 416 bcf gas with an initial production target of 100 million aday which is expected to come on line in 2010. We own 55% of this project and operate it.  In addition, we’ve begun the preliminary engineering phaseto develop Julimar [Permel] that is expected to have initial production ofapproximately 300 million a day starting at late 2010 of which 65% will be oursand we will operate it.  I would like to talk briefly about the economics of our gasin Western Australia. We built our major acreage and productionposition in this area during the last ten years, when domestic gas prices havebeen in $1 to $2 range. Our returns havebeen very attractive at those levels with rates of return averaging about 25%over the last three years.  We identified the resource potential early and the profitabilityof applying our operator skills, so we went in early and built theportfolio. We’ve been able to achievevery acceptable returns in a less than better market but the upside is now infront of us. Western Australia’s economy is growing led by large andlong-term mining project and needs natural gas. As a result, gas prices are converging with international levels. This summer, a large supply contract wasclosed at $7.50 per M, and that is 3 to 4 times our historic levels.  We are currently in discussions with a large contract forReindeer development gas volumes and I’d like to say that the pricing levels weare seeing are consistent with these recent references. Obviously, this is very good news for ourshare holders.  We’re becoming increasingly encouraged that our bet oninternational gas prices is paying off for our shareholders not only in Australiabut also in Egyptand Argentina. Each area was out of favor when we entered,and were able to generate acceptable returns in the face of depressed orregulated prices. Now we’re beginning to see signs that the gas prices in thosecountries will converge with international levels also.  Other competitors are trying to build positions, obviouslyat higher costs, but we also already have a lot of depth in our portfolio. This is true organic value creation byApache.  I’d like to turn now to Egypt.We took many important steps forward in Egyptin the third quarter across our primary growth drivers of exploration drilling,gas plant expansions and water flood developments. During the quarter, we madetwo discoveries, drilled one successful appraisal well and 26 developmentwells. Our successful wells are reallytoo numerous to mention individually but I do want to comment on this morning’srelease.  North of Khalda we have made several Jurassic discoveries onour 250,000 acreMatruh concession including a field called Imhotep and also Jade. The Jade 2x appraisal well that we announcedthis morning was drilled on the Jade Ridge which is on the Western flank of theMatruh concession . It was drilled specifically to test the AB formation.  We found a 148 feet of AEB pay inthe wells which flowed 27 million a day and about 1,325 barrels of condensateof test. The Jade 1x discovery well which is currently producing from theJurassic formation also logged 217 feet of pay in the AEB. The Jade 4X appraisal well,another well we just got down, an AEB test logged 234 feet of pay in the AEB and willcompleted as soon as the Jade 2x is finished. The Imhotep Field is 17 miles east of the Jade Ridge on theEastern flank of the Matruh concession, and we recently recompleted the Imhotep2 into the AEB and have tested 4,082 barrels a day of condensate and 3.3million cubic feet of gas. I might add that AEB formation has produced 40% of the 250million barrel liquid production in the greater Khalda area, which is directlysouth of our Matruh concession. We arevery encouraged by the results of the Jade Ridge and as many you may know, thisis one of our significant expiration targets that we put on the books tobeginning of the year.  Our Salam gas plant expansion projects remains on schedulefor completion in the fourth quarter of 2008. This project is projected to add an additional 90 million a day and 4,500barrels of condensate net to Apache.  At the end of the third quarter, Apache had gross productionof 33,000 barrels a day coming from its new waterflood projects which is ontrack with the estimates presented in our June analyst conference.  We drilled 36 wells and six different waterflood projectsand increased water injection capacity 45% to 42,000 barrel a day. We will continue our aggressive developmentfor the next several years to realize our associated 200 million barrel lowrisk reserve potential. Our position in Egyptis one of the largest of any western companies in the Middle Eastwhich is central to the future of energy industry. Moreover our position has grown at double-digitrates for ten years and it has an extraordinary depth of growth opportunities. I’ll turn now to Canada. Our Canadian portfolio gives us a trulyoutstanding scale of resource potential in shale gas, coal bed methane and highimpact deep exploration drilling. The third quarter performance againunderlines the strength of this portfolio, with Apache Canada delivering steadyproduction in spite of a capital spending cut of 30% lower than last year.  The proposed royalty increase in Albertais currently formulated. It would have a negative impact for 2008 developmentdrilling program in that province. Rates of return of some of our gas drillingprogram would decline below 10% and will definitely have an impact on our 2008spending levels in Alberta.  I might point out that this is the type of development whichmakes Apache’s portfolio depth and balance invaluable. For example, in Northeast BCwhich is not affected by the proposed fiscal change in Alberta,we have an aggressive appraisal program planned this winter at our shale gasplay. Apache now controls, with ourpartner in Canada,400,000 gross, 200,000 net acres to us, enough to potentially drill 1,200 netwells at four wells per section. We plan to drill and complete nine horizontal wells thiswinter, which should allow us to develop a firm view of the play’s potential,using a variety of fracture stimulation programs along with micro seismic andlistening well data. We intend to construct an all-weather road and expandpipeline and compression facilities there. We are optimistic that this playwill be a significant contributor to the future growth of not only the region,but also Apache, with 3 to 6 Tcf of resource potential. Turning to the U.S.and our Central Region., our Central Region has twogrowth engines, the Anadarko Basintight gas and the Permian Basinoil and they both continue to power here. Production reached an all-time record of 304 million cubic feet of gas aday and 39,200 barrels of oil per day during the quarter. Production was up 21% year on year drivenlargely by our active drilling program there, which continues into the fourthquarter with 16 rigs.  In the Gulf region, we continue to have a steady generationof cash from our Gulf Region from very strong production. Well production reached an all time high of 57,900barrels a day during the quarter, which was driven by restoration activitiesand a successful drilling program.  Our gas volumes were below all-time records in secondquarter of 2007 due to really to two independent reasons. One was pipeline shut-ins,which was about half of it, and the other one had to do with depletion. I amhappy to report that we restored all production from the storms in 2005. Apache continues to benefit from falling rig rates in theregion. Jack-up rates have fallen roughly 50% this year for all sizes, andbarge rigs are down 15%. Our onshore Gulf Coast portfolio was bolsteredsignificantly during the quarter with a large farm-in arrangement from[Innervest], which allow us to explore nearly 400,000 acres in Central Texas.  Now turning to our smallest and newest component of ourportfolio Argentina.Within a year it’s given us attractive returns and resource upside andsurprisingly price upside at this early stage. We have reduced our percentage of gas sold at subsidized prices as ofOctober 1st and this is a slight delay on the original time line ofimplementation which was supposed have been sometime during the thirdquarter. The delay was driven by one ofthe coldest winters on record in the country however. We ran seven rigs duringthe quarter and drilled 28 wells.  I will turn now lastly to the North Sea. In the North Sea, wecompleted two excellent producing wells, the Bravo 63 is currently producing65,000 barrels a day and the Bravo 32 well is producing 34,000 barrels aday. As you reported and as you saw onour numbers in the second quarter conference call, we report that we were goingto take the Alpha and Echo platforms down for maintenance turnarounds duringthe third quarter which ended up costing us about 9,700 barrels a day for thethird quarter.  The work accomplished during the turnarounds is reallybeyond the scope of the call, but I might say we replaced or inspected orinstalled over 200 vessels during a 30 day period that required 18,000 manhours of labor. As we near thecompletion of the topside refurbishment program and focus on productiondrilling we are setting ourselves up for an outstanding fourth quarter withproduction in the range of 60,000 barrels a day net to Apache. Remember the 40’s contains 450 millionbarrels of net resource and every additional percentage of reserve recoverygives us 50 million of light oil reserves.  That concludes my operational update. Now I would like toturn it over to Roger Plank, Apache’s CFO and Executive Vice President for afinancial update.
Roger Plank: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon everyone. Themerits of Apache's balanced global strategy was evidenced in our strong thirdquarter results. Rising oil prices had an outsized impact on our bottom-lineresults given that oil figures so prominently in our production mix. As a result, while many North American gas orientedcompanies wrestled with nearly $1.50 sequential decline in NYMEX gas prices a$10 per barrel increase and the benchmark price of oil on strong productiondrilled Apache's oil revenue up $150 million sequentially during the quarter,enabling total revenue to reach the $2.5 billion mark for the first time in ourhistory.  Earnings of $612 million or $1.83 a share where also quitestrong, especially when taking into consideration the $114 million non-cashcharge related to the impact of the deteriorating U.S. dollar on Canadian and foreigndeferred tax balances. Theoretically, when it comes time to pay our defer taxes in Canadait will take more US dollars to do so. So, we have to reflect that change in our income statement at the end ofeach quarter and frankly it’s kind of pain rear as it significantly distortsour true performance.  The important thing to note is while this reportingconvention reflects the proper accounting treatment for movement in foreigncurrency, it is just a non-cash change and not a current period economic event.Therefore, setting aside the impact of the changes in foreign currency, Apacheearnings did total of $2.17 per share substantially Street expectations. It is also well ahead of both last quarterand third quarter of ’06 earnings which excluding the impact of foreigncurrency fluctuations and other non-recurring items totaled $2.09 and $1.70 pershare. If you are interested the [inaudible]lays out those adjustments so that you can see each of the components.  The strength of our quarter is readily apparent in our cashflow from operations which being unaffected by this foreign exchange fluctuationreached a record $1.6 billion or $4.83 of share, up 25% from last year’s thirdquarter; 10% higher than the second quarter of this year and well ahead of consensusestimates as well. Again, the strong results speak to the benefit of a balancedportfolio approach. I can’t tell you hownice it is for our liquid hydrocarbons -- roughly half of our quarter’s production-- to generate just over two-thirds of our total revenue.  Revenues are the beneficiary of higher oil prices of lateand while the weaker US dollar generates the deferred tax amount we projectthat we may pay someday there is little question that this currency weakness isalso benefiting Apache in the form of higher oil prices. From that standpoint, Apache has a naturaloffset which mitigates the income statement impact resulting from the weakerdollar. As Steve indicated, our third quarter production was up 9%year over year; it was down 2% quarter over quarter while the slight decline inthird quarter production may have surprised some of you, it was relativelyconsistent with our internal expectations due to the anticipation of thescheduled turnaround in the North Sea which is why we do continue to expectyear-over-year production growth at the upper end of our 9% to 12% growth range.  If you do the math, to reach the upper end implies significantgrowth in the fourth quarter which we fully expect will enable us to close outthe year with our highest production level ever. We also anticipate continued strong returnsdriven by robust margins, the impacted strong global demand and limitedsupplies on oil prices fueled Apache’s highest cash and pre-tax marginsyear-to-date despite realizing the lowest gas prices of the year and fightingour industry’s ongoing battle with rising costs.  For the quarter, overall cash costs dropped 1% to $13.55 perboe and combined with 3% higher realizations, propelled margins up 5% from lastquarter to $34.83 per boe, our highest year-to-date. Even including DD&A, our total pre-taxmargin increased to $22.72 per boe from $21.40 sequentially.  Focusing on costs, our third quarter lifting costs increased2% or $0.17 of boe sequentially to $8.21 per boe. Roughly half of this increase was related to expandedworkover activity to increase production on the Anadarko acquired propertiesand the other half relates to the lower North Sea volumeswhich as you’ve heard, are forecasted to recover in the fourth quarter.  I also note that the quarter included $0.09 related to theforeign exchange movement and absent fee impacts, LOE per boe would have beenaround $8 which is a level we consider achievable going forward, even withcontinuing higher work over activity.  G&A costs dropped 13% sequentially to a $1.19 per boe,probably a good rate, achievable rate going forward. Full cost DD&A was up just 2%sequentially to $10.94 per boe as drilling costs continue above historicallevels. Severance and other taxes of$2.42 a boe decreased $0.10 quarter over quarter. This is primarily driven bylower North Sea PRT as lower volumes more than offset higher oil prices.  Financing expense decreased $0.05 to a $1.17 per boe on $126million lower debt. Continued strong oil prices and rising production shouldresult in further debt as well as debt to cap reductions from the 25% rate thatwe ended third quarter at.  Our effective tax rate was 48% for the third quarter, thelingering effect of exchange rate fluctuations and further currency weakeningso far this quarter should cause our fourth quarter effective rate to remain ataround the same level and portion that is deferred should move to around52%.  Fortunately, the costs start over every January 1st, soabsent further FX changes next year’s rateshould be back below 40%.  Before closing, I’d like to underscore that not only are wegratified with Apache’s third quarter results, but we also look forward to avery strong finish to our year for good reason. First, solid fourth quarter production will contribute to double-digitgrowth year-over-year and our 28th increase in the last 29 years.  Second, despite concerns over the USeconomy, Apache is among those multinational companies benefiting from strongglobal demand for our product. While itis too early to know exactly where prices will shakeout for the quarter,current WTI oil prices are again over $10 higher than the third quarter NYMEXaverage of $75 per barrel. With 7,000 barrel per day of old hedges rolling off thismonth in October, where the prices was capped $39.25 or less than the half thecurrent price, approximately 85% of Apache’s oil production is now unhedged andenjoying the price run up toward $90 perbarrel.  In addition, our lowest gas price hedges rolled off inOctober. Some 90 million cubic feet perday capped at $6.32 per MMBTU leaving only around 15% of our total gas hedgedas we head into the winter demand season.  Finally, today’s cover article, some of you may have noticedin the Wall Street Journal mention price controls in Argentina.I would add and as Steve has indicated, Argentinahas begun to take steps towards that with respect to natural gas we’re startingto see the benefit of that. Thus far into fourth quarter Apache’s averagingjust over $1.40 per MCF on 200 million cubic feet of gas per day and that’s 40% or so higher than what weactually received in the third quarter.  So in a nutshell, the combination of rising production andprospects for strong product prices should enable continued attractive -- oreven improving -- margins resulting in a very strong finish to 2007. 
Steve Farris : Thank you, Roger. I might just close with a fewcomments. The third quarter was outstandingfor Apache both financially and operationally. Cash flow set records, we had outstanding earnings. Operationally, our evolving high impactexploration portfolio in our core growth areas, resulted in two natural gasdiscoveries in Australiaand a gas condensate discovery in Egypt.In Canada we addedabout 104,000 gross 52,000 net acres to our British Columbian shale gasresource play, and now control over 400,000 gross, 200,000 net. We look forward to testing the viability ofthis play with the drill bit during the winter campaign. Our portfolio balance has shown through in our commodity mixas Roger pointed out, liquids which account for half of our production generatedtwo-thirds of our revenues, and that should continue into the fourth quarter. We should exit the year with a rising production profile andshould end the year on the high end of our range and with development projectsunderway scheduled to add 108,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over thenext three years fueling our growth. Ourresource base is capable of delivering strong growth through the end of thedecade.  With that we would love to take your questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from Ben Dell - Bernstein.
Ben Dell - Bernstein: Myfirst question is really around reserve bookings. You outlined a number of your discoveries,there are obviously timing issues in terms of when you book those. Last year your F&D in the US was a particular drag. Do yousee that coming down this year or your overall F&D declining this yearversus last year?
Steve Farris: Finding cost? Well, we still got a quarter to go and ourreservoir engineers haven’t told me what the numbers are yet. I will tell you this; the thing that is goingto affect our finding cost in the U.S. this year is same that’s affected themin last year, that is we still have an awful lot of the hurricane damage thatwe put in this year which was really as we pointed out last year, was reallythe impactful thing in the United States.
Ben Dell - Bernstein: Maybe turning over to Argentina,can you give some color, and you obviously mentioned the collar on the gasmarket there. With the elections comingup, do you have a feel for what sort of escalation in gas prices you could seeover the next two, three years as the market tightens?
Steve Farris: Well, everything I am going to tell you is obviously what --as I always mention we go into new country we are their guest, and they are thehost. There is a lot of anticipation that the new administration is going to atleast relook at that issue. I will giveyou some anecdotal comments about that though. We recently entered into athree-year contract with a major gas user there that’s in other parts of theworld. In the three years they are at 15million a day and they go from $3 to $3.50 to $3.90 over the next threeyears. So we are seeing, already we’re seeingactually more than I anticipated when we got in there at this point oftime.  I don’t think that’s going to change as you I am sure youare aware. They need indigenous gas terribly. They import 250 million a day from Boliviaat over $6 now. I am hopeful that everybody is reasonable about the way youattract foreign investment and part ofthat is that you have to make a return and in order to do that, you have tohave acceptable prices.  So I can’t forecast. I can tell you what we’ve been able to do lately, but in terms of ourexpectations I think our expectations are pretty optimistic, frankly.
Roger Plank:  The other thing I would add to that is, the article in thepaper implies everything is regulated and priced and gas is too, but it isreally the residential market and some of the small usage markets that areregulated, and it is certainly low price, but they also recognize that they arerunning out of gas. They have to import it, like Steve says, at $6 so they havelet incremental gas sell for whatever the market will bear.  So once we have delivered into the lower priced, regulatedmarkets then we can go after these markets that Steve just indicated where weare seeing prices at $3 or triple what we got last quarter. So they have the right ingredients in place and they havethe right mindset; people who bring on new gas will get rewarded with higherprice.
Ben Dell - Bernstein: Just one last quick one. On Enesco’s call today theysuggested the demand for jackups in the Gulf of Mexicois picking up and highlighted yourselves as one of the key players coming backto the market. Can you give us an indicationon what your rig demand in the Gulf will be next year versus this year?
Steve Farris: I think they are hopeful. I will leave it at that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer -Goldman Sachs : When you look at your Australiagas exploration program can you talk to where you stand on prospect inventoryand how aggressively should we expect gas exploration to be in ‘08, givenwhat’s going on?
Steve Farris: We will have a very active program. We have a number ofother prospects on the block 356; we have a block that is north of our old EastBar which is a field that made about 750 Bcf of gas, it is west of Varanus Island that we are going todrill. We have Norbo which we are goingto drill. We have a number of additionalprospects in the Carnarvon Basinto drill next year.  I guess you are asking the potential of the market or thepotential of our gas resource base?
Brian Singer -Goldman Sachs : Really just the potential of the gas resource base and howaggressively you plan to drill that in ’08 versus your program in ’07?
Steve Farris: Well I actually I think we have two rigs running next year.I will tell you it is difficult to get a rig into the Carnarvon Basin and I will give you the firewe just had. It will be December beforewe get another rig into the Carnarvon Basin because they have safetycases that a new rig has to go through.  We think there is about 2.2 billion barrels of resourcepotential that we have in front of us of exploration stuff. The beauty of wherewe are right now is if you look at Julamar Brunello which we believe iscommercial as it sits; and our Reindeer, our only downside is not getting thatdone and executed. Because as you knowonce you get infrastructure and you can look for lesser and lesser sizedreserves or add-ons to the infrastructure. So we will have a very aggressive program in the Carnarvon Basin on thegas side next year as we will and in the [Gypsum] Basin starting about Februarywith one jackup coming in there.
Brian Singer -Goldman Sachs : In the U.S.were there any intricacies of oil production being up relative to the secondquarter with the gas production being down a bit? Anything you need to sharethere?
Steve Farris: You mean in the gas production in the Gulf of Mexico? 
Brian Singer -Goldman Sachs : Yes.
Steve Farris: We were down about 40 million a day and about 20 million ofthat was strictly facility related or pipeline related; 20 million a day ofit. A little bit of it was weather and thepart was natural declines. Quite franklywe’re expecting a little uptick on our gas production for the fourth quarterand our oil production should be about flat to up a little bit.
Operator: We’ll go next to Tom Gardner - Simmons.
Tom Gardner - Simmons: Good afternoon, guys. Given the continued success you are having in Egypt,particularly in the Khalda concession, at what point does it make sense to takeanother look at your gross gas processing plants and perhaps revising thoseupward?
Steve Farris: Well we have two plants that are going to come on startingin the fourth quarter of 2008 which is about 200 million a day of processingcapacity. I will say that we had abigger appetite than that. We go throughthe operating companies, each company in Egypthas an operating company that is owned 50% by the foreign contractor and 50% bythe EGPC which is the government arm of the oil industry. It would not surprise me at all for us to bestarting discussions in earnest on drilling, at least filling one more 100 Mcf trainsometime in the next year. They aregoing to need the gas, and we have to take away capacity.
Roger Plank: The other thing we have an arrangement where we move gasthrough another operator’s plant that supplied basically by one field that hasbeen depleting. To the extent that, thatgas isn’t replaced that frees up room for more Apache gas into the future. 
Steve Farris: To be a little more specific, we take about a 150 million aday of our gas out of Cosor, North to a field called Obiat that has a 380million a day gas plant. Obiat has beenonline for a number of years and continues to decline so to the extent they declineour gas rates will go up through there also.
Tom Gardner - Simmons: To be clear, this 100 million a day that you speak of , isthat incremental to these 700 million gross?
Steve Farris: That would be, yes sir.
Tom Gardner - Simmons: Jump over to the North Sea, you continueto have success there as you mentioned in the Bravo well, I guess appropriately named. Some people arepulling out of the North Sea, I just want to get yourthoughts on the UKnatural gas market perhaps consolidation opportunities in your capital spendingplans there going forward?
Steve Farris: We continue to put together exploration projects but our mainconcern frankly right now is to get 40’s up and running because if you look atthe fields in the North Sea I think the 40’s field is either the second orthird largest field still in the UKNorth Sea and if you consider that and we are seriously believe there isanother 450 million barrel resource potential there it would rival any field thathas been found. Our immediate goal is tomake sure we make that run everyday and I think we are later than what Ianticipated but I think we are pretty close to be in there.  With respect to the gas markets, I mean with the UnitedStates Bank, they had a psychedelic ride, I mean they have gone through one ofthe most aggregated volatile markets. It went from sometimes over $20 to $4 to$3. Frankly I think that gas market willcontinue to be tremendously volatile in the UK for the very reason that I thinkit’s going to be somewhat volatile in United States and that is they have to importtheir commodity and that has to do, as gas becomes more and more worldwide thegas is going to find the place that is going to pay a nice price because oncethey get on the water in the LNG they are going to the highest priced gasmarket.  So in terms of our future on the gas side, I think thatdepends on how other people look at it, because at $86 a barrel the things thatwe have seen that have come through have been pretty high priced.  We certainly didn’t get into the North Seajust on 40’s however. So we are veryhigh on the potential of the North Sea and things thatwe know how to do very well.
Tom Gardner - Simmons: one last question with respect to Australia. I just want to get an idea of to what degreeyou are able to manage those higher spot prices? How much of your gas is termedout and when does that come open for free negotiation? Then the growthcomponent on top of that, what does that look like relative to what you areproducing today?
Steve Farris: We have about 40% of our gas that is going to come off, 40%to 50% of our gas is going to start coming off 2009 and 2010; our existinggas. 
Tom Gardner - Simmons: Meaning come out of contract?
Steve Farris: Yes, come out of contracts. The real demand for gas today in Australiabesides the rollover contracts that we will obviously try to renew are the hard metals that you are seeing in the restof the world, if you look at the copper prices or anything, steel prices. Thereare a number of new mining plants going in on the western side of Australiato capture that price for minerals. If youlooked at a demand curved in Australiaover the next five to six years, it is not unlike the demand curve you see in Egyptwhich is about 12% per year.  Our honest Achilles Heel is we have to get these projectsdone, and it is not an Achilles Heel, but our future is in front of us if wecan take advantage of it. We have the closest, we have the gas that can get tomarket in the near term. We had a tender, we had 23 expressions of interest forgas, so there is definitely a demand for gas, and there will be an advance forgas. I don’t know if you read some ofthe information that comes out of the Western Australian government, they areconcerned about natural gas starting in 2009, 2010.
Tom Gardner - Simmons: Is Apache being aggressive in going after that market thengoing forward?
Steve Farris: Yes sir. I might add to that again I want to make sure Imade my point as I made it. Our Reindeergas we are into the engineering design and it should come on in 2010. We justended a tender process where we were asking for interested parties to submitindications of interest by last week Friday. We got 23 indications of interest; now obviously we are going to picktwo or three and deal with them, but their appetite was overwhelming.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jack Hayden – PritchardCapital. 
Jack Hayden –Pritchard Capital : A couple of quick questions. First on the tax rate issue youtalked about Q4 tax rate being about the same as Q3 assuming you report it the same way,stripping out the forex impact, where would you expect the tax rate to shakeout?  Can you give some additional detail on what you have goingon in the Canadian shale play? If possible, some results from these couple of wellsdrilled and a little color on the depths, targeted well costs, anything likethat?
Roger Plank: Regarding the tax rate, I think I got the gist of what youare asking. There has been furtherdeterioration in the fourth quarter. Sothe number that I gave before or the comment I made before that the fourthquarter rate, although it would be comparable to the third quarter rate of 48%is taking into consideration that deterioration in the U.S. dollar that we’veseen so far in this quarter. So if thereis no further deterioration from here we still ought to have a rate of about48%. Does that answer your question?
Jack Hayden –Pritchard Capital : No. You had 48% but you stripped out components as unusual dueto the forex change, which got the tax rate down to about 38% ex that. So assuming you considered the forex impact inQ4 again to be kind of unusual, should we expect a recurring tax rate of about38% again?
Roger Plank: Our natural un-foreign currency changes, tax rate of 38%,39% something like that. Now, but to get there we have to go through year endbecause of the changes that have takenplace so far that the impact is blended throughout all the quarters ahead of you. So you won’t see that until next year. If you know what I am saying. We have acarryforward of that impact from the change in the foreign currency year todate.
Steve Farris: The clock starts over January 1st and so it would takeanother currency move like the one we have seen to drive rates next year up tothat mid to high 40% range.
Roger Plank: So far,I mean it’s been a $0.15 move from start of the year to the current timeframeso that would be another huge move. Well we’ll just see, but hopefully with theclock starting over we will be back below 40% next year.
Steve Farris: The question on the shale, you're exactly correct. Actually,we have four wells in the shale, two vertical wells and two horizontal wells.One of the horizontal wells I would describe as actually legitimately testingin a play the way we will this winter. We put three fracs on a well; obviouslythe next well we'll probably put seven or eight fracs on it.  We're very encouraged by the results of that well. The ratewas about commensurate with a three frac well. The decline curve has not beennearly as steep as we anticipated. It has been actually tremendous; it hasdeclined but it's been a tremendously shallow decline. We're designing fracs.We'll probably do two or three different kind of fracs in the wells that we'regoing to drill this year. But between us and EnCana, our partner, we'll end updrilling nine wells this year.  We have 400,000 acres under lease of which we own 50% across-the-boardand EnCana owns 50%.
Operator:  We'll go next to JohnHerrlin with Merrill Lynch.
John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch: In Australia,Steve, you talked about Julimar and the associated discovery being commercial.How are you going to produce that, or where?
Steve Farris: John, in terms of the development plans, we have about threedifferent scenarios that we're working on because we have obviously a lot ofpipe to lay. One version is to take it close to Varanus Island without taking it on Varanus Island so that we can move gas. Wehave a 450 million a day pipeline that goes to shore right now at Varanus Island. Reindeer will have apipeline to it because we're going directly to shore at Reindeer to the north.  So the design plans would have either going over, throughReindeer, or coming down and making sure that we can get Julimar gas, Brunellogas, Maitland gas, whatever else gas we find not coming through Varanus, butcoming close to Varanus so we can continue to be able to take gas in from thatpipeline also. Actually, we haven't settled on a design currently, John.
John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch: In Egypt,you spent a fair amount of time talking about your gas discoveries and the AEBand the condensate to the south. Do you think they're connected? How big do youthink the condensate field is?
Steve Farris: The reason I bring up the two independently is -- and I'm sure you caught the gist of it –they are 17 milesapart and one is on a ridge that goes up on the eastern side of the MatruhRidge. We currently have two more exploration wells drilling in the MatruhConcession. One is called Amber which is along the Jade Ridge to the north, andthe other one is a big Jurassic structure which is more than a step out butit's east of Obiat Field. That's a Jurassic test. We have six exploration wellsthat we're going to drill either between now and the end of the first quarterof next year up there.  The potential of the Ridge on the Jade side, I think wetalked about that in order to be one of our significant discovery or potentialprospects it has to have the potential of 50 million barrels of oil or 500 bcfof gas.
John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch: Gulf of Mexico, you mentioned thatrig rates are coming down. It's a good free cash flow generator for you, eventhough it's not always a growth province. Would you consider more consolidationsthere since some of the small fries have had operational issues?
Steve Farris: I would point out that we've never indicated that we aregoing to organically grow the Gulf of Mexico. Ourposition has always been that it is doing and has done a tremendous job for anumber of years and in generating a lot of cash. It has a good size to it rightnow. I can't see us getting significantly larger.  From a smaller standpoint, there are still a lot of playersin the Gulf of Mexico. If the right opportunity came by,that would be something we would be interested in. But we are a portfolioplayer so in terms of its size, it fits very nicely in with longer life gas in Canadaand the U.S.and Central Region.
Operator: Your next question comes from Leo Mariani - RBC.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets: I just wanted to clarify the growth in your Egyptian gasvolume. Correct me if I'm wrong, but do you feel that you expect some plantcapacity expansions in the first quarter of '08 as well as in the fourthquarter of '08? If that's the case, could you give us a sense of the magnitudeof those?
Steve Farris:  Well, if I said thefirst quarter, I misspoke. I meant to say the third quarter. We have two trainsthat are coming on, one will be right behind the other. Actually, it should beon a little bit before the end of the third quarter, and they're both 100million day trains. Both of those will come on first or the fourth quarter. Sowe have 200 million a day gross, which has the capacity of about 16,000 barrelsof liquids or a little less, of which we have between 45% and 50% depending onwhat the prices do, because price has something to do with the cost recoveryoil that we get.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets: A question on Argentina.One of the things you referred to in your prepared comments was the fact thatyour price realizations weren't as strong third quarter but you would pick upin the fourth quarter. I was just trying to get a better handle of thedynamics. I noticed your volumes were down around 9% sequentially on the GAAPside. I'm just trying to understand that a little better. I guess you guys weretalking about a cold winter down there in Argentinaand I was a little surprised to see your volumes down if that's the case.
Steve Farris: Well, the volumes are down specifically because the take isout of Tierra del Fuego. That's not a performance issue.That has to do with a Methanex contract that's going to Chilethat Argentinadoes not want us to export gas to Chileright now. So, the volume, we can produce what we produced every quarter beforethat, and hopefully, we'll continue to raise that.  Our production from when we got in there, we're up about 19%on the gas side, and we can find gas. We can find hydrocarbons down there. Thisis going to be an issue of economics and what they allow us to do in thefuture.
Roger Plank: It's a little bit upside down like a number of things downthere. They say you can't export because we need the gas in this country but inTierra Del Fuego, basically that time of the year thepipelines to the north where the population is are full. So the net result iswe've got to shut in the production rather than selling it to Methanex. Sothat's about 16 million to 20 million a day that was curtailed.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets: Can you give us a sense of how oil drilling is going downthere in Argentina,what your plans are for the near future?
Steve Farris:  We have basically twodifferent areas as you might know. We have Tierra Del Fuegowhich is down at the south and then we have our Neuquen drilling and most ofthe Neuquen stuff that we're doing is extensional type work around fields thatwe acquired from Pioneer.  In the Tierra Del Fuego area, we are shooting a 2,000 squarekilometer 3D seismic shoot there that should be done by the second quarter ofnext year, across not only the existing fields but also as part of a shootacross 680,000 acresdown there. This is a very, very under-drilled province in terms of explorationpotential.  San Sebastianfield is a 65 million barrel oil field, so there is a lot of potential downthere to find additional oil. One is an exploration play and the other one isan exploitation play.
Floyd Price:  A couple ofspecifics, we drilled an oil well. 
Steve Farris:  I'm sorry -- forthose of you who don't know, this is Floyd Price who runs our international Argentinaand Australia.
Floyd Price: Just to give you a feel about Tierra Del Fuego,like Steve was talking about, we just fracced a well down there that came onfor 165 barrels of oil a day. We drilled another exploration well that came inon Don Piadra and it came on for 5 million a day but it was about 50 barrels amillion when you took into account the gasoline as well as the condensate wewere making with it. So very rich, and we think we can do pretty well with ourliquids.
Steve Farris:
 : Sometimes the gas gets clogged up down there because oflimited pipeline capacity. They are expanding and looping that line to thenorth, aren't they, Floyd?
Floyd Price:  That will happentowards the end of 2008.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets:  Moving over to AustraliaI know it's a little early in the game and you had three very nice discoveriesthis year, you talked about potential around 1.3 Tcf and you're still workingon development plans. Do you have any estimate of the kind of potentialdevelopment cost there on a per Tcf basis or anything like that?
Steve Farris: I mentioned to John Herrlin that we have three differentdesign schemes. It really depends on which one of those we pick. When we getcloser to a final design that we are going to go with, it's probably moreappropriate to talk about where we think the cost will be. I'd be estimating right now, and it could besignificantly off one way or the other.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Hiberon - Wachovia.
David Hiberon –Wachovia: You mentioned in Alberta worst case scenario, if the taxpackage goes through or the interest goes through as planned, if you look at aCapEx budget call it $700 million to $800 million, you reduce that, where doesthat CapEx go?
Steve Farris:  In Canada?
David Hiberon –Wachovia: Yes, if you were to take it out of Alberta,where would you deploy it elsewhere in the program in your portfolio?
Steve Farris: Well, our winter drilling program in our shale gas in B.C.is about $100 million this year. We have the opportunity to spend it. What I'dhope and as many of you might know this evening they're supposed to detail theoutline of their new royalty scheme. I don't know who listened to the Premieryesterday, but it was a little more steady than at least what the rhetoric hasbeen around it.  There's some hope that they will phase in any royaltyadjustments they may have, which would go a long way in trying to look atcapital budgets in Alberta nextyear. There's some talk that their deep drilling royalties may not be part of adeep gas drilling. It would probably cut at least a couple hundred milliondollars out of our budget in Albertanext year, but that's a supposition, honestly.
David Hiberon –Wachovia: I know that's a supposition, though it sounds like you wouldallocate a little more to B.C., and then just elsewhere throughout the program.
Steve Farris: Unless it just gets really chaotic up there in Alberta,I can't imagine us spending -- our budget will probably be somewhere aroundwhat it is this year and honestly it could be higher.
David Hiberon –Wachovia: One more big picture question. There's been a lot ofspeculation and I think the general consensus was Canadawould come off a little quicker, not for you but for industry as a whole oncethe rig count plummeted last year. I think maybe some people were surprisedabout the level of exports into the U.S.,that it didn't fall off more. Do you have any feel for why that was? Was it afunction of CBM production or was it a function of the marginal wells gotknocked off first?
Steve Farris: I don't know. The only thing I would say is if they use theproposal that they're talking about or the one that the panel came up with, andit may take six months to fall off but you are going to see a real reduction inAlberta drilling. That can't doanything but reduce the amount of gas that's going to come this way. Two orthree months are really hard to forecast.
David Hiberon –Wachovia:  Yes.
Steve Farris:  A year is much longerbut that's even pretty short. Some of these things have a long term effect.
David Hiberon –Wachovia: We'll wait and see what happens tonight. Thanks.
Operator:  Your next question comes from James Pascelli – TMV.
James Pascelli – TMV: This is a follow-up on the last question. I know the trendsdon't look good for Canada but with Alberta gas recently around 5.95 or so, notterribly low, it's been lower, are you thinking that the industry is lookingfor something closer to $7 an Mcf to really get things going again or do youjust think that the latest announcement about the royalties et cetera is goingto put a big damper on any more interest in Canada? I'd like to add to that,that when everybody is getting discouraged with Canada,perhaps it's time to take a second look or we're getting close to a time totaking a second look.
Steve Farris:  I think the biggestconcern, frankly, is the uncertainty around what is going on. I heard thePremier last night say that they want to put some certainty in this and if theydon't, it will put a damper on it because in the world today, people have a lotof different places to put capital and I think that the most important thingthey could do would be to come up with something and stick to it.  I think it has more to do with the places a lot of peopleare drilling than it does necessarily on price. Certainly costs have been highin Canada. Theyare coming down as they're coming down in the U.S.We're not totally oblivious to the large service companies earnings and wherethey're getting their earnings, but I think there is an awful lot more capacityout there.  I happen to have agentleman from one of the very large service companies in this morning, and ifrig rates just stay the same there's probably 20% more capacity than there wasa year ago and there's going to be 20% more the following year. So I thinkthat's going to have an impact on the competition and what the cost side is goingto do.
James Pascelli – TMV: Well, I think the negativity is extreme. The question is howmuch worse does it get? Obviously I've heard a lot of the calls on the servicecompanies. The tax proposal is somewhat self-defeating. I'm just wonderingwhere the turning point is.
Steve Farris:  We'll find out. It's going to be interesting, let me put itthat way. We're supposing about something we know nothing about yet because wehaven't seen the final proposal.
Operator: Your next question comes from Adam O'Laughlin - BMO CapitalMarkets.
Adam O’Laughlin - BMOCapital Markets: Can you revisit quickly again what you're expecting inproduction in the North Sea again for the next quarter?
Steve Farris: We're looking at about 60,000 barrels a day.
Adam O’Laughlin - BMOCapital Markets: Next year, where is the growth in production really going tocome from? I assume it's really in Australiaand the oil. Can you elaborate a little bit? I know it's exploration success,but just a little bit of segmentedgrowth?
Steve Farris:  Well, I thinkcertainly you're going to see some growth in the United States, you're going to see growth in theCentral Region. I think given where we are in the North Sea,I think you could see some growth in the North Sea.We've had a bunch of ups and downs in the North Sea thisyear. Certainly, we're going to see some growth in Egyptas we have in the past and with two trains coming on that are going to come onat the end of the third quarter, you're going to see some significant growth inthe fourth quarter of next year coming out of Egypt.But we have an active drilling program there.  Unless we get some surprises out of Argentina,you're going to see some growth in Argentina.I think the only area that we don't advertise growth in is the Gulf of Mexico, because that is a different part of our engine than therest of our regions, and it is wide open with respect to Canada.I mean, that's a function of how much capital and what kind of returns you canget in Canada,because many of you probably have heard me say, there's more gas in the WesternSedimentary Basin of Canada than any other place in North America.So it's just a question of economics.
Operator: Thank you. It appears we have no further questions. At thistime, I'd like to turn the conference back over to our presenters for anyadditional or closing remarks.
Bob Dye: Thanks for joining us. If any of you have further questionsI'll be in my office. Thanks again.

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Apache Corporation second quarter earnings 2007 conference call. This call is being recorded. Today's presentation will be hosted by Mr. Bob Dye, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Dye, please go ahead. 
Bob Dye: Thanks for joining us today. This morning Apache Corporation released second quarter 2007 results, which totaled earnings per share of $1.89 and cash flow of $1.47 billion, which is a non-GAAP number.  Today’s discussion may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions and no assurance can be given that these expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located on our web site. In addition, any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss will be identified as such with a reconciliation also located on our web site at www.apachecorp.com.  Steve Farris, our CEO, and Roger Plank, our CFO, will now make prepared remarks prior to taking questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. 
Steve Farris: Thank you, Bob and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Apache second quarter results were outstanding. Second quarter production set an all time record yield by production growth in nearly every region. Our worldwide equivalent production was up 14% year over year and 7% relative to the first quarter of 2007. Our cash flow set an all-time quarterly record up 16%, relative to the same time last year, and 23% relative to the first quarter.  Absent our non-cash impact of exchange fluctuations on our deferred tax liability and other revenues that were in the second quarter, earnings would have been $3.01 per share which would rank at one of the best quarters Apache has had also.  Before going into our activity I'd like to thank many of you for attending our investment conference in Houston last month. The majority of my comments today will be on updating our view on Apache's portfolio and the continued progress we are making in key areas across the company.  With strong first half of 2007 production, we are well on our way to achieving growth at the top end of our 9% to 12% production growth guidance that we gave earlier in the conference. We are also comfortable with our projection for 2008 of 6% to 10% and have 108,000 barrels of oil per day of production coming on line for 2009 and 2010 from six development projects in the pipeline.  Our resource base can support double-digit growth through the remainder of the decade. Our specific year-over-year growth rates will be dictated by our commitments to deliver sector-leading shareholder returns.  I'd like now to just give you an update of our overall portfolio. In the central region of the US, I'd like to really focus on two main resource positions. First we have a very material and attractive position in tight gas in Anadarko Basin which makes us the third largest gas producer in Oklahoma. We benefit from a low risk multiple drilling inventory and a low risk capture gas resource potential of 2.3 TCF. We have 20 rigs running in the Basin this quarter and production was up 20% in the second quarter of 2006.  Next I'd like to turn to the Permian Basin, which is one of the most material long life light oil plays in the United States, and Apache is one of the leading players there. We produced 52,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day and we have about 1.3 billion barrels of captured resource potential. During the second quarter we completed the acquisition of the Anadarko Permian position which provides us incremental organic growth opportunities of nearly 200,000 acres that came with the acquisitions. At the end of the quarter we had five rigs running in the Basin and production was up 25% from the second quarter of 2006.  In our Gulf Coast area which is a very steady generator of excess cash, we had record production also. Second quarter of 2007 is the highest point our production has been in our history and it surpasses what we were producing there prior to the Hurricanes Rita and Katrina. It also keeps us on track to realize nearly a $1 billion in excess cash for the year and underlying the steady contribution of this region, this is the fourth out of five years which we have achieved excess cash of between $800 million and $1 billion. The region had an outstanding quarter, all time record production was 35% up from a year ago and 9% from the first quarter of 2007.  I would like to now turn to our international areas. I will first speak to Argentina and then go to the North Sea. Argentina is already proving to an excellent contributor to our portfolio. Over the last two years it has generated after tax returns of 19% and that is with an average gas realization hovering around a dollar. It has also generated organic production growth in the 10% to 20% range per annum. We have great running room and have over 1 billion barrel equivalent capture opportunity.  During the second quarter of 2007, we saw further progress in the region as the Secretary of Energy enacted a large gas sales redistribution agreement that will effectively increase Apache’s realized price in the country by one-third. That agreement is expected to be implemented in the third quarter. With superior growth opportunities and attractive returns, we believe Argentina has outstanding potential.  Turning to the Forties Field in the North Sea, the Forties Field is a multi-billion barrel resource and we are applying our material asset expertise with great results. We have nearly completed the top side refurbishment program that will extend the life of the field, and increase the recoverable reserves. We have now recovered all our invested capital and have an increased our remaining reserves by 35%. We have 450 million barrels of net resource potential in the field, and every one percentage point of additional recovery over the coming years gives us 50 million barrels of light oil.  I should mention that the third quarter of 2007, our production will be impacted by our Alpha platform turnaround which will also be a time when we’ll be installing our back up total field compression. Echo and Alpha are linked, so we’ll be down about 20,000 barrels a day for 18 days and if you amortize that over the quarter, that’s about 3,900 barrels a day. The North Sea is a very attractive and material opportunity for us, as majors continued to shift their focus to other regions. We are well positioned as being a leading player to realize the value of the 6 billion barrels of commercial oil estimated to remain in the basin.  I would like to now to spend the remainder of the time discussing what we call our edge regions, our three core international growth areas of Australia, Canada and Egypt. First in Australia -- and Australia is an outstanding resource growth potential for Apache. We now have four development projects in Australia alone that will deliver nearly 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day for Apache in 2011.  Apache currently represents about 8.5% of our worldwide production. But with just these projects that we have in hand, it we will bring our production equal to 12%of our current worldwide volumes over the next few years. We have 12 million acres of leasehold, we have access to 2.1 billion barrels of resource potential.  At the investment conference we highlighted our ongoing development projects, two exploration areas that we are focusing on over the next couple of years and the significant improving natural gas prices. At Van Gogh and Pyrenees developments, both of them are on schedule to add 20,000 barrels a day and both are proceeding on schedule.  Last month we announced the results of our first quarter Donald development well at Van Gogh, the Theo 3-H well, and it tested at a rate of 9,694 barrels a day from the top of the main Barrow field play. We intend to drill 17 lateral holes in our development plan.  The FPSO is under construction, first production is scheduled to come online in 2009 at a growth rate of 63,000 barrels a day and Apache is the operator and owns 52.5%.  On July 3rd, BHP and Apache both sanctioned the Pyrenees development plan that includes 13 subsidy development wells which will be tied back to an FPSO also. First production is expected in late 2009 at a rate of about 90,000 barrels a day. BHP is our operator here and we have 28.57% working interest in the projects.  In the first quarter of this year we announced the Julimar discovery that encountered 132 feet of net pay in three different sands. Two of those were tested at the combined rate of 85 million cubic feet of gas a day. Last week we announced a successful Julimar well that encountered 224 feet of net pay in six different zones which strongly solidifies our belief that we have a discovery in excess of a TCF of gas. Apache operates that with 65%. Currently underway, we are studying the development of Julimar and Reindeer, a discovery we made a couple of years ago, to bring on those platforms with first production expected to be in 2010. Combined, these developments should add about 28,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the latter part of 2010.  Two expiration areas that we are pursuing in Australia, one is primary oil and the other is primary gas. In the Carnarvon Basin, we have several large gas prospects that are targeting cretaceous, Jurassic and Triassic reservoirs. With the John Brooks field and the Julimar discoveries as go bys, we are currently drill the Rosella prospect southwest of our 1 TCF Brooks field which is currently making 250 million a day from three wells; and later this year we will drill the Brunello prospect north of Julimar. Each of these prospects has the potential to find a TCF of gas.  I might point out that actually drilling Rosella we have had a peak at the pay sand, and we have run a resistivity log and a gamma log. We have yet to run the porosity log; but so far we at least have the sands we were looking for.  The gas markets in Australia turned sharply higher 18 to 24 months ago, really due to increasing demand from the mining industry, as well as a lack of uncontracted supplies from Apache and other producers in the basin. This situation is expected to last for a number of years and really should continue to sustain higher gas prices. Short-term contracts have gone for as high as $6.50 per MCF, over three times the $1.75 average price that we've received over the past ten years.  We're also pursuing an exciting oil exploration program in the Gippsland Basin. And the Gippsland Basin has 23 known fields that have produced 4 billion barrels of oil and 5.5 TCF. We've been able to obtain a significant acreage position, directly adjacent to two 1 billion barrel fields that have never had 3-D seismic shot on it. We have contracted the Ocean Patriot rig for 18 months and have identified a number of prospects in the 50 to 100 million barrel range and we should have that rig available to us in the second quarter of 2008. Clearly, Australia will be one of Apache's key growth areas over the next several years.  Turning to Canada, our Canadian portfolio gives us a very large resource potential in shale gas, coal bed methane and high impact deep gas exploration. Our Canadian shale gas resource potential alone is 6 TCF, and you'll be hearing more and more about our shale gas position in the coming quarters.  After having worked the last three years on earning acreage on a massive farm-out from ExxonMobil, this year we are engineering our portfolio to a more balanced program of exploration and exploitation. As many of you are aware, we reduced our capital spending at the beginning of the year, but really have been able to keep our production steady which tells you something about the quality and depth of our portfolio.  We have started to see meaningful reductions in cost in our shallow drilling areas during the course of the year, and we expect to increase our activity level during the second half of 2007.  Finally, in Canada we've now drilled a 22-well pilot program in a coal bed methane play, if successful Apache has over 500 sections with resource potential in excess of a TCF of gas.  Turning to Egypt, to give you a sense of the materiality of our position there, we're the second-largest independent E&P company across the Middle East. Based on reserve multiples of recent transactions, Apache Egypt would be worth in excess of $10 billion. Our current net production is 60,000 barrels a day and 235 million cubic feet of natural gas and we control over 19 million acres in the western desert of Egypt. At the end of the quarter, we were running 36 rigs which was up from 28 rigs this time last year.  Because of our scale and our credibility, we've been able to work with our Egyptian partners in some creative ways. One of the ways is with our 2X project, an agreement we signed in the summer of 2005, to work together with EGPC to double Apache's production on our existing concessions by 2010. With 17% of our worldwide production volumes, doubling production in over five years at an equivalent compounded growth rate of 15% per year, will drive meaningful growth across the entire organization.  This is visible growth from existing resources, which includes the production growth from water floods and further development of our Kauster field which totals about 40,000 barrels of oil per day. Our total Egyptian resource potential is 1.6 billion barrels.  We're currently pursuing three exploration plays in the western desert, that combined have about 200 million barrels of oil equivalent discovery potential. They include the Matruh Jurassic A&B plays north of Khalda, South Teric Jurassic play which is east of our big Khalda concession, and the Bahariya oil play in the northeast. We also have about 200 million barrels of low-risk potential in several water floods that we're developing. Current major project activities are focused in the Asala ridge in East Bahariya, and the Carmon and Khalda in [inaudible].  So it's easy to understand why we're enthusiastic about Egypt and when you couple the growth rate with the fact that Egypt generally yields the second highest returns in the company behind the Gulf of Mexico, we can continue to grow in Egypt for a number of years.  Before making a few closing comments, I'd like to turn it over to Roger Plank, Apache's CFO for a financial overview of the quarter. 
Roger Plank: Thanks, Steve and good afternoon, everyone. We did indeed have an outstanding quarter. To underscore Apache's progress so far this year, my comments will contrast the financial performance between the first and the second quarters of the year. In addition to record production, Apache delivered an excellent quarter with record financial results in several categories.  Revenues of $2.5 billion were a record, as higher production coupled with continued strength in prices to beat our previous record by 9%. Cash flow of $1.5 billion exceeded our former record by 9% and earnings at $632 million or $1.89 per share were among our best ever. As we'll cover in a minute, despite the industry's continued cost pressures, our margins remained stout.  Apache's financial story for the quarter revolves around oil. With demand strong and access to oil opportunities increasingly off limits, prices have strengthened to more than 10 times the price of North American natural gas. Apache's shareholders have benefited from our ample oil production, which significantly impacted our quarter.  Oil production was up 9.5% during the quarter to 253,000 barrels per day. It represented 44% of our production, but it generated 60% of our revenue. The quarter also benefited from premium prices for our international oil production, while North American oil realizations rose around $5 a barrel to $60.72, international realizations jumped $10 a barrel to $66.75 on strong Brent and Tapas realizations. In fact, our second quarter Australian realizations which are tied to Tapas were just shy of $75 a barrel, the highest quarterly price we've ever received for oil anywhere.  While we don't have a crystal ball on prices, we do believe Apache's balanced product mix give us a significant competitive advantage. At times such as this the 6:1BTU equivalent just doesn't adequately portray the market value of our oil. If you like oil, you ought to like Apache, particularly given that we have an estimated 60,000 barrels a day slated to come online from just three international fields over the next several years.  Before breaking out our operating margins and costs, I want to comment briefly on two items in our GAAP accounting results that should be removed to see Apache's true financial performance this quarter.  On the one hand, exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a non-cash deferred tax charge to our GAAP reported earnings. With the with U.S. dollar lower relative to the Canadian the theory is it will take more U.S. dollars to eventually pay our Canadian tax liability. So that difference was mark-to-market through our income statement.  On the other hand, we also had a $24 million gain or $0.04 a share in other revenue related to timing differences in our Australian oil inventories, and this will balance out through the year. In fact, year-to-date other revenue nets to just a negative $2 million. Removing these changes in other revenue on the non-cash deferred taxes, gives you an adjusted earnings of $2.01 per share.  This business is all about returns and Apache returns are quite competitive. Based on our performance so far year-to-date, annualized return on equity should average in the high teens and return on capital employed should average in the mid teens.  Returns are, of course, driven by margins and we continue to focus on our margins. For the quarter, overall cash costs were up 5% to $13.72 per barrel of oil equivalent, primarily driven by higher production taxes associated with higher prices. However, realizations were up 12% equivalent, fully absorbing this cost increase and propelling our margins up 15% from last quarter to over $33 a barrel of oil equivalent. Even including a 4% increase in DD&A, our total pre-tax margin increased to over $21 per barrel equivalent from $17.40 sequentially.  Focusing in on costs. On the lifting cost side, our second quarter LOE rate decreased $0.09 to $8.04 per barrel equivalent, a step in the right direction. This rate included $0.36 per BOE of lingering hurricane repairs which should wrap up during the third quarter, and $0.15 per BOE for the impact of stock-based compensation expense. Absent these swings, our second quarter running rate was $7.53 of BOE which is consistent with the first quarter and the base rate that we'd hoped to continue.  G&A expense decreased $0.05 per BOE from first quarter to $1.36 per barrel equivalent, also a step in the right direction. This includes a $0.13 charge for an overdue change to our directors' retirement plan and absent this one-time adjustment, G&A would have been comparable to our anticipated ongoing run rate of approximately $1.25 per barrel.  Full cost DD&A of $10.22 per BOE was up $0.43 with a full quarter's impact from the Permian acquisition, which was added at above our historic rate, and drilling costs which are also above historic levels. Severance and other tax of $2.52 per BOE rose $0.50 sequentially on higher revenues, primarily in the U.S. and North Sea.  Finance expense increased $0.35 to $1.22 per BOE, increased debt for our Permian purchase, even so our debt-to-cap rate dropped to 26% from 27% on gains in our equity base from continued strong earnings.  I commented on the impact that foreign exchange had on deferred taxes. Given the magnitude of the change in the exchange rate year-to-date and the lingering effect over the balance of the year, our second half rate should match the 42% that we averaged in the first half. Fortunately, the clock starts over every January 1st, so absent any FX changes, next year's rate should fall back below 40%. 41% of our taxes were deferred in the second quarter, consistent with a 40% to 45% target range.  With gas at $6 an MCF in the near month I wanted to take a moment to briefly comment on hedging. Historically, we have used the cost of collars to underpin our economics for acquisitions and more recently, for our 2006 and 2007 drilling programs as well. Of nearly 400 million cubic feet per day hedged at Apache, just under 300 million cubic feet per day have floors ranging from $6.06 to $8.41, with an average floor of $7.13. These should mitigate the risk of further possible gas price erosion in the near term.  We've also expanded this approach of hedging major investments, given that we now have committed in excess of $2 billion to develop the numerous discoveries that Steve discussed earlier. With capital committed today, and first production two years out, we thought it only prudent to enter into costless collars with $65 floors and ceilings as high as $80 a barrel to hedge from anywhere from 4,000 barrels a day to 7,000 barrels per day between July of 2009 and June of 2012. With two years before these projects come online, we have the luxury of time to determine whether or when we might add to these hedge positions.  In summary, Apache turned in a fine second quarter and first half fueled by record production and the outlook for the second half is excellent. 
 Steve Farris: Thank you, Roger. I might make just a few closing comments before we turn it over to questions. Apache continues to deliver top tier performance and is doing so with increasing momentum, driven by the strength and balance of our portfolio. We're among the E&P leaders in each of our core areas, tight gas and light oil in the U.S., deep gas exploration and conventional shale plays and coal bed methane in Canada, Middle Eastern oil in Egypt, with material exploration and water flood growth potential; large development projects and TCF sized natural gas exploration in Australia.  This is fundamentally a volatile industry as witnessed by the recent pullback in U.S. gas prices. Unlike many of our peers, Apache does not rely on any single resource play type or commodity price, which puts our shareholders in an advantaged position. With 8.9 billion barrels of identified resource potential across 46 million acres worldwide, we have significant exploration potential in our core areas of Australia, Canada and Egypt. We have six development projects scheduled to come online over the next three years which will add 108,000 barrels a day by 2011. Apache therefore is well-positioned to continue to deliver outstanding growth and profitability into the next decade.  We're obviously excited about the opportunities in front of us and with that, we'd like to turn it over to your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Tom Convington – AG Edwards. 
 Tom Convington – AG Edwards: Good afternoon. A question here on the shale play up in Canada, Steve. Could you give us a little more color on the acreage that is being built up there, the timeframe for evaluating that? Whether you have drilled any vertical wells, what kind of rates you are seeing? Along those lines. 
Steve Farris: It is a very competitive play. We have drilled some wells, we have also drilled a couple horizontal wells. As I said during my comments, you will see more and more of this over the coming quarters. Right now, there are competitive reasons why I would rather not answer that question. 
 Tom Convington – AG Edwards: Are there characteristics of the shale play that are particularly attractive relative to some of the U.S. ones, or can you give us a sense of the – 
Steve Farris: I am sorry, I didn’t understand the question. 
 Tom Convington – AG Edwards: Are there characteristics of the shale play that are particularly attractive relative to some of the U.S. plays that people have been exploiting over the last few years? 
Steve Farris: Yes, obviously we compared it to a number of plays, the shale plays that are happening in the United States and elsewhere. The amount of gas per section compare very favorably to other plays in the United States. 
 Tom Convington – AG Edwards: Also in Canada, can you give us an update on your deep gas drilling in some of the other areas? 
Steve Farris: We are obviously drilling deep gas wells in Canada, and we have a deep gas well that we are currently drilling right now, but we have no results on it yet. Certainly that will be coming out in the next month or so. 
 Tom Convington – AG Edwards: Finally in Egypt, in the Western Desert, you’ve recently picked up 9 million or 10 million acres west of your current concessions. Could you characterize the acreage and what your commitment is to drill up there? 
Steve Farris: We picked up about 10 million acres there. We have to drill three wells; we have to drill a well on each concession. We are shooting a 3-D seismic. We have a commitment to shoot some 3-D seismic which we will shoot significantly more than the commitment we have under the concessions. In fact, that seismic is being shot as we speak. Hopefully we will have potential wells being drilled this year on it.  In terms of the productivity of it, it is very lightly drilled. There are actually 11 wells across that entire acreage position, so it is certainly big. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs. 
 Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs: Thank you, good afternoon. On capital spending, how impactful is the acceleration of activity in Canada in the near term? Separately longer term, how do you think about the spending needed to bring on the core projects you referenced in Australia? 
Roger Plank: Can you repeat the question? 
 Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs: Sure. With regards to capital spending, how impactful is the near-term acceleration of activity in Canada? Separately longer-term, what do you see as the impact of capital spending needed to bring on the core projects in Australia? 
Steve Farris: In terms of our Canadian activities, we are going back and starting to drill some of our normal shallow gas stuff. It wouldn’t be significant this year. Certainly, the shale play in Canada over the coming 18 months could be significant.  In Australia, we have the Van Gogh development is net to Apache of about $300 million and the Pyrenees development is about $500 million. Current scoping on Julimar and Reindeer are significantly more than that, in the $700 million range. If we are fortunate enough to find something down at Rosella, that will probably come through the island so it won’t be nearly as significant. 
 Brian Singer – Goldman Sachs: That’s helpful. Separately, the production was quite strong in the Gulf region. Can you talk to that and the sustainability of that over the next few quarters? 
Steve Farris: Our Gulf regions had an excellent first and second quarter with the drill bit, frankly. We continue to drill wells, we have about 11 rigs running in the Gulf of Mexico. It is amazing what they can do when they can get back to work and quite having to clean up from the hurricanes.  We are expecting at least steady to upward growth for the second half of this year in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Bob Morris – Banc of America. 
 Bob Morris – Banc of America: Going back to Canada, you said the acceleration wasn’t significant, but I know you have had an $800 million budget there this year, which is a 35% drop versus last year. Can you give some magnitude as to how much that bumps up for the full year? In other words, instead of spending $800 million in Canada now is it going to be $900 million, or what will that go to? 
Steve Farris: Bob, I wouldn’t expect it to be a lot more than that. Most of that will be summer drilling or fall drilling before the winter drilling program comes on. 
 Bob Morris – Banc of America: So $900 million is what you are saying? 
Steve Farris: It wouldn’t be much more than that. Maybe 120. 
 Bob Morris – Banc of America: You just mentioned the Manville coal, that you completed a 22 well pilot there. Can you tell us a little bit more about the results or when you expect results? Your impression on the potential there at this stage? 
Steve Farris: We have three monitor wells and we have got 16 take wells. We are starting to dewater it. We are actually seeing a little bit of gas, which is a little early. So far, so good. We will just have to see how it waters down. But we are excited about it. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Jules Yang – Citi. 
 Jules Yang – Citi: Steve, you mentioned you have 12 million acres in Australia. Can you talk about any well commitments and exploration thresholds on that acreage? 
Steve Farris: Most of the Carnarvon basin, in fact we are drilling our only commitment well on acreage to save acreage right now. It is called the Baggs, it is north of the Pyrenees Van Gogh stuff. For the most part, that acreage is held by production or held under a concession that has production on it.  In the Gibson basin, the majority of that is acreage that we have about five-year terms on, seven-year terms on, and we have a seven well commitment across that acreage position. 
 Jules Yang – Citi: In the North Sea, you commented the majors are focusing away from that area. What are you seeing in terms of their interest in divesting assets in that area? 
Steve Farris: I am sure you have seen Shell’s announcement on selling some properties in the North Sea. Frankly, that is not something we would be interested in. I think the North Sea, like a number of other places in the world, for majors at some point in time they are going to start moving toward less mature areas. I think we probably would have seen that when we bought Forties back in 2003 had prices not gone up so quickly. We have nothing on the horizon today, but I expect that to take place over the next three or four years. 
 Jules Yang – Citi: Just a long-term trend in that direction? The last question I have is, you mentioned good growth in the Gulf of Mexico. Last year you spent a lot of time and effort replacing production with relatively little reserve bookings. Is that situation with the growth in production today changing? Are you moving away from drilling PUDs and actually discovering new reserves, or are you still in the PUD mode? 
Steve Farris: We drill a number of new reserve projects this year. The one thing I would say is that we still have a number of down platform expenses coming out of Grand Isle 40, so you are going to see some of those numbers in our capital budget for 2007. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets. 
 Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: A quick question for you in Argentina. I noticed that your gas price realization for the second quarter was about $1.02 here. I was under the impression that prices were improving, and this was down a little bit from first quarter. Can you give us a little bit of color on what is going on there? 
Steve Farris: It is real simple. What has happened is they are going through an energy crisis, and in fact a member of our board, and chairman and myself and Roger were in Argentina to add a little bit of the timeframe there. We actually had office buildings downtown shut electricity off at 4:00 in the afternoon. So what happens is that you get your gas redirected from your higher priced markets because of the high usage of gas by residential.  We got redirected on quite a bit of our gas to go to a much lower contract. Frankly, we are seeing on commercial contracts, we are currently discussing a contract in the $3.90 range over three years. So you are beginning to see the inevitable when you start controlling prices, is they start going the other way, they are going to go up very quickly. 
Roger Plank: The other thing you have to keep in mind is that it is upside down to what we think of up here, in more ways than one. It is winter down there now. So the peak demand for residential heating is in the second quarter and the first part of the third quarter. So you have more gas that has to go into that lowest, fixed-price market during the winter months. In fact, they are having one of the coldest winters they have ever had, and actually while we were there they had their first snow in 90 years. So part of what you are seeing is that cold weather filtering through and instead of prices going up, which happened in the United States, they go down because you have these fixed priced markets to serve.  But nonetheless, as Steve indicated, the incremental gas that doesn’t get diverted to the fixed priced markets is now going for around 3X the average price that you quoted for the quarter. So over time, as we bring in incremental volumes as we get out of winter, you ought to see that filter into our average price. 
 Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: On some of these volumes that have been diverted to the residential market, is that something that Apache mandated or is this a government mandated thing that has happened to you down there? 
Steve Farris: It is a government mandated thing when they don’t have enough gas, under any commercial contract they take the gas for the residential market. 
Roger Plank: One thing that Steve alluded to, that if you weren’t at our conference, that is benefiting us down there or should benefit us going forward is it is mandated by the government. The proportions are mandated by the government and they have just gone back and recalculated how much each company has to direct towards the fixed priced markets on a go-forward basis.  So that pick up that Steve mentioned of about one-third in our price is as a result of our, under the new formula, having to deliver less into the fixed price markets sometime here in the third quarter on a go-forward basis. So our price ought to go from, if it was $1 it ought to be up closer to $1.50 on a go-forward basis, once that goes into effect. 
 Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: Sticking with Argentina, it looks like you had a fair bit of a production bump on the gas side from first quarter to second quarter. Are you guys out there pretty aggressively drilling for gas? 
Steve Farris: Yes. We are drilling for gas and in Tierra del Fuego we now have two of our rigs running there and we are drilling primarily for oil down there. Certainly we have been pleasantly surprised by some of the deep gas wells that we have been able to drill. In fact, when we were down there again we were testing, what is considered deep down there is certainly not considered deep in the Anadarko basin.  But it came on for 13 million a day and 650 barrels of condensate a day, so as Raymond likes to say, the rocks are good; the rocks are friendly. We think we can continue that, frankly. 
Roger Plank: Not to beat a dead horse, but it took me forever to fathom all of this and get used to how it works. But under this new arrangement, we have to deliver roughly 160 million cubic feet of gas per day into the fixed price market. So when we bring on another 10 million over and above that, we don’t get $1; we get this free market price, so that is high $2, low $3.  The world has changed for the economics, as Steve indicated. Our rate of return with the low price has been 19%. So the rate of return at triple the price is going to be quite a bit better than what it has been historically. 
 Leo Mariani – RBC Capital Markets: I may have missed some of the early part of the call here, I guess I caught some comments on good growth in the Gulf of Mexico in the second quarter. Can you touch on the activities there in the U.S.? 
Steve Farris: Let’s start with the Anadarko basin. We have a very active drilling program there. We will drill in the central region, over 350 wells. We have 20 rigs running right now, and I would expect our production increases to continue there. We have had a very good drilling program so far this year, and there is no reason to believe it won’t continue.  In the Gulf Coast, we had a very good drilling quarter, many of those things were coming on starting in the second quarter. We continued to drill wells. We continue to be successful. We are having a good year in the U.S., frankly. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Tom Gardner - Simmons & Company . 
 Tom Gardner - Simmons & Company : Over the past few months there have been a number of large M&A transactions. Can you speak to the current M&A environment? 
Steve Farris: Well, if you are talking about the recent large service merger, that is an interesting merger and it is probably one that a lot of people have talked about for – and not necessarily those two specific companies, but certainly in that sector there would be some amalgamation.  In our sector, in terms of the E&P sector, other than a couple that have been out there like at Pogo that everybody expected something to happen to, I don’t see an awful lot of whispers about what is going on out there. Maybe I am not in the loop, which may be so, but I don’t think it is any different in that arena than it has been in the past. 
 Tom Gardner - Simmons & Company : Following up with that, do you see a bifurcation of the market split along conventional resources and resource plays and would you tend to be a buyer of one versus the other? The same question with regard to domestic versus international assets. 
Steve Farris: I think there are really two sets to that. First of all, we have been and continue to be an acquisitive company. The one thing I would say is we spent an awful lot of time to create the critical mass that we have right now. So in terms of our appetite going forward is more of what would make sense for us over the long term, rather than just making an acquisition. Because we now have 46 million acres across the globe, and we definitely have the resource base to continue to grow internally.  In terms of whether it would be U.S. or international, certainly in terms of maturity of areas, the maturity of the United States is by far the most mature basin in the world. Because if you look out away from that, I think you would be much more inclined to make an acquisition of size outside of the United States than we would inside the United States. 
 Tom Gardner - Simmons & Company : With regard to Canada, I know there have been a number of questions but backing up more to the macro level, I would be interested in getting your view on Canadian drilling activity fall off, specifically do you see the activity ramping back up and when do you see gas production accelerating again? 
Steve Farris: Well there were a number of reasons for why Canadian gas drilling started falling off. Obviously the first is that it is expensive to do business in Canada, but today it is expensive to do business anywhere. You have to be very cognizant of the fact that if something doesn’t make sense, you shouldn’t drill it.  But you also had the law change with the royalty trust, so an awful lot of bloom came off the rose in Canada at the same time. I will say, and this is a personal belief, that I think the Western Canadian sedimentary basin has more gas than any place left in North America. If you look at just the drilling density and the amount of gas that you find, certainly still a very good area. I know that a number of large independents have cut back their capital, and we have also. But long term, Canada is still going to be a very strong player for U.S. gas markets. 
Operator: Your next question comes from John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch. 
 John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch : Two North American ones, Steve. Oil field services costs have been coming down, how much further do you think your dollars will go on an activity basis this year in terms of your drilling program versus last year? 
Steve Farris: That depends, regionally. I will tell you especially in the Gulf of Mexico they will go quite a bit further because rig costs are down $50,000 to $60,000 a day. When you move on land, we are seeing probably a 20% drop in the mid-continent. And in Canada and some areas in our shallow gas areas, we have seen honestly, as much as 40% difference in costs we spent last year and the cost for well support this year. 
 John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch : Say we are at $6 or under for the second half. Would you slow down your activity in North America for gas drilling? 
Steve Farris: Well, I think that is a selective question. Again, I think certainly our rates of return in the Gulf of Mexico are such that in that place, it is all about rates. In terms of Canada, I would tell you because of the differentials up there, if you are seeing a NYMEX $6, you are probably seeing under $5 in Canada. You really have to ask yourself whether or not you are going to allocate capital up there or just discretionary capital, or not. So if we get to that place, we will have to make that decision, John. 
Roger Plank: One thing I tried to allude to in my comments is, we will have to look at that and who knows how far – it would depend on what the price was too, but I did mention, we have 300 million a day of hedges that kick into place below $6. So we do have a mitigating factor in terms of the risk of that happening on a go-forward basis. That should help prop up cash flows somewhat. Frankly, we did that in conjunction with our ’07 drilling program. That ought to help us in that regard should prices deteriorate from here. 
Steve Farris: John, in all honesty, I think the economics are really based on two sides of the equation. One is the price, the other is the cost. I think if you see $6 gas for any extended period of time, you are going to see continuing weakening in service costs. You are going to have to, I mean… 
Operator: At this time we have no further questions. I will turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. 
 Bob Dye: Thanks for joining us, and as always, if any of you have any questions I will be in my office after the call. Talk to you soon.
