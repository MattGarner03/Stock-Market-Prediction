===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-01 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Targa Resources Corp. First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tristan Richardson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Fundamentals. Please go ahead.
Tristan Richardson: Thanks, Michelle. Good morning, and welcome to the first quarter 2025 earnings call for Targa Resources Corp. The first quarter earnings release, along with the first quarter supplement presentation that accompany our call are available on our website at targaresources.com in the Investors section. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. Statements made during this call that might include Targa's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Section 21E of Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings. Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer; Jen Kneale, President; and Will Byers, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, members of Targa's senior management will be available for Q&A, including Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Matt.
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Tristan, and good morning, everyone. We have spent the last many years positioning Targa to be successful across changing environments and to be a beneficiary of market volatility and are proud of our execution across the first four months of the year. We reported record quarterly adjusted EBITDA despite our volumes being impacted by several winter weather events and as we look across the balance of 2025, we feel very good about our outlook. We stepped into global market volatility to opportunistically repurchase nearly $215 million worth of common shares so far this year. We have and will continue to manage the evolving global tariff impacts and have done an excellent job of purchasing steel in advance to limit our potential exposure on capital projects underway. Just as Targa has spent the last many years strengthening our positioning, the rest of the energy value chain has done the same, meaning the industry, we believe is largely well-positioned to manage through any environment with much stronger balance sheet and financial flexibility. We have seen the forward crude price curve shift lower, and our customers are not indicating material changes to their drilling programs for 2025 and 2026, which means we continue to expect meaningful volume growth going forward. In lower commodity price environments, producers typically focus on drilling their highest returning wells, which if you take 2020 as an example, meant rigs left the Permian Basin last and ultimately helped drive record volumes for Targa as we grew volumes in the Permian despite significant impacts from COVID. Since 2020, we have built an excellent footprint across the Delaware Basin to complement our Midland Basin footprint and believe that our best-in-class producer customers have the most resilient underlying drilling inventory. Our core value proposition of increasing adjusted EBITDA and increasing common dividend per share and declining share count is unchanged. We believe that our integrated asset footprint, largest position in the Permian and strong financial position, more than 90% fee-based, investment-grade rating, and leverage ratio at the midpoint of our long-term target range, will allow us to continue to generate attractive returns and return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. Before I turn the call over to Jen to discuss operations in more detail, I would like to thank the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution, even while navigating some difficult winter weather in the first quarter, while continuing to provide best-in-class service and reliability to our customers.
Jen Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Let's talk about our operational results in more detail. Starting in the Permian, our natural gas inlet volumes averaged over 6 billion cubic feet per day during the first quarter, an 11% increase from a year ago. Our Permian volumes were down about 1% from last quarter as we were impacted by several winter weather events. As expected, Permian volumes have rebounded meaningfully and are trending approximately 200 million cubic feet per day higher than the first quarter. We are also forecasting a lot of well completions for the balance of this quarter and beyond, which supports our expectation of significantly higher back half volumes. In Permian Midland, our Pembrook II plant is now expected to come online in the third quarter of 2025. Our East Pembrook and East Driver plants remain on track to begin operations in the second quarter and third quarter of 2026. In Permian Delaware, our Bull Moose II and Falcon II plants remain on track to begin operations in the first quarter and second quarter of 2026, supporting both continued underlying organic growth and the new commercial opportunities that we executed in late 2024. We continue to invest in our Permian intra-basin and long-haul residue gas takeaway and FID of the recently announced Traverse pipeline project will continue to provide flow assurance and access to important markets for our customers. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment, Targa's NGL pipeline transportation volumes averaged 844,000 barrels per day and fractionation volumes averaged 980,000 barrels per day during the first quarter, impacted by winter weather events that reduced volumes from our G&P assets. We also had a planned turnaround at Trains I through III at our CBF fractionation complex in Mont Belvieu across much of the first quarter and into April. Similar to what we are seeing in G&P, NGL volumes across both transportation and fractionation have rebounded. Given the anticipated growth in our Permian G&P business and corresponding announced plan additions, our outlook for NGL supply growth remains strong. Our Delaware Express NGL transportation pipeline remains on track for completion in the third quarter of 2026. Our GCF fractionator was reactivated in the first quarter, and our next fractionators in Mont Belvieu, Trains 11 and 12, remain on track for the third quarter of 2026 and the first quarter of 2027. Turning to our LPG export business at Galena Park, our loadings averaged 13.4 million barrels per month during the first quarter. While we had a few days of fog in the first quarter, our docks were effectively full, and we are seeing continued strength in cargo loading. The demand for LPGs globally remains strong, and we are well-positioned with long-term contracts in place. American supply is cost advantaged, and we believe that growth in U.S. supply will continue to be important to serve global demand. Our LPG export debottleneck expansion is expected to be in service in the fourth quarter, and we remain on track with our larger LPG export expansion, which will increase our loading capacity to 19 million barrels per month to be online in the third quarter of 2027. To build on Matt's earlier comments on our navigation of an evolving market of global tariffs, we see a low-single-digit percentage potential impact to budgeted project costs across our announced projects underway, which would fit well within our contingency for our projects. We are also doing a great job of managing our operating costs and procurement of materials that support our day-to-day operations. We are well-positioned operationally and believe that our wellhead-to-water strategy, driven by activity in the Permian Basin will continue to put us in excellent position to execute for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Will to discuss our first quarter results, outlook and capital allocation. Will?
Will Byers: Thanks, Jen. Targa's reported adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $1.179 billion, a 22% increase from a year ago. The increase was attributable primarily to higher Permian volumes, which drove higher volumes and margin across our integrated NGL system and to 100% ownership of our Badlands assets. Our adjusted EBITDA increased 5% sequentially and was driven by the Badlands transaction and higher marketing margin. As Matt mentioned, we continue to estimate full year 2025 adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $4.65 billion to $4.85 billion. In February, we successfully completed a $2 billion offering comprised of 5.55% notes due 2035 and 6.125% notes due 2055. We used the net proceeds from the debt issuance to fund the repurchase of all of the outstanding preferred equity in Targa Badlands LLC and for general corporate purposes, including to repay borrowings under our commercial paper program. At the end of the first quarter, we had $2.7 billion of available liquidity and our pro forma consolidated leverage ratio was approximately 3.6x, well within our long-term leverage ratio target range of 3x to 4x. We continue to expect net growth capital spending for 2025 in a range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion and continue to estimate 2025 net maintenance capital spending of $250 million. Shifting to capital allocation. Our focus is more of the same from Targa. Maintain our strong investment-grade balance sheet, continue to invest in high-returning integrated projects and return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. We continue to deliver on our share repurchase program, we opportunistically repurchased 125 million in common shares at an average price of $191.86 per share during the first quarter and subsequently to quarter end, we repurchased an incremental 89 million at an average price of $167.28 per share. We also declared a 33% increase to our common dividend for the first quarter of 2025 relative to 2024. We are in excellent financial position with a strong and flexible balance sheet and we'll continue to try to identify the different levers that we can use to best position Targa to create value for our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Tristan.
Tristan Richardson: Thanks, Will. For the Q&A session, we ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up and reenter the queue if you have additional questions. Michelle?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Tonet: With oil price volatility, there's a lot of concern in the market with regards to producer activity. And you touched on this during your call, comments, but I was wondering if you could expand a bit more just with regards to how Targa differs from others as far as your customers who you're levered to versus maybe others, your position in the Permian relative to others? Maybe just if you could dive in a little bit more on how you see that could differentiate Targa in the current environment?
Jen Kneale: Sure, Jeremy. This is Jen. I think when we think about 2025, we feel really good about where we are at this point in the year with one quarter under our belt, where volumes are trending right now in April. The expected activity going forward with additional well completions expected and really where we expect to then exit 2025. We're, of course, in the midst of a lot of conversations with our producers as we consistently are and what we're hearing so far is really that we've got producers with multi-year drilling programs in place, and we expect there to be significant resiliency. I think that our differentiating factors are several. We've got the best G&P footprint across the Midland Basin and the Delaware Basin. And that's supported by what we believe to be the best rock across both of those areas, the best producers that are very well capitalized, very strong, excellent balance sheet and really a view that they are going to drill through cycles with that multi-year drilling program approach in place. And so I think we feel really very differentiated, and that's part of what's driven our outperformance. If you go back and you look at 2020, I think that's really where you saw the differentiation of our Midland Basin footprint, where despite the impacts of COVID, we grew volumes. Since then, we've now acquired what we believe to be the best-in-class Delaware footprint. So we've really got the basin, I think, covered and hopefully, we'll continue to provide excellent customer service to our producers that will put us in really good stead going forward.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then as it relates to CapEx, I was wondering if you might be able to elaborate a bit more on the direction of CapEx 2026 relative to 2025. I'm just wondering on the potential interplay with buybacks. And just how that all mixes together, given the share price volatility?
Jen Kneale: This is Jen, Jeremy. I think that from our perspective, a strong and flexible balance sheet is paramount to everything that we do. It allows us to continue to invest in the business, and then it allows us to pull different levers as opportunities present themselves. And you could see from our perspective that first quarter and in particular, April, presented some of those opportunities, given we were blocked out for half of April, shows that we are pretty active there in the first half of the month. I think as we look forward into 2026, we've got a number of growth capital projects underway that we believe will be much needed. Part of our 2026 spending on projects, particularly on the G&P side is for new processing plants that are supporting not only our organic base, but also the contracts that we entered into in the fourth quarter of 2024. And we think that those are going to be well-positioned projects that will be well utilized. Ultimately, what will change the cadence of growth capital spend in 2026 and beyond is activity levels. And I think that we've put out a pretty good blueprint both through our track record in 2020 and 2021 when we rationalized spending quite significantly. And then also with the more illustrative or hypothetical framework that we published last February. And really, it's that activity levels around the need for gathering and compression that could drive spending or higher, depending where activity levels end up. And then, of course, we'll have to think about the cadence of next project adds. But with the projects that we're adding across Gathering and Processing, Delaware Express on the NGL transportation side, our next two fracs and then our LPG export debottlenecking later this year and the next major expansion, we're going to be sitting in a really good spot from an operating leverage position across the footprint as well.
Operator: Thank you. One moment, for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Spiro Dounis: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, team. Matt, I wanted to go back to your comments about being able to benefit from volatility clearly sort of proven that in the past. I think last call, you even noted about $100 million of optimization in the year that you didn't really count on. And so I guess, you'd have to argue this year potentially even more opportunities for that, just given the volatility. So curious if you start to see that manifest itself anywhere and if that's something that probably could offset some of the commodity impact?
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure. No, good -- good question. We are seeing with our growing footprint, really on the gas marketing side and the NGL marketing side. Just as we're moving more and more volumes through our processing plants and into Belvieu into different markets, we're just seeing more opportunities to monetize some of our positions. So last year was a good year for us. I would say this first quarter, it was a good quarter for us and we kind of beat our expectations in terms of our marketing. We benefited more on the gas marketing side, but also saw a strong NGL marketing as well. But it wasn't to the magnitude; I'd say we saw last year necessarily. I think if you kind of look quarter-to-quarter, we were maybe up around $10 million or so, first quarter to what we kind of pointed to last quarter. So it was some of the sequential beat, yes, just as we see more opportunities, but there's also just good underlying business fundamentals as well.
Spiro Dounis: Got it. Good to hear. Second question, maybe just going to commodity. Maybe just remind us where you are relative to your fee floors and how you're thinking about the hedging strategy from here?
Matt Meloy: Yes. I mean when we provided our guidance, I'd say where we sit now, Waha has been very volatile and bouncing around 0, it's a little higher than that now. We are below our fee floors across our G&P footprint. So that's really unchanged from where we were at the beginning of the year. And our hedging strategy has really not changed too much. The length, the remaining length that we do have, we've hedged 90% of it through 2026. So we've really taken a lot of the commodity price delta out of our -- kind of out of our operating results, which is why you see, even with Waha at 0 or close to it, we're setting records in terms of EBITDA. You rewind five years ago, that would have had a much more punitive impact on us even with our hedging program. So we've done a good job from changing our contracts but also hedging the unprotected fee floor volumes as well.
Operator: Thank you. One moment, for our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Michael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So it seems like you're not seeing any change in LPG export activity levels, which is pretty consistent with your -- what your peers are saying. But I'm wondering if you're seeing any change in the destination of where those cargoes are going versus historical patterns? And do you see any scenario where LPG exports kind of don't move off the docks in the U.S.?
Scott Pryor: Hey Michael, this is Scott. I would say, fair to say that we have not seen any material change in our activity level at our docks as we've moved through not only through the first quarter, but through the second quarter. As Matt mentioned in our comments, we had a very nice first quarter, only impacted a little bit by some fog delays. So it was not quite as robust as what we saw in the fourth quarter. But again, materially speaking, we are fully contracted, not only through the second quarter but through the balance of this year and beyond. I would say that we are hearing that some of the destinations are changing relative to folks doing cargo switching on the water, if you will, so the international market, the waterborne market is very nimble when it starts looking at vessels that are on the water. Some of those have been moved from China over to Japan or Korea and then backfilled from Saudi tons or from other areas. So generally speaking, I would say, yes, some of the transits have changed, but the overall demand has not changed into those specific regions predominantly to the Far East. We are hopeful, much like what we saw with ethane that ethane was excluded from the tariffs for imports into China. We know that there are a variety of discussions that are going on that perhaps LPG could be excluded. We don't have that today. But again, it is a very fluid marketplace that is trying to evaluate what it needs to do. The market has the supply in the U.S. It is growing. Demand is growing worldwide. And I think the market is very capable of figuring out how to get product to where it needs to be from a supply-demand perspective and price will adjust predominantly on the commodity base side of things and not so much on the terminal fee side.
Michael Blum: Okay. Great. No, that's very helpful. Then just had maybe a different way to ask a question on buybacks. Just as we go into what seems like a more volatile macro backdrop, just wanted to get your take on how you're thinking about buybacks? Would you be more cautious trying to protect the balance sheet? Or at this point, should we think of buybacks as sort of part of the ratable program of capital return? Thanks.
Matt Meloy: Yes. Yes. Good question. Hey, Michael. I think as we think about buybacks, we've intentionally positioned that as an opportunistic buyback program. As Will pointed out, our balance sheet is 3.6x debt to EBITDA. We're in really good shape, see good EBITDA growth. So we're in a good financial position to where we see dislocations or weakness to be able to opportunistically repurchase. And that's what you saw us do in April. We moved in, in early April when there was a dislocation and we purchased more. I don't know what that's going to look like as we go forward, but it's really our same posture. I see us continuing to be active buying back our shares and just we'll see what happens in the market, see what volatility is there. But we think buying back shares will be a portion of the way we return capital to our shareholders.
Operator: Thank you. One moment, for our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Manav Gupta with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Manav Gupta: Good morning. I just wanted to go back to the decision of moving forward with the Traverse pipeline. So help us understand the demand here? And also, how do you see this partnership with MPLX and Enbridge evolving over a period of time?
Bobby Muraro: Ask that second part of that -- this is Bobby. Ask the second part of that question again.
Manav Gupta: How do you see the partnership with MPLX and Enbridge developing over a period of time?
Bobby Muraro: Got it. Well, I'm not going to comment on the partnership coming together and now they're going to work together. But at the end of the day, there's a lot of demand growth, a lot of supply growth going down into South Texas. Same thing into the KD market. We were excited to see that pipeline go FID. It was in the plan when Blackcomb was launched, but it was contingent around, obviously, enough demand going into that pipe going South. The commercialization of that pipe has gone really well. We're really excited about it going with Blackcomb landing down in Agua Duice and the amount of supply going down there is the LNG demand is coming online over time. We are excited to see those two markets, demand centers and supply centers getting connected with a big inch pipe. I think it will be good for Targa. It will be good for the producers. It will be good for the markets coming down there, so.
Manav Gupta: Perfect. My quick follow-up here is with the macro uncertainty, the valuations have come in. If Targa sees the right opportunity, would you be open to a small-scale bolt-on deals? I mean, you have a very attractive line of organic growth projects, but would you be open to small bolt-on deals if they meet your threshold return criteria?
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure. Yes, on the M&A question, I think our posture really remains unchanged to what it has been. We have a really good footprint and a lot of really attractive organic growth opportunities, which is going to be our primary focus. If there are opportunities to supplement organic growth with bolt-ons, I think we'll continue to look at that, just as we have over the last several years. I would say the bar remains high. We have a lot of good opportunities and growth opportunities in front of us. But yes, we'll continue to look for bolt-ons if there's something that makes sense, then we'll evaluate those.
Operator: Thank you. One moment, for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Keith Stanley: Last quarter, you said you thought Permian volume growth on your system would likely be even stronger in 2026 than 2025 and obviously, the macro has changed since then. What I'm curious about is you've pointed to a lot of commercial agreements and new plants starting up with commitments next year. Should we think of that as potentially providing some protection if the macro stays weak and helps to lock in some growth next year if activity slows?
Jen Kneale: Keith, this is Jen. I think what you're hearing from us is that so far this year is largely shaping up with expectations, and we're excited about the growth that we expect this year. I think when we think about 2026, what we're hearing from our major producer customers so far is the drilling programs are unchanged. Now clearly, there's going to be a lot of conversations between now and the end of the year and into Q1 of 2026 in producer boardrooms. But I think what we're saying is that we're really well-positioned because we're going to have a lot of growth this year, and that's going to result in us exiting 2025, at hopefully a pretty attractive cadence of growth that will help support into 2026. And then when we're talking about those commercial agreements that we signed in the fourth quarter of 2024, the point we're really trying to make is that those are really additive to the base growth that we were otherwise expecting for 2026 and part of 2025. So I think, yes, those help further support growth that we otherwise wouldn't have had if we hadn't entered into those agreements.
Keith Stanley: Great. Thanks. And second one, just the Q1 results were -- they're pretty solid given the volumes were down and down meaningfully in the case of frac. So it implies a pretty good pickup in unit margins across the Board. Any color you can give on that and if you're expecting continued stronger margins throughout the year?
Will Byers: Hey Keith, this is Will. There were several factors that drove the stronger results. But if you're looking on the G&P side, it was a little bit of contract mix and customer activity. Different people were off for different periods of time, and we had some higher margin contracts that delivered better margin as primary contributors.
Operator: Thank you. One moment, for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Theresa Chen: Good morning. There seems to be a bifurcation in the commentary from producers in terms of certain ones being more willing to be responsive to the uncertainty in the macro. I totally hear you, Jen, on no material changes thus far. Just curious on your asset -- sorry, customer composition at this point. What percent is public versus private, majors or large independents versus smaller players? Any color around there, please.
Jen Kneale: Good morning, Theresa. I don't think we're going to get into the sort of nitty-gritty specifics of how we want to break down our producer/customers. But I will say that certainly from our perspective, we're working with the biggest, the best, the most highly capitalized or most well-capitalized producers across the Permian, and that's part of what gives us a lot of confidence as we look forward as they continue to execute on their sort of multi-year drilling programs. I think that is something that, as a result of consolidation across the Permian over the last many years. We've really seen the majors become more meaningful players across the basin, and that's where we've got a lot of exposure along with the large independents. And so that's part of what's giving us, I think, at least a lot of comfort right now that when we think about the next several years, we're sitting in on a -- in a really good spot. But it really starts with the rock that our producers are sitting on and the inventory that our producers have. And ultimately, that's what we think is going to put all of us in a good position going forward. But certainly, for us, we believe that we are working with high-class producers, really strong positions that they are sitting on across the basin, both Midland side and Delaware side. And I think that's part of what differentiates Targa relative to some others.
Theresa Chen: Fair enough. And on the LPG export side of things, if there's not a carve-out for LPG amid the ongoing trade war. Can you talk about how this impacts the competitive landscape as some of your competitors have been very open about their brownfield and semi Greenfield economics and especially in light of new entrants into this part of the value chain towards the end of the decade?
Scott Pryor: Hi Theresa, this is Scott. Yes, as we talked about on our last earnings call, we talked about our brownfield project and how it will be very competitive in terms of the additions that it provides to our overall export capabilities as that comes online in the third quarter of 2027. When we look at the competitive landscape out there, really for us, it starts back to the wellhead. The wellhead obviously provides us a lot of opportunity for us to add gas processing plants, which as we walk through the lineup that we've got relative to the timing of plants that are coming online, the addition of our frac Train 11 and 12 in 2026 and 2027, respectively. All of that provides additional volume for us. So for us, it's really homegrown NGLs that are coming from the Permian Basin predominantly that are feeding into our pipelines that are feeding into our fractionation facility and then ultimately down to our docks at the facility. So yes, there's more expansions that are coming online. But again, we view it from the perspective of this is volumes that are coming off of our platform, and we want to keep them on the platform to feed across our export docks.
Operator: Thank you. One moment, as we move on to our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
John Mackay: Hey team, thanks for the time. I wanted to go back on a couple of things. Just first, appreciate the comments on kind of outer year CapEx flexibility. But if we go back to the numbers you framed up a year and a bit ago about being able to go down to $300 million of CapEx in a kind of flatter Permian environment. I guess given the bigger downstream projects you're working on right now, like effectively, when would you be able to get to kind of down to $300 million, let's say, if the macro does start to soften? Is that on the table for 2026? Is that 2028? Just frame up that kind of downside projection for us, please?
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure. No, that's -- as you think about our CapEx, it's really finishing up those larger downstream projects, which we see completing. And so it's fractionation Trains 11 and 12 and our export. And so those will be largely complete into 2026 in the early part of 2027. So if we are in an environment where, again, that if natural gas volumes are flat, it means crude oil is declining. And it was in that kind of environment, we said we think to stayed flat, it would be roughly about $300 million or so of capital that keeps flat. So it's really after our downstream projects, our major projects are online that we would then, if we're in that environment step down to that level.
John Mackay: All right. Got it. Thank you. And then maybe just circling back, I think it was a question Keith was asking, I'll just ask in a different way. For the next set of plants coming online, you've seen them come online pretty full in the past. I guess, is there anything you can frame up for us on how to think about these ramping as they come online? And then particularly, again, if we're in a softer macro environment, slower production growth environment, what that ramp could look like? Do you get some help from, I don't know, volumes currently being offloaded to a third-party? Anything like that you can frame up.
Matt Meloy: Sure. I'll start, and I've got Pat and Jen can jump in here. But what we've seen -- I'll talk about Midland and the Delaware. On the Midland side, whenever we brought on plans, they've been pretty full pretty quickly. That system really communicates well and we're able to depressure the system, bring on -- when we bring on additional capacity and it fills up relatively quickly. And I think that will be our expectation for our next plants across the Midland. Delaware, we're working on enhancing the communication between all of our different facilities. We're laying additional lines, and we're improving that. That one is probably a little bit more discrete, and it will depend a bit more just on the overall production growth we have between now and kind of through 2026 when those plants come on. So we still see those as highly utilized, much needed, but perhaps a little bit more, we call kind of white space on the Delaware side of things compared to the Midland. And it, of course, will depend on what our producers say they want to do into 2026 drilling plans and into 2027.
Operator: Thank you. One moment, for our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of AJ O'Donnell with TPH. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
AJ O'Donnell: Good morning, everyone. Just wondering if I could start with the Pembro II getting pulled forward. Just wondering if that is at all like kind of somewhat changed your outlook on volume expectations for the year? And if it has, was that pull-forward more customer driven? Or would you say it was more on your end with construction just finishing ahead of schedule?
Jen Kneale: Good morning, AJ. This is Jen. I'd say it's more of the latter. I'd say that our engineers do a really good job of forecasting when they expect projects to be online. But we also have a pretty good track record of being able to move projects forward a month or even a quarter as we get closer to nearing that date when they're expected online. And so this was just, frankly, we've been able to get it done a little bit more quickly than we previously forecasted.
AJ O'Donnell: Okay. And then maybe just one more question on the macro. I'm trying to figure out how you guys would anticipate the Permian production trending, say, fundamentals deteriorate a little bit more, and we have 50 to 55 WTI for a sustained period of time or maybe asked differently, in a flat oil environment, what do you think Permian gas production would do on an annual basis?
Pat McDonie: Yes. This is Pat. With increasing GORs, I've seen different numbers and our peers have stated different numbers. But I think there's 2% to 3% growth in gas over a flat crude oil environment, probably pretty good baseline. And certainly, I've heard higher numbers. So if you're flat on crude oil with current gas volumes, is that somewhere between 800 million a day to 1.2 Bcf a day growth in gas. That's kind of the range that I think you land in. And obviously, as Jen alluded to earlier, we feel like a lot of what's getting drilled is going to get drilled along Targa acreage. So we feel like that we're going to capture a larger percentage of whatever does get drilled and be in a good position for continued growth.
Operator: Thank you. And one moment, for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Sunil Sibal: Yes. Hi, good morning, everybody, and thanks for the color on the call. I just wanted to start off on the hedging position. I think you said you're hedged through 2026. Have you layered on additional hedges in the recent few months?
Jen Kneale: Sunil, this is Jen. I'd say that we're always continuing to add hedges. I think that we took a point of view previously when we stepped it up to be more than 90% hedged or at least 90% hedged through 2026 that was partially driven by a view of natural gas prices that we had. We've been continuing to add hedges since then, and we'll continue to add hedges going forward. I'd say that we are very disciplined around our hedging program and are more apt to add hedges than think about reducing our hedge exposure. And then of course, we have a lot of protections in place from our fee floors as well. So when we talk about our hedging program, we're generally not talking about a whole lot of margin that has exposure there. But hedges do allow us to even protect that piece of margin that does have that exposure.
Sunil Sibal: Okay. And then going back to the volume question a little bit, I hear that producers not changed their production plans. What is your sense in terms of talking to them at what kind of crude oil prices do you think there will be a response from their side in terms of change of drilling plans?
Jen Kneale: I think that every producer is different, Sunil. And ultimately, that's part of what are going to be a whole lot of Board discussions for each and every producer. I think that so far, we've frankly seen a mixed bag. We saw one smaller producer that added a rig, and we've seen one smaller producer that pushed some completions. In terms of the larger producers that would really be the needle movers on Targa systems, we're just hearing that they've got multi-year drilling programs underway, and there's no changes at this point in time. So I think each and every producer will evaluate their individual situation, their individual acreage, their individual contracts for services and other items that really impact their economics as well and then make the best decisions for them. We're well-positioned with the assets that we have in place to service all our producer customers. And we believe that our assets will be well utilized. And so I think that we're sitting in a really good spot. But ultimately, I think a lot is going to continue to shake out. It feels like every day, we've got a little bit of a changing environment here, so is to say where we'll end up when we finish this year. But I think that we've got really strong producers that are moving volumes onto our system. They are in an excellent position from a balance sheet perspective and that's part of what gives us a lot of confidence going forward in some level of continued activity.
Operator: Thank you. And I would now like to hand the conference back over to Tristan Richardson for further remarks.
Tristan Richardson: Thanks, Michelle, and thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. Statements made during this call that might include Targa's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings. Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer, Jen Kneale, President, and Will Byers, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, the following senior management team members will be available for Q&A: Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing, Scott Pryor, Logistics and Transportation, and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Matt.
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Tristan, and good morning, everyone. 2024 was a great year, and we are continuing to build on our momentum. Our 2024 results demonstrate our expectations, driving record NGL transportation, fractionation, and export volumes that also exceeded expectations. As we look forward to 2025 and beyond, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to continue to deliver significant growth for our shareholders. We have a demonstrated track record of adding infrastructure that is highly utilized, and 2024 was no different. With our additional two Permian processing plants, two additional NGL fractionators, and our Daytona NGL pipeline, all much needed at startup. And we announced three new projects this morning. Our Delaware Express project, a hundred-mile thirty-inch diameter intra-Delaware Basin pipeline expansion of Grand Prix that will provide us with additional NGL capacity in the Delaware, Train twelve, our next hundred and fifty thousand barrel per day NGL fractionator in Mont Belvieu, and our new LPG export expansion at Galena Park, which will increase our effective export capacity to nineteen million barrels. Our newly announced projects are needed to accommodate incremental NGL volumes from our five Permian processing plants currently under construction. These critical projects are core to Targa's strengths, positioning us to continue to demonstrate attractive returns on invested capital. We have recently accelerated projects and gross spending relative to our thoughts on when we would need additional downstream infrastructure. This was driven by more organic growth than previously estimated, plus the execution of multiple new commercial deals. In 2024, our Permian GMP volumes grew by 14% year over year with an incremental 709 million cubic feet per day moving through our system. Expected meaningful volume increases, but we were surprised to the upside as our growth far exceeded the high single-digit growth we were talking about last February. Our volume outperformance was really driven by a combination of the advantages of our Permian systems and dedicated acreage being on the best rock in the Midland and Delaware basins, lower declines on existing volumes, increased producer activity and performance in certain areas relative to initial expectations, higher gas-to-oil ratios, and commercial success bringing new volumes onto our system. We expect to continue to benefit from similar trends in 2025. We currently estimate that our Permian GMP volume growth will be more second-half weighted. This growth, along with several large commercial wins that began adding volumes late 2025 and into 2026, positions us to drive even stronger volume growth in 2026. These trends and the volume growth we expect to see on our system will drive further increases in year-over-year adjusted EBITDA and the generation of meaningful adjusted free cash flow. In 2024, our record adjusted EBITDA of $4.1 billion was 17% higher than 2023. We estimate another year of record financial and operational results in 2025 with over $600 million in EBITDA growth expected this year. We are also in position to deliver significant growth in 2026 and beyond, with four new Permian GMP plants coming online in 2026, driving significant NGL volume growth through our downstream assets. The strength of our results positions us to continue to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders, with over a 50% increase to our common dividend for 2024 versus 2023, and a record $755 million of common share repurchases. Looking forward, we announced in November we expect to recommend a 33% year-over-year increase to our annualized 2025 common dividend per share. Our focus isn't changing. Our balance sheet is strong, providing us with flexibility to continue to invest in attractive organic growth and to continue to return capital to our shareholders, including opportunistic common share repurchases. Before I turn the call over to Jen, I would like to recognize and thank our employees for their continued focus on safety and execution while providing best-in-class service and reliability to our customers. Every group within Targa played a huge role in our execution across the year, and we are proud of their efforts. We provided our shareholders with the ninth highest total return in the S&P 500, which is a tremendous accomplishment that we want to build on. Lastly, I am pleased to announce that Jen Kneale is moving into the president role effective March 1, 2025. After leading our finance and administrative functions for the last seven years, as part of Jen's continuing development, she is going to shift her focus to now lead our commercial engineering and operations functions across Targa. Over to you, Jen.
Jen Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Building on Matt's remarks, there is a lot of activity on our acreage in the Permian. Starting in the Delaware, our new Bull Moose plant is now online and highly utilized. We also completed the addition of our 800 million cubic feet per day front-end sour gas treating and a thirty-inch rich gas pipeline that connects Targa's two largest treating and processing facilities in the Delaware Basin. These projects bring Targa's Delaware treating capacity to approximately 2.3 billion cubic feet per day and create significant system fungibility. We are continuing to make progress on our next two plants that are under construction in the Delaware with our Bull Moose 2 plant expected online in the first quarter of 2026 and our Falcon 2 plant online in the second quarter of 2026. With two plants coming online within a quarter in 2026, we expect to be in great position to handle customer volume growth in the Delaware. Moving to the Midland Basin, our Greenwood 2 plant came online in late October and was fully utilized at startup. We currently have three additional plants under construction, with our Pembroke 2 plant expected online in the fourth quarter of 2025, our East Pembroke plant online in the second quarter of 2026, and our East Driver plant online in the third quarter of 2026. Across both the Midland and the Delaware, we are evaluating when we will need to move forward with our next Permian plants to accommodate continued growth on our systems. Turning to our logistics and transportation segment, Targa's NGL pipeline transportation volumes averaged a record and fractionation volumes averaged a record 1.1 million barrels per day during the fourth quarter as we benefited from our Daytona NGL pipeline and our Train 10 fractionator coming into service in late October. Our thirty-inch, one-hundred-mile intra-Delaware Basin expansion of Grand Prix that we announced this morning is needed to accommodate growing Delaware Basin volumes. Moving forward with a thirty-inch diameter pipeline, we have the flexibility to consider repurposing part of our existing Grand Prix NGL lines to large diameter gathering lines or residue service, providing the opportunity to further enhance flow assurance and takeaway options for our producers. Our outlook of increasing long-haul NGL transportation volumes has continued to strengthen, and Daytona coming online plus the third-party medium-term transportation deals that we mentioned previously provide us with flexibility looking forward. Given the anticipated growth in our Permian GMP business, our outlook for NGL supply growth remains robust, and our downstream system expansions will be much needed to handle growth from our systems. Our next fractionator in Mont Belvieu, Train 11, remains on track for the third quarter of 2026 and is expected to be much needed at startup. Our newly announced Train 12 is also expected to be much needed at startup, estimated in the first quarter of 2027. In our LPG export business at Galena Park, our loadings averaged a record 14 million barrels per month during the fourth quarter. We remain on track to complete our 650,000-barrel-per-month expansion in the fourth quarter of 2025. Given our fractionation expansions that will result in incremental propane and butane in the Targa system, plus the continued strength in global demand for US-sourced LPGs, we expect our LPG export expansion project announced this morning to be much needed when it comes online in the third quarter of 2027. The addition of a new pipeline between Mont Belvieu and Galena Park and another refrigeration unit will significantly increase our loading rate and enhance our facility flexibility. During the fourth quarter, we purchased BP's 12% interest in Cedar Bayou Fractionators for net cash consideration of approximately $111 million, and we now own 100% of CBF. This transaction allows us to provide our partner with liquidity while simplifying our operational structure at an attractive return. We also announced this morning a definitive agreement to repurchase all of the outstanding preferred equity in Targa Badlands LLC, which holds our North Dakota assets, for approximately $1.8 billion. We executed the Badlands transaction in February 2019. We were in the midst of building our largest project ever, Grand Prix, and multiple plants and fracs to help commercialize Grand Prix. We maximized proceeds without any TRGP dilution with the structure, which was critical to us at the time given our large capital lift and strength of conviction in our outlook. We have now taken out the last piece of creative financing that we utilized back then to keep investing without dilution. The rationale for taking out Blackstone now is simple. The preferred had a low double-digit cost, essentially $180 million of fixed annual charges. With the strength of our balance sheet, we can refinance it with much lower-cost debt, providing more than $80 million of annual cash savings and having minimal impact on our leverage ratio. We'll now own 100% of the Badlands again, which is a strong fee-based free cash flow asset. Characteristics that made it attractive for joint venture investment in 2019 make it attractive for us to fully own now. With an effective date of January 1, we will benefit from owning 100% of Badlands for all of 2025, resulting in approximately $180 million of incremental EBITDA. As Matt mentioned, we have accelerated significant spending into 2025 that we were not forecasting at this time last year because of the outperformance of volume growth in 2024 and our expectations for continued growth looking forward. Through the end of 2024, our ROIC over the past five years was 21%, which is strong given we had the second-largest project in Targa's history, Daytona, and several other major projects come online and only partially contribute to 2024. We provided an illustrative framework last February that detailed a multiyear growth capital spend of approximately $1.7 billion to support high single-digit growth in Permian volumes. While this framework holds, we clearly benefited from a lot more volume growth than that in 2024. And given our additional commercial success, we are likely to see more volume growth going forward. This growth accelerated several downstream projects, which added capital to 2025. The framework should continue to be helpful in a lower growth environment, but our capital spend over the next few years is likely to be higher. Four plants come online in 2026. We will need additional processing in 2027 and beyond, and that volume growth has accelerated downstream spend. Importantly, these projects are all core to Targa and leverage our existing footprint, and we believe will continue to result in attractive rates of return, driving increasing EBITDA and free cash flow over time. As a result of our strong returns and attractive growth, we continue to return meaningful increases in capital to our investors. We opportunistically repurchased $755 million of common shares at a weighted average price of $127.20 during 2024, a substantial increase over the $347 million of share repurchases for the full year 2023. In 2024, we returned 42% of our adjusted cash flow from operations to shareholders. This was higher than we expected at the beginning of last year, but the strength of our results positioned us to return capital to shareholders more quickly. Consistent with the multiyear framework we've previously discussed, we continue to model returning more than 40% of cash flow from operations to shareholders on a multiyear basis looking forward. We will continue to focus on an all-of-the-above approach, creating value for our shareholders, maintaining our strong balance sheet positions us to both continue to invest in attractive organic growth opportunities while increasing our return of capital to shareholders. Our compelling value proposition continues to be supported by growing EBITDA, meaningful increases to common dividends per share, a reducing share count, and an excellent outlook. 2024 was a big year for our company, and I'm so appreciative of the efforts of our employees. We have a lot of momentum and are excited about the future. I will now turn the call over to Will to discuss our fourth quarter results and our 2025 outlook.
Will Byers: Thanks, Jen. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $1.122 billion, a 5% increase over the third quarter. The sequential increase was attributable to higher Permian volumes, which resulted in higher system volumes through our integrated NGL business. Full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA was a record $4.1 billion, a 17% increase over 2023, and was supported by record financial and operational metrics across the company despite weak natural gas and NGL prices. We also benefited from stronger-than-expected natural gas and NGL marketing opportunities across 2024, with approximately $100 million of optimization opportunities that were not included in our original guidance. During 2024, we spent approximately $3 billion on growth capital projects. Growth capital spending came in ahead of our previous estimates as a result of the acceleration of spending attributable to our Permian commercial success and various growth projects that shifted spending into 2024. Our net maintenance capital was $232 million. At the end of the year, our net consolidated leverage ratio was below the midpoint of our long-term leverage ratio target range of three to four times. With our strong balance sheet, we have stable mid-triple B investment-grade ratings with each of the three rating agencies. Turning to 2025, we are very excited about our outlook and expectations. We estimate full-year 2025 adjusted EBITDA to be between $4.65 billion and $4.85 billion, a 15% increase over 2024 based on the midpoint of our range. We expect continued volume growth in the Permian Basin will drive operating margin across our businesses. The logistics and transportation segment is well-positioned to benefit from full-year contributions of our Daytona NGL pipeline and trains nine and ten. Our outlook assumes commodity prices of $1.55 per MMBTU for Waha Natural Gas, $0.65 per gallon for our weighted average NGL barrel, and $70 per barrel for WTI crude. Our cash flows are greater than 90% fee-based, and we have hedged about 90% of the remaining 10% non-fee margin through 2026. The increasing fee-based margin across our businesses will continue to provide us with cash flow stability, and the fee floors in our GMP business support our ability to invest across lower commodity price environments while positioning us to benefit from higher commodity prices. Relative to our full-year 2025 financial guidance, a 30% move higher in commodity prices would increase full-year adjusted EBITDA by around $130 million, while a 30% decrease would reduce adjusted EBITDA by around $80 million. This momentum will position us well going into 2026. We estimate $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion of growth capital spending for 2025, and our capital budget includes spending on the three new downstream projects announced today in addition to the five Permian plants and Train 11 currently underway, spending associated with the recent commercial success that Matt highlighted, modest spending associated with long lead time items for our next potential Permian system expansions, and we are continuing to evaluate when we will need to move forward with spending on incremental long-haul NGL transportation. As Jen mentioned, our third-party medium-term NGL transportation agreements provide us with flexibility and base load volumes for our next NGL pipeline expansion when needed. Our estimate for net maintenance capital spending is $250 million. Similar to year-end 2024, we expect to end 2025 with our leverage ratio comfortably within our long-term target range of three to four times, providing continued flexibility going forward. In February, we closed on a new five-year $3.5 billion revolving credit facility maturing February 2030. The upsized revolver enhances our liquidity position and flexibility to continue to execute on our strategic priorities. Our available liquidity at the end of the fourth quarter pro forma for the new revolver was approximately $1.5 billion. There is no change to our assumption that we may be subject to the federal minimum tax in 2026 and a full cash taxpayer in 2027. Any favorable tax policy changes by the new administration, such as reinstating bonus depreciation or eliminating AMT, would reduce our cash taxes relative to our expectations. I would like to join Matt and Jen in thanking our 3,400 employees who have made our success possible. It is a team effort every day as we continue to execute on our growth program. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Tristan.
Tristan Richardson: Thanks, Will. For the Q&A session, we ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up. And reenter the queue if you have additional questions. Latif, please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. Again, to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone. Our first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Your question, please, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning. Jen, congratulations there. First off, just wanted to go, I guess, into the forward outlook at this point with the guidance you provided. I believe there's commentary that activity would accelerate over the back half of the year. And if I think about the CapEx pull forward here, it seems like things are going better than previously expected, growing faster. I'm just wondering, any high-level thoughts you could share, I guess, on how the trajectory of EBITDA could grow across the year, the back half higher, and really how we should think about 2026 at this point given the trajectory later in the year, as well as some of these growth projects being pulled forward here. Thanks.
Matt Meloy: Yeah. Sure, Jeremy. I'll start. The growth outlook, I'd say, for us is really strong relative to where we were sitting last year at this time. I'd say the multi-year growth outlook has improved really for every year. As we look at this year specifically, we're pointing to more back-half growth. Last year, we saw really strong volumes the first part of the year, and that continued through the rest of the year. This year, as we look at our producer forecast, it is more back-half weighted, and the commercial success on the deals we talked about in 2024 really start contributing in the second part of 2025 and into 2026. This year is also for Q1 impacted by weather. We've had just round after round of freezing weather that's impacted our Permian volumes and then impacted our NGL volumes downstream. So we have had some weather headwinds here in the first quarter. But our outlook for this year is really strong, and we just kind of look through the bottoms-up build of our producer forecasts. 2026 looks like it's potentially even a stronger year than 2025.
Jen Kneale: And Jeremy, I just add, when you think about four plants coming online in 2026, we're not trying to look too far beyond this year. We're really excited about this year, but four plants coming online next year as well. We've just got a tremendously strong outlook of multi-years of growth here that we're really excited about.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. So 2026 looking better than 2025 at this point and long-term growth outlook today looking better than it did in the past. So got it there. And then I believe there were some comments on optimization that occurred in 2024 and is not, I guess, in the EBITDA guide for 2025. And obviously, you're not baking the business around this. But is there any reason to think that some optimization does not materialize again in 2025? Just wondering how we should think about that.
Jen Kneale: I would say that we're always pretty conservative when we guide to full-year EBITDA. And when we think about marketing opportunities and our footprint across both the natural gas and the natural gas liquid side, each year, opportunities present themselves, but it's not part of what we forecast in a meaningful way. We let those present. That's one of the reasons that in 2024, you saw us increase our guidance range in August, then you saw us in November say we thought we'd be at the high end of the range, and then you've, of course, seen us today beat all of that with where we ended up for 2024. So similarly, as we think about this year, expect opportunities to present themselves, but it's not something that we bake into our overall planning process until they're accounted for essentially.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. So optimization's still very much possible upside to the plan. I think that's it for me. Thank you very much.
Jen Kneale: Thanks, Jeremy.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Stanley of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, Keith.
Keith Stanley: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Wanted to start on the Badlands buy-in and just clarify, did Blackstone have an option to put the preferred interest back to you at a certain point, or is the timing just you have excess balance sheet capacity and, I think, Jen, you noted $80 million a year of cash savings from doing this, and so you're just opportunistic on it.
Jen Kneale: I'd say that what we announced today was us being opportunistic. And saying that from our perspective, with the strength of our balance sheet, with the cash savings from refinancing a higher-cost low double-digit preferred, being able to put it on our balance sheet at a much, much lower cost of debt, all made sense in the world to us, and we quantified the savings for you of around $80 million on the call. As with any structure like that, yes, there are eventual options for a partner like Blackstone to get out, but by no means were we anywhere where we had to make a decision. For us, it just was really on the backs of a really strong 2024 year-end leverage ratio of 3.4 times. We're taking a tiny bit of leverage here and generating $80 million cash savings and now go back to owning 100% of a stable fee-based asset that's throwing off a lot of free cash flow.
Keith Stanley: Great. Thanks for that. Second, I just wanted to ask on buybacks given some of the growth commentary, including 2026 potentially even being stronger than 2025. So when you think about buybacks and just capital allocation generally, the stock has regraded a lot. You're getting great returns on organic growth. You could probably get pretty good returns on M&A as well. So how are you thinking about prioritizing capital allocation at this point, including buybacks, just given kind of the overwhelming growth potential you're seeing?
Jen Kneale: For us, it continues to be an all-of-the-above approach. I think that we clearly have a lot of really attractive organic growth capital investment opportunities that we can invest in, and you're seeing us do that for our producers and customers. And that will, of course, be a core area of focus for us moving forward. While we're doing that, you also saw us execute on record repurchases in 2024, meaningfully increased the dividend in 2024. And now, of course, we have the investigation of a 33% increase to the common dividend in 2025. What we really like about our repurchase program is it's opportunistic. So to the extent we see a disconnect between our belief of the value of Targa and what the market is presenting itself or is presenting to us, we've got the financial flexibility with the strength of our balance sheet to step in. You saw us in 2024 execute a lot of repurchases in the second quarter. We knew how strong our 2024 was going to be. We were relying on volume growth showing up. It was showing up in spades even more than we expected. So you saw us step in because that was supporting a strengthening short, medium, and long-term outlook of growth. Similarly, we executed on a lot of great commercial opportunities. That's supporting an outlook of significant growth in 2026 and beyond. We've got a ton of conviction in what we have going on here and are really proud of our employees' execution across engineering, operations, commercial, accounting, everybody in the organization is moving in the right direction. And that means that as we look out over the short, medium, long term, our forecast is strengthening. And that's on the backs of really strong organic opportunities. And we've got the flexibility financially to execute opportunistically on repurchases when we think that it makes sense.
Keith Stanley: Thanks a lot.
Tristan Richardson: Alright. Thanks, Keith.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jackie Gallettis of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Jackie.
Jackie Gallettis: Hi. Thank you so much for the time. First, just wanted to start. You pointed to, you know, commercial success really driving, you know, some of the capital spending higher. You know, where are you seeing the success across your footprint? Just mostly on the sour gas opportunities, or is this, you know, more across, like, the entire GMP segment as a whole?
Matt Meloy: Yeah. Sure, Jackie. I'll touch on that, and then, Pat, if you want to jump in. I mean, I'd say we've really seen good commercial success in both the Midland and the Delaware. We actually included in our investor presentation this slide which highlighted what we characterize as three larger deals. All three of those were in the Delaware side of the basin. It just shows that there's still a lot of activity and a lot of acreage positions available. And we have millions of acres already dedicated. That's going to provide us nice growth. But we continue to execute and have some wins with our producer customers on, I'd call it, you know, kind of step-out acreage developments. And we've seen that on both sweet and sour. So I think the fungibility of our system being able to have a significant amount of treating for both CO2 and H2S, and the fungibility to continue to operate when plants are in maintenance just provides an overall very good level of service for our customers, and it's really paying off.
Pat McDonie: I think the only thing I would add is, as Matt alluded to in the investor presentation, really, the example we gave there was just illustrative. I mean, there is a long list of new transactions that we did in 2024, and I've already completed in 2025 that is adding to the overall acreage position that we have under contract and our growth going forward. And that's why when you listen to our prepared comments, etcetera, we say back-half loaded 2025 and 2026. We've got a lot of line of sight on, you know, the stuff we've had under contract, plus this new added acreage and drilling commitments that our producers are bringing to us. So we really are excited about, you know, the short and long-term outlook for our growth in the Permian Basin.
Jackie Gallettis: Got it. Appreciate that. And then just moving on to, you know, what the, you know, faster than expected Permian growth kind of implies, you know, looking at those, like, long lead items for potential Permian expansions and evaluating, you know, incremental additional long haul, you know, what is the cadence kind of of those additional beyond 2026 might look like? And, you know, at what point do you kind of expect to move forward with this additional infrastructure from here?
Matt Meloy: Sure. Yeah. Good question. And frankly, internally, we're trying to estimate and do the best we can for having the right amount of capacity and not too much and not too little. What you see is four plants coming on in 2026. That's higher than normal. If you look in 2025, we have two plants coming on. So you're kind of a three-plant average for those two. We're currently evaluating 2027 and 2028. We have multiple sites already picked out for new processing plants in the Delaware and Midland, and we're determining the best location and best timing for those. So I think as Jen mentioned, we gave a framework pointed to $1.7 billion of CapEx for, call it, two plants a year. I think what we're seeing is here in the short-medium term, it feels like we're higher than that. And that's why you've seen CapEx move higher, and it's accelerated some downstream spending, all of which is core to us. It's kind of right down our fairway of what we do, gather and process, and then handle the NGL volumes downstream. So, you know, we'll continue to kind of figure out what the right cadence for plants is. Two for 2025, we have four for 2026, and I'd say we're evaluating 2027 and 2028, but we see significant growth really in all of those years.
Jackie Gallettis: Yeah. Leave it there. Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Gupta of UBS. Please go ahead, Manav.
Manav Gupta: Good morning. My question here relates to you are obviously involved with the Permian gas egress pipeline. I'm just trying to understand the scope over there. Obviously, it looks like a very strong demand outlook driven by LNG, coal to gas switching, and data centers. So just trying to understand this entire conversation that you're having with the people about possibly investing more with Permian gas egress out there.
Bobby Muraro: Hi. This is Bobby. Yeah. As we announced our partnership with Water and Plaquemines, we're excited to get that done, excited to get that pipe online in 2026. We continue to talk to anyone and everyone about egress. Obviously, there's another pipe that got announced coming out of the Permian. That will help with egress of natural gas as well as supplying new demand from LNG and data centers. That team is out there figuring out what the next pipe is, where the next demand is, data centers, LNG, those conversations are ongoing constantly. And we're in that mix every day. So we're figuring out when that next pipe is needed, where that next demand center is, and as we evaluate some of that intra-Permian basin pipe we've got where we can deliver gas that can get burned at data centers or power plants in the Permian. So we're working on those things every day and all day and figuring that out. But excited to see Blackcomb come online in 2026 because it will be much needed when it does.
Manav Gupta: Perfect. Obviously, you have a very strong organic growth pipeline. Just trying to understand the appetite for some bolt-on deals also. And the reason I'm asking is one of your midstream slash refining peers is seeing some activist pressure to start divesting some of their midstream assets. I'm just trying to understand if there is what would be the appetite for small bolt-on deals that you could do.
Matt Meloy: Yeah. Sure. Yeah. In terms of gas takeaway, you know, we invested 17.5% in Blackcomb. And as we look at being part of the solution for additional takeaway in the Permian, I think there will be other opportunities afforded to us to invest in other pipes. And as Bobby mentioned, we're looking at multiple opportunities. When is the next one gonna be needed? And what would be an opportunity for us to make a commitment to a pipe and then have some investment opportunities? So yes, I'd say we will continue to look to invest in long-haul takeaway. We're also evaluating, we mentioned as we're putting in the Delaware Express thirty-inch NGL line. We have some Grand Prix pipeline in the Delaware, and we're evaluating whether we want to make those large diameter gathering lines or potentially making that residue lines as well to continue to aggregate natural gas residue from our plants to aggregate for additional long-haul pipe takeaway. So we do have additional opportunities on the residue gas side. And as we continue to grow, we'll continue to look to see if additional investments there make sense. And on the broader topic of M&A, I don't really think our posture has changed a whole lot. I mean, we have a lot of organic growth opportunities that we see. That is our primary focus. That is what we're gonna be spending most of our time on. We've looked at some of these bolt-on transactions. I'd say we have a high bar, and nothing, you know, has just either transacted with other parties or they've held. So we've continued to focus on organic growth. I think the bar for us continues to be high. And we'll just kind of continue, you know, continue on that path.
Manav Gupta: Thank you so much.
Bobby Muraro: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from AJ O'Donnell of TPH. Please go ahead, AJ.
AJ O'Donnell: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Maybe the first question is just on the outlook. Was wondering if you could spend a bit of time just talking about the expected returns on the projects that have been announced. Should we still be thinking about these around that five and a half times build multiple that you've guided before, or have they in any way changed?
Jen Kneale: Good morning, AJ. This is Jen. I'd say that everything that we provided in the framework before really holds, which is we've got a demonstrated track record of being able to do better than that five and a half times multiple and continue that track record going forward. Saw in 2024 the strength of our results with really weak commodity prices. To the extent we do ever see commodity price move higher on the natural gas and NGL side, we've got that asymmetric skew to the upside, which would provide incremental returns that you really haven't seen play out here recently despite us putting up really attractive rates of return on what we've invested in. So I think continuing to use the five and a half or a little bit better is a reasonable starting point as you're modeling out our business. Of course, we're working every day to figure out how to utilize those assets to drive those returns higher. I think what's been great for us is everything that we brought online has essentially been full at startup. Other than Daytona, which is an asset that we expect to ramp over time. But even the ramp there has been faster than expected, and that's why we've had to do some of those medium-term NGL transportation agreements. So part of how we get better with returns is that when assets come online, we've been able to commercialize the volume growth more quickly than when we made the FID decision, and the strength of our commercial team is certainly helping us to do that. And we'd expect that to continue going forward as well.
AJ O'Donnell: Okay. Great. Maybe just one more then on Q4 results and kind of talking about how these assets, you know, ramped into service pretty quickly. But just noticing that there was a pretty big step up in frac volumes versus NGL production. Just wondering if you could provide some comments on there. Was there any third-party step involved in that increase?
Scott Pryor: Hey, AJ. This is Scott. Yeah. We saw a really nice quarter in the fourth quarter. When you look at our volumes overall, when you look at fourth quarter 2023 to fourth quarter 2024, our volumes grew by 29% over that time frame. A lot of that was because we brought on frac train nine during the third quarter and then, of course, frac train ten came online in the fourth quarter. So that allowed us basically to utilize frac volumes that we had been offloading at times to other third parties. As well as our volume growth that we saw from all of our processing plants and then being able to work off inventory that we had stored. So all of that is really part of the benefit that we saw of the 1.1 million barrels that we saw during the fourth quarter. Needless to say, when you think about the number of plans that we've announced, on the Delaware side, on the plants that we've announced on the Midland side, and each of those plants contributes 35 to 40 thousand barrels a day of volume, much of which will be directed to our pipelines and much of which will be coming to our fractionators. That gives us line of sight and the reasons why train eleven was announced previously and today train twelve. So when you think about when those are coming online in the third quarter of 2026, and then, of course, frac train twelve now in the first quarter of 2027. All that lines up very well with the plant cadence that we've already announced today.
AJ O'Donnell: Okay. Thanks for the color. I'll turn it back.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Bloom of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Michael.
Michael Bloom: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I had two questions on volumes. I'll just stack them here together. The first is on the fourth quarter. Your Permian volumes sequentially were up only a little bit, you know, only modestly Q3 to Q4, and that's despite that you've been bringing on plants in the second half of the year. So just wanted maybe you could just talk a little bit about any dynamics going on that we should be aware of there. I thought maybe the volumes would be a bit higher. And then for the full year, you said you grew volumes overall 14% in 2024. What does guidance assume in 2025 for volume growth?
Jen Kneale: Related to the fourth quarter Permian volumes, I mean, the trajectory of growth that we've been on was pretty staggering when you think about moving across the year and volumes moving up 277 million cubic feet a day Q2 to Q1, and 311 million cubic feet a day Q3 to Q2, and then the 83 million cubic feet a day of growth Q4 relative to Q3, we tried to call it out in our press release quarter over quarter commentary. We did have a low-margin contract that rolled over at the very beginning of the fourth quarter. So that's what was going to create some of that noise quarter to quarter, but we certainly wanted to make sure that we highlighted for you. I'd say that when we think about our growth 2025 relative to 2026, we had the Bull Moose plant just come online. We've got another plant that comes online later this year. We've talked about a back-half ramp. We're certainly above that low, that sort of high single-digit framework that we said underpinned the growth in the $1.7 billion case that we published last February. I'd say expect higher growth than that. 2024 was a really strong year. We're really pointing to 2026 and the four plants as our next strong year, but we're gonna continue to have really attractive Permian growth across 2025 as well. Again, just trying to remind everybody, we're gonna see a lot of that growth materialize back half because as Matt said, that's when a lot of those commercial agreements arrangements really start to ramp up in a back half 2025 and then provide significant incremental growth in 2026. Which is what is underpinning the four plants in 2026.
Michael Bloom: Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Please go ahead, Neal.
Neal Dingmann: Morning. Thanks for the time. My first question, you asked for just wanna ask maybe a different way on the Badlands deal. I understand the lower cost of capital and financial ability there. Just wondering maybe how this fits into the overall integrated NGL strategy. And if, you know, again, of course, for the right price, would you all consider selling this asset?
Matt Meloy: Yeah. You know, what's interesting about the Badlands is, you know, our strategy is obviously to invest in gathering and processing and move the NGLs into our downstream footprint. We actually get those NGLs into our fractionator. You know, we don't have transport all the way up to the Badlands, but it is tied into our fractionation, and then those volumes are available for export. So we do get some synergies from the NGL downstream business on the Badlands. You know, with us, you know, refinancing at a lower cost debt, any option that we would have to do anything up there, whether it's a partner or something strategic, those are frankly a little bit easier with us owning 100% of it. So it doesn't change any of the dynamics about what's the best way for Targa to look at all of its assets. Right? So now if anything, it kind of improves that position.
Neal Dingmann: Sure. Love the flexibility. And then second question, maybe just on your North Texas Mountain Valley NGL pipeline. I'm just really wondering, what's the timing and when would you all need new capital there, maybe along with, you know, how you all are using offloads to bridge that need?
Scott Pryor: Yeah. Well, first off, obviously, we announced the Delaware Express line. That is, just to give a little bit more description on that, that line is a thirty-inch line that will basically allow us to move the incremental growth that we're seeing on the Delaware Basin side. In the fourth quarter, we had about 390,000 barrels of NGL production in the Delaware. Much of that was moving on Grand Prix. When you think about the number of plants that we're adding on the Delaware side, with Bull Moose 1, Bull Moose 2, and Falcon 2, all of which will be online in the second quarter of 2026. That volume will find its way and be necessary to move on our Delaware Express, which ties into Daytona and Grand Prix. Our capacity all the way into Bellevue with our South leg is about 1.1 million barrels per day. We moved 872,000 barrels a day on Grand Prix during the fourth quarter. So still have some operating leverage there. And then certainly, the third-party offload deals that we've done allow us to ramp into our cadence of plants and give us a lot of flexibility on when we would need to announce a further long-haul pipe. It's certainly something that we're looking at, trying to stay in front of, and again, with our success that we're seeing on our upstream plant adds, it's something that obviously we've alluded to in our notes. That we're studying that hard.
Neal Dingmann: I'm sure you all stay in front of everything. Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Theresa Chen of Barclays. Please go ahead, Theresa.
Theresa Chen: Thank you for taking my questions. Looking more to the medium term, as you see, you know, visibly, the strong, you know, back half acceleration in 2025, tying into the four plants coming up next year. I'm curious if you can quantify in any way how strong is strong growth in 2026 from a volumetric perspective as you look at your inlet volumes. And then, you know, beyond that, clearly, you're in a period of accelerated and above-average growth and CapEx, including the downstream infrastructure that needs to come online. But based on what you see today, when do we kind of revert back to normal, if ever? Would love to get your thoughts there.
Matt Meloy: Yeah. Sure. You know, part of it, you know, giving multi-year volume guidance is difficult. I mean, as you saw in 2024, we thought we had a good estimate, and we far exceeded that. Producers ended up being more active. Wells came on better. GORs increased, but they didn't decline as much. So we saw a good outperformance in 2024. Part of what goes into 2026 is also just how strong things do ramp in the back half of 2025 and what our exit is for 2025. So that's why we're not giving 2026. When you just look at it on an annual basis, we see higher year-over-year in 2026. We still see strong growth in 2025, I'd say not as strong as we saw in 2024. It's definitely south of that. We still see pretty strong growth in 2025. But just the indicators we're getting is from the commercial success we've had and just the drilling plans we currently have from producers, it's looking like that back half of 2025 is setting up very nicely for 2026. And then, yeah, when you get into kind of more normal capital cadence, you know, we have some, again, some chunkier downstream projects that we've announced here this morning, you know, with the export terminal, an additional frac, you know, we have train nine and ten just came on. We have eleven and twelve. We have a looping out in the for the Delaware Express. You know, once a lot of those get in service, you know, you could expect to see, you know, again, after this next build cycle on the downstream side, perhaps lower CapEx games at that point. But we're still sorting through what that looks like and what it's all gonna be dependent on what the volume growth is on the GMP side.
Theresa Chen: Understood. And turning to the export component of your infrastructure value chain, completely understanding that these, you know, supply push purity products need to move and you will collect the fees on the growing volumes. But also curious to hear your view on the ebbs and flows of demand from your international customers.
Scott Pryor: Hey, Theresa. This is Scott. You know, first off, when you look at just the tremendous growth that we've seen with LPG volumes coming out of the US, and, you know, in just less than ten years, the LPG market has grown two and a half to three times in that time frame. And then when you look at the market share that the US has today, it's grown from 29% to 46% just in that time frame as well, and that's, again, on a growing volume. We would expect that trend to continue. There is still, you know, a vast majority of volumes that can find their way predominantly to the Asian marketplace and to growing market centers that are out there for LPG. That's both on the propane and on the butane side. There's a number of countries, obviously, that are still in need of mobile fuel. Fuel that is clean burning and efficient. And that's something that the LPG molecule provides in a very effective manner. So we would just see that trend continue. And so for us, when we look at our export expansion project, you know, it's an expansion that includes a pipeline. It includes a refrigeration unit. And all of that is at a cost of just less than $400 million. So that is a very attractive project for us. It provides the ability for us to continue to compete and make sure that the volumes stay on our system and can be exported to the marketplace.
Theresa Chen: Thank you very much.
Scott Pryor: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Bingham of Scotiabank. Please go ahead, Brandon.
Brandon Bingham: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions here. I just wanted to quickly go back on the strong Permian activity for this year and then sort of the near-medium-term outlook. You know, wanted to just more specifically focus in and ask if there's been any discussions with customers or if there's any contemplations within the development schedules that you're getting for delineation efforts on deeper benches in the basin and if that's something that could potentially be a tailwind to your outlook this year or outer years.
Pat McDonie: Yeah. This is Pat. It's kind of a loaded question, just to be frank. But certainly, when you think about the Permian, you know, the primary benches have been Wolfcamp related, etcetera. Right? We are definitely seeing some parties on both the Delaware and Midland side now look at the Woodford Barnett, which is a little bit deeper horizon. And, you know, I would say that we're in the initial stages of that getting tested and drilled up. Probably a little bit ahead in the Delaware relative to Delaware versus the Midland. And then certainly in both sides of the basin, there's multiple horizons that, for different reasons, you know, either the quality of the rock relative to the other benches or, you know, a sour component in the Delaware that have waited to be developed, and frankly, there's good economics with all of those. And the expectation is they will get developed over time. But, you know, I guess the short answer is, yeah, we are seeing a little bit of interest in the deeper horizons, and, you know, we'll see how that plays out.
Brandon Bingham: Got it. Thank you. And then if we could just quickly go back to shareholder return. I know it was previously asked about buybacks, but just kind of thinking through that and how you see it shaping up this year with, you know, the stock above where you executed the buybacks in Q4. Just how all that fits in with the 40% to 50% payout target and if you might consider any other alternative levers like a special dividend or something, you know, understanding you don't want to get the base dividend too high taking it through the cycle sort of approach there. But yeah, just how you guys are thinking through that with where the stock currently sits today?
Jen Kneale: Brandon, this is Jen. I'd say that it's really consistent with how we've been thinking about it going all the way back to when we put our share repurchase program in place in the third quarter of 2020. With a strong balance sheet, we've got a lot of flexibility. Really, since then, we have been buying each quarter at higher prices than the previous quarter. Irrespective of a couple of quarters where maybe we saw a little bit of dislocation and that's where you really saw us step in. We've got a really strong short, medium, and long-term outlook. And we continue to have conviction that we can provide our shareholders with an increasing return of capital from utilizing that share repurchase program. But we really like the fact that we get to report it after we've executed on it. And so I don't think you're going to hear us come out and say this is how you should think about it quarter to quarter or this is what we're forecasting for this year or next year. I think that the 40% to 50% framework holds, and that's a combination of dividends and thoughts on opportunistic repurchases that we have running through our model. And that, of course, is a multiyear framework. We got above 40% in 2024. I think we've got expectations that we'll continue to return a meaningful increase in capital to shareholders as we move forward through time. And it will be a combination of dividends and repurchases, but what you're definitely hearing us say is we value flexibility. And we value balance sheet strength, and we value the ability to continue to invest in high-returning organic growth capital projects. And then we value the fact that we can return capital to our shareholders as well. And I think that all-of-the-above approach has really worked well for us. And so we really don't see a need to change it as we look forward.
Brandon Bingham: Awesome. Yeah. I agree. Thank you so much.
Jen Kneale: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harry Mateer of Barclays. Your line is open, Harry.
Harry Mateer: Hi. Good morning. I want to talk about the balance sheet a little bit. So the narrative about leverage has been very consistent from you for the past few years. It's at 3.0 to 4.0. But you also previously messaged a preference to be in the lower half of that range. So with CapEx now expected to be higher in the next few years, I'm just wondering how we should think about the prospects for Targa being in the lower half of that range on leverage in the near to medium term.
Jen Kneale: Morning, Harry. This is Jen. I think that's still definitely our preference. But I think that consistent with what we've also said before, we don't see a need to force our way there. We ended 2024 at 3.4 times. The Badlands repurchase takes us a little bit higher. But then as we look out over the next several years, what we really like is the trajectory of our leverage fairly quickly coming down into that lower end of the 3 to 3.5 times. But at the end of the day, we're very comfortable managing this business where we currently are from a leverage ratio perspective. But I do think that just as a natural movement through the current growth capital cycle, as these projects come online, we benefit from meaningful increases in year-over-year EBITDA contributions, our leverage ratio will just naturally move down towards that lower end of the 3 to 3.5 times.
Harry Mateer: Okay. Thanks. And then, you know, with you consolidating Badlands and optimizing cost of capital, just wondering generally any thoughts on more comprehensively addressing some of your higher-cost debt given you do have some callable notes with coupons that, you know, are still off-market versus where your bonds trade today.
Jen Kneale: I think we're always looking at how best we can essentially save money across our entire organization, and the finance team is held to that same level of accountability, which says, if there are opportunities to take out higher-cost debt, then certainly we'll evaluate it. Right now, we've got more than a billion dollars drawn on our revolver. We've got, of course, the balance of the Badlands repurchase. So probably more focused short term on helping to manage that liquidity position, but we're always looking at those higher coupon callable notes and trying to assess what the right time may be to bring them in and refinance either utilizing our new revolver or potentially terming out. That'll be a consistent evaluation by our finance team.
Harry Mateer: Okay. Thanks, Jen.
Jen Kneale: Thanks, Harry.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Sunil Sibal. Please go ahead, Sunil.
Sunil Sibal: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for the time. I wanted to start off on the capital program. It seems like, you know, inflation in the US continues to be sticky, and if tariffs come into play, you know, the cost to build anything in the US is probably going up. I was curious, you know, how that environment you, you know, manage your returns on new investments. Are you able to pass on all this potential cost to customers or any risk management aspects of your capital program?
Matt Meloy: Yeah. Sure. Hey, Sunil. Yeah. You know, we've actually seen steel prices move up here. Just kind of the talk of tariffs. We have seen that happen. No. It impacts our capital cost, whether it's like processing plant or NGL pipe we're putting in place as steel prices move up. It does impact our overall CapEx budget. But as you look at the steel cost as a percent of an overall processing plant or an NGL pipe, it's, you know, it's a modest contribution. So then you have a per percent increase on a modest contribution of the overall CapEx. I'd say it's a manageable, you know, a manageable headwind on any of these projects. We'll still get good returns. We've actually worked with some of the on some of our projects working in supplying US steel, so we aren't subject to the tariff. So our procurement group is managing it. It will be a bit of a headwind, but I think it's a manageable one.
Sunil Sibal: Okay. Thanks for that. And then on the NGL export side of things, seems like the competitive landscape is heating up a bit. You obviously announced this significant expansion today. I was curious, you know, if you could talk about the competitive landscape there. And I remember correctly, you know, I believe you were most targeting the Latin American market. Has that changed recently?
Matt Meloy: Yeah. Sure. I'll start, and then Scott, you can add on. The NGL LPG export market is competitive. So there's multiple players. So with another facility being built, it's competitive now. It'll be competitive when another one gets built. So we've been able to manage and do quite well with our we have a really good team. We move our volumes from our system across our dock, and we expect to continue to do that. Scott, anything to add?
Scott Pryor: And I would just add that, again, from our comments earlier, this is a very attractive brownfield project for us. Again, it's less than $400 million to add a pipeline from Mont Belvieu down to Galena Park, along with a new refrigeration unit. Gives us a lot of operating leverage going forward, complements our overall business all the way back to the wellhead. When we look at contracting for this, we always stay very well contracted. We do a tremendous job with our export team of renewing existing contracts, adding new contracts both long-term and short-term in certain situations. And as it relates to this project, it's only online in the third quarter of 2027. It's needed because it fits very well with the cadence of plants, pipelines, and fractionation that we need to move the LPGs across our dock. So we'll continue to contract heavily and take advantage of that marketplace. I also like the fact that we've got a number of contracts where the volume actually ramps up over time. That's it. This new expansion project. So we feel very comfortable with our project and the market share that we have today. And again, the US is continuing to dominate the overall export market in general, and it will continue to grow.
Sunil Sibal: Thanks for the color.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Tristan Richardson for closing remarks. Sir?
Tristan Richardson: Thanks, operator. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We appreciate your interest in Targa Resources.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-05 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Targa Resources Corp Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Webcast and Presentation. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Tristan Richardson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Fundamentals. Please go ahead, sir.
Tristan Richardson: Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, and welcome to the third quarter 2024 earnings call for Targa Resources Corp. The third quarter earnings release, along with the third quarter earnings supplement presentation for Targa Resources that accompany our call are available on our website at targaresources.com in the Investors section. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. Statements made during this call that might include Targa's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings. Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer; Jen Kneale, President, Finance and Administration; and Will Byers, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, the following senior management team members will be available for Q&A: Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Matt.
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Tristan, and good morning to everyone. Before we get started, I want to welcome Tristan Richardson to Targa. Tristan will be leading our Investor Relations and Fundamentals functions after previously working in energy sell-side research for the last 13 years. With Tristan and Sanjay, we are in excellent position to continue to support our investors, analysts and potential investors with our best-in-class team. The third quarter was very strong on a number of fronts, record volumes, record adjusted EBITDA and continued execution across our footprint, which sets us up well for the balance of this year and provides a lot of momentum as we turn to 2025. Given our outperformance through the first 9 months of the year, we expect to beat the high end of our previously provided adjusted EBITDA range, which means more than $500 million of year-over-year growth, exceeding the midpoint of our initially provided guidance range for 2024 by more than $250 million. Over the past several years, we have deliberately taken steps to successfully position Targa across volatile markets, and we are benefiting from those steps. We have largely removed exposure to downside commodity prices, with 90% of our margin now fee-based or supported by fee floor contracts. We have continued to invest in growth capital and attractive opportunities with best-in-class customers with a focus on deals that allow us to move volumes all the way through our integrated system. We have significantly strengthened our balance sheet, and are now a strong investment-grade credit across all 3 agencies. We have returned an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders while maintaining financial flexibility. We believe that these important steps enhance our abilities to generate attractive returns for our shareholders across commodity price cycles. Our excitement around Targa's short-, medium- and long-term outlook begins with our Permian position, and there are a lot of good things going on there. Our new plants have continued to come online, essentially full and given our expectation that our plans in progress will do the same, today, we announced that we are moving forward with our next 2 new Permian plants in response to higher anticipated growth we are seeing and to ensure we keep pace with our producers. We are continuing to enhance our sour gas treating position in the Delaware Basin with additional investments in front-end treating and AGI infrastructure. Our new 800 million cubic feet per day sour gas treater and injection well comes online in early 2025 at our Bull Moose complex, which, along with our current 6 active acid gas injection wells, will increase our treating capacity to over 2.3 billion cubic feet per day in the Delaware. Additionally, we are utilizing and enhancing existing infrastructure to capture and sequester CO2 in the Permian, and we'll be accruing some 45Q tax credits in the fourth quarter of this year and increasing over time. Our Permian growth drives increasing volumes through our downstream assets. Daytona was much needed when it came online. Train 9 has been full since it came online. And Train 10 and GCF are much needed and will be highly utilized. Our premier Permian supply aggregation position, coupled with our integrated NGL system, positions us nicely to continue to generate strong returns on our invested capital and be able to continue to return increasing capital to our shareholders over time. Before I turn the call over to Jen to discuss operations and capital allocation in more detail, I would like to extend a thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution while continuing to provide best-in-class service and reliability to our customers. The growth we are experiencing requires a lot of coordination across our organization, and we are proud of our employees.
Jen Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Let's talk about the strength of our operational results in more detail. Starting in the Permian, our natural gas inlet volumes averaged a record 6 billion cubic feet per day during the third quarter, a 5% increase when compared to the second quarter. Versus last year, our Permian volumes were up 18%, over 900 million cubic feet per day or more than 3 full plants, driving record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes. Our G&P volume growth has led to an acceleration of timing of our processing plants, including the two that we announced today. In Permian Midland, our new Greenwood 2 plant commenced operations in early October, essentially full. Our next Midland plant, Pembrook 2 and East Pembrook, will be much needed and remain on track to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2025 and second quarter of 2026. The new Midland plant that we announced this morning, East Driver, is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of 2026. In Permian Delaware, we are continuing to benefit from increasing volumes. Our next Delaware plant, Bonus and Bonus 2, will be much needed and remain on track to begin operations in the first quarter of 2025 and the first quarter of 2026. Our next new Delaware plant, Falcon 2, is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2026. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. Targa's NGL pipeline transportation volumes averaged a record 829,000 barrels per day, and fractionation volumes averaged a record 954,000 barrels per day during the third quarter. Our NGL transportation and fractionation volumes increased 6% sequentially as we benefited from increased supply from our Permian G&P systems. Given the anticipated growth in our Permian G&P business and corresponding plant additions, our outlook for NGL supply growth is robust, and our downstream system expansions are very much needed to handle growth from our systems. Our next fractionator in Mont Belvieu, Train 11, remains on track for the third quarter of 2026. In our LPG export business at Galena Park, our loadings averaged 12.4 million barrels per month during the third quarter despite our volumes being impacted by a required 10-year inspection that reduced our loading capability from mid-June through late July. We see continued strength in global demand for U.S.-sourced LPGs, and we remain on track to complete our next expansion, which will increase our loading capacity an incremental 650,000 barrels per month in the second half of 2025. Turning to capital allocation. Our priorities remain the same, which are to maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet, to continue to invest in high-returning integrated projects and to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles, and we are delivering on those priorities. We are returning meaningful increases in capital year-over-year to our investors. We opportunistically repurchased $168 million of common shares during the third quarter. Through 3 quarters, we have repurchased nearly $650 million of common shares at a weighted average price of $121.50, a substantial increase over $347 million of share repurchases for full year 2023. Our year-to-date repurchase activity means we are in a position to return 40% to 50% of our adjusted cash flow from operations to shareholders this year. This is an acceleration versus previous expectations, driven by the outperformance of the business and our strengthening outlook. We are pleased to announce this morning that we expect to recommend to our board an increase to the 2025 annual common dividend to $4 per share, a 33% increase over the 2024 dividend level. This provides our shareholders with a meaningful year-over-year increase while continuing to maintain our flexibility. Beyond 2025, we expect to be in a position to continue to provide meaningful annual increases to our common dividend per share. We believe that we offer a compelling value proposition for our shareholders and potential shareholders. Growing EBITDA, a growing common dividend per share, reducing share count and excellent short-, medium- and long-term outlooks. We also recently published our 2023 Sustainability Report. Our report reflects that we take our responsibilities of being an operator of critical natural gas and NGL infrastructure seriously and celebrates the continued hard work of our employees. We look forward to your feedback. I will now turn the call over to Will to discuss our third quarter financial results. Will?
Will Byers: Thanks, Jen. Targa's reported adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was a record $1.07 billion, a 9% increase over the second quarter. The sequential increase was attributable to higher Permian volumes, which resulted in higher system volumes across our integrated NGL business and to continued natural gas and NGL optimization opportunities in our marketing business. The adjusted operating margin for our Gathering and Processing segment set another quarterly record of $788 million as a result of the strength of volume growth supported by our fee and fee floor contracts. Our Logistics and Transportation segment also set another quarterly record with adjusted operating margin of $717 million, backed by record NGL transportation and fractionation throughput. As Matt mentioned, we now estimate full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be above the top end of our previously disclosed $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion range. We anticipate a strong finish to 2024 as our recently completed expansions and capacity additions across Permian G&P and NGL transportation and fractionation support continued volume growth. For the third quarter, our net maintenance capital spending was approximately $60 million. Our current year estimate for net maintenance capital spending remains $225 million. Our net growth capital spending was approximately $700 million for the quarter. Our net growth capital spending for 2024 will depend on our ability to order certain long lead time items before year-end. Among other factors, we currently expect spending to modestly exceed $2.7 billion. The acceleration of spending on infrastructure to handle additional volume growth is expected to increase our net growth capital spending for 2025 and contribute to higher adjusted EBITDA when the incremental plants we announced today are in service in 2026. We continue to expect a meaningful inflection in 2025 free cash flow generation relative to 2024, and we'll provide additional details on 2025 growth capital spending in February once we are fully through our planning process. In August, we extended the maturity of our $600 million accounts receivable securitization facility to August 2025. And we successfully completed a $1 billion note offering of 5.5% coupon senior notes due 2035. The notes offering allowed us to enhance our liquidity position by reducing borrowings under our commercial paper note program, a portion of which was incurred to repay the remaining $500 million outstanding under our prior $1.5 billion unsecured term loan facility which was terminated in May 2024. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $1.9 billion of available liquidity. And our net consolidated leverage ratio was approximately 3.6 times, well within our long-term leverage ratio target range of 3 times to 4 times. Moody's upgraded target to Baa2 in early October, reflective of the progress we have made to date and our outlook for the future. We have now achieved upgrades from all 3 agencies in 2024 and have mid BBB ratings and a stable outlook at each of the 3 rating agencies. Maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet remains a priority at Targa. Having been at Targa for a little over 3 months now, I am humbled every day by the dedication and tremendous work ethic of the employees of Targa. I'm grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this exceptional team. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Tristan.
Tristan Richardson : Thank you, Will. For the Q&A session, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up and reenter the queue if you have additional questions. Michelle, please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Theresa Chen: Congratulations on the fundamental growth and the accelerated pace of growth over the near term. I was curious, as we look to 2025 CapEx and general capital allocation plans, can you provide more color on how long do you expect this accelerated growth to endure? And B, how high could CapEx go to in 2025?
Matt Meloy: Yes. No, we're excited about the results today. We're really excited just about the overall performance we've seen so far this year and it's just translating into higher EBITDA growth, higher volumes across our G&P footprint in the downstream. We think that really sets us up well as we look into 2025. In terms of capital spending, as we look to 2025, we've certainly seen an acceleration on the Gathering and Processing side of things. It's resulted in more field level capital for this year, and it's likely to continue into next year, additional pipelines, additional compression, but it's also resulted in acceleration of our plant timing. Earlier in this year, we had a estimate of when we're going to be putting plants on for the next 12, 24, 36 months, and that has accelerated just as our volumes have moved significantly higher. Third quarter was up $900 million a day versus third quarter of last year. We were expecting growth this year, but not that level of growth. So we think that really just puts us in a good position as we go forward. So accelerating Falcon 2 plant and East Driver plant, that's going to drive more capital in 2025. We don't have a number we're going to give you yet. We're still going through our planning process. We plan to give you more details of what our G&P spending is, cadence of any additional plants and our plant timing in February. And on the downstream side, what ultimately that means when those plants come on, generate more NGLs, what that's going to mean for our Downstream business. So that's kind of the planning we're going through now, and we plan to give you more color on that in February.
Theresa Chen: And looking at the downstream throughput across your doc, clearly seeing an uptick following a partial downtime in third quarter and fourth quarter looks extremely robust. Can you just provide a forward outlook on how you expect this to trend? How much of it at this point do you think it's going to be seasonal versus just the relentless supply push of molecules across your docs through the integrated NGL value chain?
Scott Pryor: Theresa, this is Scott. First off, yes, we had a nice quarter during the third quarter. It was a nice rebound from what we had in the second quarter of this year. So a lot. Even though it was impacted, the second quarter was impacted by the vessel inspection that we had and that lingered into the month of July. So when we look at the back half of third quarter, we certainly had significant increase over the months. And we would see that continuing as we move into the fourth quarter now that we've got the full complement of all of our refrigeration capacity. So I would anticipate during the fourth quarter that the volumes would be very complementary, if not exceed what we saw in the third quarter. We continue to benefit from a variety of sources of demand, both of it on the propane side as well as on the butane side. And we're utilizing really not only our VLGC docs, but we're using some of our smaller docs that complement MGCs and LGCs and moving to markets that are closer than, say, the Far East. So a lot of that benefited as we looked across the third quarter then into the fourth quarter. Moving into 2025, I think it's going to be very much the same story. We benefited as an industry with a number of vessels that have come online, both in '24 and now in '25. We'll continue to see more vessels delivered to the marketplace on both the VLGC side as well as the MGC side. So I think it's just setting itself up to where right now, freight is relatively low, and it puts us in a position to where it's easy to fund supply from the U.S. into the markets across the world.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jeremy Tonet: So out of the producer activity, I think the producers in the basin, I think we've heard some mixed messages with regards to, I think, the integrated versus large independents versus smaller. And just wondering if you could share a bit more on your conversations with producer customers here and particularly how your New Mexico position, I guess, differentiates you from others in the basin?
Matt Meloy: Yes. Jeremy, this is Matt. I'll start, and then Pat, if you want to add on. The discussions we're having with producers, it is a mix. The small, mid, large cap, that's -- we have a portfolio of customers, and it's not all the same. But what we are seeing generally is more growth on the gas side relative to their expectations. So we haven't necessarily seen more activity, but we have just seen the wells be more productive. And whether that's lower declines, increasing GORs, higher IPs, we're just seeing more volumes. We continue to be surprised this year to the upside on gas volumes. And as we look out, we're sorting through our producer forecast right now, what that's going to mean for '25, '26 growth. We think there's going to be significant growth. Kind of where exactly that falls out is kind of what we're working through right now. But I think we remain bullish on the outlook for natural gas growth across our footprint. As you look to New Mexico, we've had a really good footprint in the Delaware for some time. But I would say when we acquired the Lucid assets in 2022, to us, they had the best Delaware footprint. And so that fit nicely into our systems that we had. We were able to integrate those systems. And I think when you look at just the rigs, where the activity is, we're kind of have a best-in-class system across the Delaware with a complement of Lucid. So I think we're in a good position to capture the strong activity in the New Mexico area.
Patrick McDonie: No, I was going to say, the only thing I'd add is, Matt's right. With the Lucid acquisition, it was definitely a step-up for us in the Delaware. And the steps we've taken to integrate that system into our other Delaware systems and the sour gas infrastructure that we've built out have led to a lot of commercial success. The Delaware Basin is growing rapidly. There's a lot of gas over there, and we're positioned very well to take advantage of that.
Jeremy Tonet: And then kind of continuing here as it relates to the gas picture and gas egress from the basin. We have a couple of projects in motion at this point, you're part of 1 of them. How do you think about, I guess, the picture for future gas egress needs in the basin, when do you think that could materialize next? And what do you think Targa's involvement could be here?
Robert Muraro: This is Bobby. I think we announced our partnership with Blackcomb a little bit ago, we're excited about that project moving forward and it's going well. I think we said before and we'll continue to say, we want to see as much egress out of the basin happen as possible. We know there are a lot of other pipes that are in the works right now. We were thinking about '28 when we were working on the '26 pipe with Blackcomb. So we continue to work on what is needed going forward. With what we're seeing in gas production coming out of the wells, we expect there to be on the margin faster cadence for the need on gas pipe. So if someone else gets another gas pipe done "today," we think that's great for the basin, and we would be excited to see it happen.
Jeremy Tonet: And if I could just round that out a little bit more. In basin consumption growth, industrial demand growth or even maybe data centers down the road, do you see that, I guess, impacting the picture there?
Robert Muraro: This is Bobby again. I think we know there are a lot of people talking about it right now. We are in conversations with customers that are in conversations with all of those consumption points. So what gets built, when it gets built, what actually gets permitted and put under construction, I think it's yet to be seen. But there is a lot of action and a lot of conversation going on right now across the basin around those topics.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Michael Blum: I wanted to ask about the sort of the long-term trend here in growth CapEx. Obviously, you're trending higher here in the near term. I noticed you still have that same slide, which shows like a typical year at $1.7 billion. So is that still kind of normal year normalized run rate? Or is that number moving higher as producers, these numbers sort of exceed your expectations?
Jen Kneale: Michael, this is Jen. I think that when we put out that illustrative framework, we said that a good multiyear average for growth capital spending in a high single-digit Permian Basin growth environment would be about $1.7 billion. And we even caveated on the slide that if we were going to see growth substantially higher from there, we would expect CapEx to move higher as well. All very much core growth capital spending, the need for more gathering lines, more compression, potentially requiring the acceleration of major growth capital projects like plants and then downstream infrastructure. So the framework still holds for an environment where you're seeing high single-digit growth. As Matt said, so far, we've experienced 18% growth Permian this quarter relative to the third quarter of last year. For the 9 months of this year, we're up 14% relative to the 9 months of last year. So clearly, we are in a more robust environment, and that's resulting in us needing to accelerate some spending for that core infrastructure, additional gathering line compression, plant capital to make sure that we're in a position to handle the increasing growth for our producers. I think Pat also mentioned that we've enjoyed a lot of commercial success this year, and that's resulting in us needing to accelerate infrastructure spend on the G&P side for 2026, when we expect growth to continue to increase versus previous expectations when we provided that in February. So I think absolutely, it still holds together. It ultimately just depends what your view is of Permian growth. And, in particular, Permian growth on Targa's systems, where we are seeing more growth than others. And we very consistently have said that that's the case since we put out that framework in February.
Michael Blum: Okay. Makes sense. I then wanted to just ask about buybacks. Would you say that you're now more of an almost ratable type of buyback approach? Or is it still very much opportunistic and price-sensitive? And if it's the latter, how do you think about the pace of buybacks as the stock price just continues to move higher?
Jen Kneale: I would say that we are very much continuing to be opportunistic around share repurchases. And that's how we expect to continue to think about it going forward. Our priorities around capital allocation are unchanged. I think that what we've seen this year is a very strong 2024 is resulting in a lot more momentum when we think about '25, '26, '27, '28 and beyond that. We have a lot of conviction in what we have going on here at Targa for the short, medium and long term. And what you're seeing is us opportunistically execute around repurchases based on that conviction. And so I think you should continue to expect repurchases going forward, but they will continue to be opportunistic. We consider a number of different factors in terms of what our daily and quarterly activity looks like. So you should certainly expect some continued variability moving forward, but we do believe it's a very important tool for us to be able to use to return more capital to our shareholders as we move forward through time.
Operator: And the next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Keith Stanley: It seems like a pretty meaningful change in your volume outlook, even versus 3 months ago. I mean, you just updated the 2024 and '25 EBITDA and CapEx. So with that in mind, I wanted to just check back in on plans for NGL pipeline spending. Do you envision that potentially now being accelerated into 2025 at this point?
Scott Pryor: Keith -- oh, sorry.
Tristan Richardson: No, sorry, I'll just say -- Scott, go ahead.
Scott Pryor: Okay. Keith, this is Scott. So certainly, when we look at our transportation legs, we looked at the third quarter, we averaged to 784,000 -- excuse me, 829,000 barrels a day of transportation. We got a partial benefit of Daytona coming online in the third quarter. Obviously, in the fourth quarter, we'll have the full complement of our West leg of Grand Prix and then Daytona, and then that marries up with our 30-inch pipe that moves into Belvieu that gets contributions from the North Texas area as well as Oklahoma. So we've got some operating leverage today, certainly on the West leg when you think about those 2 24-inch pipes, and then we've got some operating leverage on the 30-inch pipe. The other thing that we've done in order to really take care of what our growing capacities are relative to what's going on the upstream side is we've entered into some third-party agreements that allows us the opportunity to really push out some capital benefit from the timing of when we would need to basically loop our 30-inch line. So those agreements, along with the operating leverage we have today, really gives us the benefit of time to evaluate what the volume rents look like over time. Those agreements that we've done really are in cadence. They ramp up in volume capacities that match up very well with kind of our near-term plant growth. But obviously, as we continue to add plants on the upstream side, eventually, we'll be in a position where we'll have to loop that 30-inch pipe. We will continue to evaluate that as we move into '25 with our budget process, and we're looking at CapEx. So I think we've got the benefit of time on our side right now with those agreements and the current leverage that we have.
Keith Stanley: The second question, the marketing was really strong in Q3. Would you attribute that more to spot LPG exports? Or is it optimization around weak Permian gas again? And on exports, it seems like you're constructive on pricing, but any sense of volumes you can share that might be able to take advantage of the strong ARPS?
Jen Kneale: Keith, this is Jen. I'll start. I'd say that it's been a strong year of marketing for us across all of NGL, natural gas and export marketing. We generally don't factor that into our guidance. So when you think about some of the factors that have contributed to our outperformance this year, certainly having a strong marketing year has been one of those variables. I think that as we think -- as we look forward, we expect that given the vastness of our footprint, we would be able to continue to identify strong marketing opportunities. But ultimately, it's really a combination of a lot of factors. And it's driven by the fact that we are moving so much volume across both our gas and NGL systems. That's really affording us some unique marketing opportunities as we move forward through time.
Scott Pryor: And Keith, this is Scott. Just as a follow-up to what we said earlier. The volumes in the third quarter were impacted a little bit due to our vessel inspection. But as we move into the fourth quarter, we would expect that to improve. Again, we benefited on the export side by being able to squeeze other cargoes in, again, the smaller size type vessels because we were playing a little bit of catch-up with the downtime that we had with the vessel inspection in the third quarter. So we'll see if the ARPS continue to be strong, and we'll look for opportunities to optimize around the system.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jean Salisbury with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Jean Salisbury: I believe that you've said before that most of your producer base has gas egress and hasn't been backed up the last 2 quarters, which I think has really showed in your volume results today. Does that mean that as Matterhorn ramps through the end of the year, you wouldn't really expect an outsized quarter-on-quarter step-up in volumes kind of over the next quarter or 2 as gas gets unlocked from the basin?
Matt Meloy: Yes, I'll start. We have not seen, I would say, across our producers, really Midland and Delaware, any negative volume impact from not having gas takeaway. We try and work with our customers to make sure that Targa's handling and moving those volumes on behalf of our producers. We have enough firm transport, intra and out of the basin to be able to move those volumes. And then producers on our system that have their own taking kind positions typically have enough transport to get those out. And so we work with them to make sure we can move those volumes. So I wouldn't say that will be a factor in kind of quarter-to-quarter growth. But as you look at just our volume growth across this year, in the last 2 quarters, we've been about 300 million a day, give or take, of volume growth in the second and third quarter. That's higher than normal. I don't know that I'd plug that in for -- plug in another 300 for Q4. I think we're going to have some growth, but it's likely not going to be in a straight line as you kind of move forward. I think we see strong growth going forward, but Q4 is likely to be a bit muted compared to the strength we saw in the second and third quarter.
Jen Kneale: Just to provide a little bit more visibility in the fourth quarter, we do also have a lower margin contract that's rolling over on the G&P side. So that will also reduce volumes quarter-over-quarter. So again, I think that speaks to us not being able to sustain the 300 million a day of growth that we've seen in the last couple of quarters, although we are still performing exceptionally well and are still seeing a lot of volumes come to us. That contractor all over will impact the fourth quarter.
Jean Salisbury: And then it seems like you should have the volume to fill your LPG expansion basically like immediately after it comes online next year. But there's obviously a lot of LPG export capacity coming online at the same time. Beyond that existing expansion, would you consider deploying the strategy that you've discussed of signing up for third-party LPG capacity kind of like what you do for pipelines to defer your own spend from here? Or do you see it as more strategic and value to have your own export capacity?
Matt Meloy: Yes. I think what we're trying to do the easy debottlenecks, which are really economic for us to just handle kind of the incremental volume growth we see across our footprint. But as this next one we have coming on mid next year, we are right now looking at kind of a larger step up in our LPG exports and bringing on capacity. Others are adding some as well. We're just seeing a lot of NGL volume growth and so are others. So I think it's all going to be needed. So we're currently evaluating right now, the timing and the size of our next LPG export expansion. It's likely going to include pipeline and additional refrigeration. Yes, both of those together is probably around $350 million or so for those 2 pieces. And so that's part of our planning process. And as we think about capital for '25 and '26, when we're going to need that, some of that capital end up in the back half of '25? Or is that a '26, '27, '28 kind of spending? That's what we're sorting through right now. But I do think it's needed. I don't see us in any real meaningful or term way contracting with others to bridge for us. I think we'll handle our own export across our docs on our own volumes.
Scott Pryor: Yes. And just to complement that a little bit, Jean, this is Scott. I would say that the primary pieces that Matt talked about on the -- excuse me, on the refrigeration side and on the pipeline side, as you said, kind of in that $350 million range. We -- and then before that. And even after that, we'll look for ways to kind of debottleneck even around that system by just an improved piping, both at our Belvieu facility as well as at our Galena Park facility. We're an aggregator of supply in Belvieu. So as our volumes start ramping up at that is coming off of our system, puts us in a position to prioritize that volume as opposed to volumes that we could aggregate in and around the Belvieu marketplace. So future expansions, we would look to take care of our volumes, but we would also put ourselves in a position to where we might have some capacity that we could optimize around that as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
John Mackay: You guys have had this sour gas footprint for a while now, but you spend a little more time talking about it on this call. So I'd just be curious to hear kind of how much of that pocket of the business could grow from here? What CapEx associated with that could look like? Because it's a little different than a typical kind of G&P build-out. And maybe just next milestones to watch there?
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure. We have been operating sour gas infrastructure kind of through Targa's history and even going back to the Dynegy days. So we have decades of experience of handling sour gas out there. We've seen the Delaware side continue to get more and more sour. So years ago, we really ramped up our spending to be able to handle more sour volumes out there. And that's really both H2S and CO2. So we mentioned in the call today, we have an 800 million a day treater coming online at our Bull Moose complex. We have additional wells being drilled in the permitting phase to continue to hand more and more volumes as the Delaware gets more and more sour over time. So we think that really does give us an advantage as we look out for growth over the short, medium and longer term. It's a little bit more tricky to handle the sour volumes. It's a little more difficult than just having handling sweet volumes. And so when it's harder, it gives us just better opportunity to work with our producers to handle those volumes. So we see that trend continuing. And I think that leads to some of our optimism about our longer-term growth rate out in the Delaware.
Robert Muraro: And this is Bobby. If you think about all the plants we've announced over the last several years on the eastern side of the Delaware Basin, even though we don't talk about it, all those plants are sour plans. So we don't talk about that. But if you think about Midway or if you think about Wildcat or if you think about [ Bolus ] or any of those plants, all those are sour plants. We just don't label in that way or we haven't historically as brightly as we do now just because that has obviously become front and center of one of the talking points in the industry.
John Mackay: Maybe just actually a quick follow-up to that then. You talked about getting some 45Q credits in this quarter. We're getting close -- you guys are getting closer to kind of a broader cash tax payment requirement over the next couple of years. Could the 45Qs get to a meaningful size where we're talking about some real offsets there? Or is this kind of nice to have, but a little more on the margin in the grand scheme?
Robert Muraro: This is Bobby. So I think when you talk about grand scheme, I think it's on the margin, but it is also a nice to have. So when you think about all of that -- all of those assets I just talked about on the eastern side of the Delaware Basin where we are putting in our infrastructure that gathers that sour gas, strips out the CO2 and H2S and injects it. We modified those systems a little bit and then we are able to get 45Q. So it is a very nice complement to that business and very efficient capital to spend in order to get that 45Q. So it turns into something that we don't have to do a whole lot more and be able to capture the 45Q. We continue to develop the CCUS business where it's not required to inject and that's in our forecast over time. But at the end of the day, when you talk about grand scheme of Targa, it is not huge relative to everything else we have going on.
Jen Kneale: And so just to finish that out, John, that means that from our perspective, it doesn't meaningfully change our outlook for cash taxes. As Bobby said, it's a nice to have, but there's really no change to our current expectation that will be subject to the ATM in 2026 and then a full cash taxpayer in 2027 when we've worked our way through our NOL. And that's all inclusive of our full business operations, including the opportunity set around CCUS.
Operator: And our next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS. Your line is open.
Manav Gupta: First of all, big congratulations to Tristan. Every time a sell-side analyst is able to do a jailbreak, it feels very nice for the rest of us. There is hope for us.
Tristan Richardson : Well, thank you for that.
Manav Gupta: My quick question, just one of them, is can you provide us more details around Falcon 2 or East Driver plants, why decision to move ahead with them? Anything you can give us on the economics or the build multiple?
Matt Meloy: Sure. I'd say the economics and build multiple is really the same that we've articulated previously. We've kind of pointed to around 5.5 times as our organic build multiple. I don't see these being materially different from that. So I think it just puts us in position to continue to invest either for our producers and execute on our core business, gathering and processing, and then moving the NGLs through our downstream infrastructure. And the timing of those, as I mentioned earlier, we're just seeing more volumes across both the Delaware and the Midland side of the Permian. And so that's led us to announce those kind of sooner than we were expecting. If you kind of go back to the beginning of the year, we were not anticipating announcing these plants right now and starting this work as soon as we are. But the volume upside has allowed us to accelerate these plants. And then we evaluate the timing of the next plants.
Robert Muraro: And this is Bobby. As Jen mentioned earlier in the call, Greenwood 2 coming up, highly utilized. At the end of the day, we keep trying to get a plant ahead. We keep trying to create space to be able to overhauls and maintenance and everything else. And this is a continued effort to try to get ahead so we can do all the things we need to do within our system and service our producers at the same time.
Operator: And our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist. Your line is open.
Neal Dingmann: Another nice quarter. Welcome, Tristan. My first question is just on your Permian Basin activity outlook. Specifically, I see on Slide 8, you mentioned your associated gas forecast that looks very favorable. I'm just wondering, I'd love to hear sort of what type of rig activity do you are and maybe not the oil price you're assuming around that associated gas forecast?
Patrick McDonie: Yes. This is Pat. When you look across the Permian right now, one out of every three rigs is running on Targa acreage. So activity level on our acreage footprint is very robust. And obviously, that acreage position that we have tied up is pretty significant. Matt alluded to it earlier on one of the other questions is -- it's producer-specific, right? We are seeing a lot of activity from different sized producers and new formations being explored and developed, some of those very gassy, which leads to gas growth across both Midland and Delaware sides of the basin. Unfortunately, we've had commercial success, additional new commercial success to tie up those plays. So it's the historical stuff we've always seen with the large acreage dedications and the activity and the commitment of very high-grade producers. And then some new stuff that's getting developed that we've been successful in. So when we look across the next 5 years, especially in the next 24 to 36 months, we see a lot of gas growth on our systems and a lot of activity on our systems.
Neal Dingmann: Yes, that makes a little sense. And then my second question, just on your future capital spend. Specifically, just wondering, would you all suggest there's any possible or potential incredible assets out there that could delay your meaningful 2025 free cash inflection? Or does that novel upside or upcoming inflection appear to be relatively certain?
Matt Meloy: I think when you just look at just our overall EBITDA growth we're going to have in '25 and with -- haven't given a firm number for capital yet for '25, but I think we're comfortable saying we're going to have a significant amount of free cash flow in 2025. Where exactly that shakes out is kind of what we're working through in our planning process, as we've talked about. Delaying or deferring that, I guess you're implying kind of M&A. We continue to look at assets, bolt-ons in and around our systems. We've continued to look really since the loose of acquisition at assets. But I think just for us, the bar continues to be very high for us. So we'll continue to evaluate. If there's something we can tuck in that looks really nice and has good value for Targa shareholders, we'll look at it. it's just the bar is going to be pretty high. We have a lot of growth on our G&P footprint and our downstream footprint. Our first priority is to make sure we execute on what we have organically in front of us. That's just going to continue to be our priority.
Neal Dingmann: Yes. The growth is notable.
Operator: And our next question comes from A.J. O'Donnell with TPH. Your line is open.
A.J. O'Donnell: Just one for me, and I kind of just wanted to go on a clarifying question to something that Jean brought up. Looking at Q4 volumes and our potential for volume growth and now that Matterhorn is in line. I'm curious if you guys have seen a jump in production from your customers with the new pipe being online? Or if some of the flows that we're seeing online or with that pipe right now is just gas moving around the basin?
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure. No, from our customers, we -- I would say I have heard of some customers that were not producing because they didn't have -- they either didn't like the Waha price or didn't have takeaway. But customers on our system, they were flowing and producing. So I think basin-wide, perhaps there is some of that. But for our customers, for -- I think the most part, they were producing and had takeaway.
A.J. O'Donnell: Absolutely. Yes.
Matt Meloy: So I think what's happening now is volumes kind of coming off, others moving on Matterhorn and it's just trying to find its way out of the basin. But with Matterhorn up and other pipelines online, there should be sufficient capacity at least for a while to handle those volumes. What you're seeing now is some maintenance on some pipes and some other disruptions on existing pipes, which is why our Waha has been kind of flat to negative here recently.
Operator: And our next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global. Your line is open.
Sunil Sibal: So I wanted to start off on the NGL pipeline segment. Seems like ethane prices have been weak lately. So I was curious what kind of ethane recovery trends you are seeing on your systems? And then the Daytona kind of contributing partly for the third quarter, how should we think about volumes on the Daytona system, especially any switchovers from third-party processing plants also?
Scott Pryor: This is Scott. First off, Daytona coming online gives us the ability to obviously flow on both our Grand Prix West system as well as Daytona. So it gives us some operating efficiency around just being able to split volumes between those 2 pipes and gives us a lot of operating leverage, as I said earlier, moving into our 30-inch pipe. When it comes to ethane, certainly, ethane prices sitting around $0.18. There may be some outlying areas that would be looking at rejection type economics. But when you look at the Waha area where gas prices are, I think pretty much most of the industry is in full recovery wherever they can, predominantly in the Permian Basin. And for us, we stay pretty much in recovery mode all the time just so that we can feed our system on all of our integrated platform. So again, I think some of the outlying areas outside of the Permian will probably be in rejection mode just based upon where prices are. But for us, it's pretty much full tilt for us.
Sunil Sibal: And then in the Badlands system, it seems like you had a pretty sizable uptick on the crude volumes. I was curious, is that something we can expect to continue or any onetime items there?
Patrick McDonie: Yes. This is Pat. We had an uptick in our activity level. We had some producers that have been waiting on permits and another producer, frankly, that hasn't been real active over the past let's say, 3 or 4 years that, one, the activity level from that producer upticked. And secondly, the permits were granted and the wells were drilled. So we got a really nice uptick in our crude oil volumes. And our base level continues. So we expect good activity. I wouldn't say continued robust growth, but good activity level going forward on the system.
Operator: I show no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tristan Richardson for closing remarks.
Tristan Richardson: Great. Thanks, Michelle. Thank you to everyone for joining the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-01 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Targa Resources Corporation Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Webcast and Presentation. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Sanjay Lad, Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. The floor is yours, sir.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks, Shari. Good morning, and welcome to the second quarter 2024 earnings call for Targa Resources Corp. The second quarter earnings release, along with the second quarter earnings supplement presentation for Targa that accompanying our call are available on our website at targaresources.com in the Investors section. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. Statements made during this call that might include Targa's or expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ please refer to our latest SEC filings. Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer ; and Jen Kneale, President, Finance and Administration. Additionally, the following senior management team members will be available for Q&A: Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer; and Will Byers, Chief Financial Officer. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning to everyone. We had another record quarter across multiple fronts. But before we get into all the good things happening here at Targa, I would like to first recognize all our employees impacted by Hurricane Beryl. We prepared for the storm, weathered the storm and performed across a difficult period to safely keep volumes flowing, providing best-in-class service when many of our employees were also managing without power and had damage to their homes. The hard work and dedication demonstrated during the storm is really something to be proud of. So I'd like to say thank you to the Targa team for all the extra effort. The storms reduced our volumes for only a short period, so we expect the impact on the third quarter to be minimal as there was no material damage to any of our assets. I would also like to welcome Will Byers, Targa's new Chief Financial Officer to our call this morning. Will officially joined us on July 22, and we're excited to have him as part of the Targa team. We'll add a lot of depth to our organization, given his 20-plus years of midstream finance experience, including serving in CFO roles over the last 10 years. As part of Jen's continued development, she has now transitioned into the role of President, Finance and Administration and will continue to increase her role and responsibilities. Turning now to our second quarter results, it was another strong quarter of performance across our organization, which sets us up well for the balance of this year and beyond. Record volumes in the Permian drove record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes downstream and record quarterly adjusted EBITDA. We brought our Train 9 fractionator in Mont Belvieu and our Roadrunner II plant in Permian Delaware online, on time, on budget. And given increasing volumes across our systems, they were both very much needed. We also executed on a quarterly record $355 million of common share repurchases which is reflective of our performance and strong conviction and the outlook for our business going forward. We also just announced our participation in a joint venture supporting the next natural gas pipeline from the Permian Basin. We provided a meaningful volume commitment to support the project, and this provides for a 17.5% ownership interest in the Blackcomb pipeline. Blackcomb will be a 42-inch pipeline transporting gas from the Permian to South Texas. The pipeline is expected to be project financed, so Targa's capital investment should be less than $200 million. Now let's talk a little more about our Permian position and the good things happening there. Activity in the Permian remains very strong, supporting our view of continued long-term growth from the basin. Our Permian volumes during the second quarter increased about 275 million cubic feet per day over the first quarter, which is a full plant. And year-over-year, our volumes in the Permian are up more than 600 million cubic feet per day. And currently, our volumes in the Permian are up another 200 million cubic feet per day compared to the second quarter. We expected strong growth from our Permian assets, but the growth we have seen this year has exceeded our expectations. We now expect low double-digit percentage volume growth this year, which sets us up well for meaningful growth in 2025 and beyond. This higher growth rate is driving incremental EBITDA and requiring additional growth capital investment. These volumes are core to our business, and we benefit across the integrated NGL value chain, driving higher margins into our downstream business and generating strong ROIC. Given higher-than-anticipated Permian volumes and an outlook for continued strong activity across our Midland and Delaware footprint, we announced our next two plants in the Permian, one in the Midland Basin and another in the Delaware Basin. Some spending for these plans was included in the forecast we provided back in February, but the timing and cadence of spending has accelerated. To support our higher volume and higher EBITDA profile, we are updating our estimate for growth capital spending for 2024, so approximately $2.7 billion. This increase or the increase in growth capital spend from our previously provided range is attributable to the acceleration of timing of plants in the Permian, incremental field capital compression and gathering lines the acceleration of downstream infrastructure connections and other opportunities like spending on enhancing residue gas takeaway. Similarly, we expect stronger than previously estimated Permian volume growth next year and are updating our 2025 estimate for capital spending to $1.7 billion, driven by a similar acceleration of plant and field capital and our investment in Blackcomb. We included a bridge on Slide 5 in our Q2 earnings supplement presentation for our updated estimates for 2024 and 2025 growth capital. The strength of our first half 2024 performance and continued strong outlook going forward driven largely by higher Permian volumes and higher volumes through our integrated system means the updated midpoint estimate. For our full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA is $4 billion, which is a $200 million or 5% increase from our previous estimate. We now expect higher adjusted EBITDA in 2025 and a similar free cash flow estimate to when we compare our outlook -- to when we provided our outlook in February, with 2025 representing an important inflection for our company as our meaningful free cash flow generation positions us to continue to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders, while further strengthening our investment-grade balance sheet. We believe that we are uniquely positioned for the short, medium and long term as an already strong outlook for Permian Basin volume growth from best-in-class producers continues to get stronger, which benefits our entire integrated value chain. Our contract structures support us continuing to invest on behalf of our producers, benefiting from cash flow stability and lower commodity price environments and upside as prices rise. And we are delivering record financial performance despite a weak commodity price backdrop. Before I turn the call over to Jen to discuss our second quarter results in more detail, I'd like to extend a thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution, while continuing to provide best-in-class service and reliability to our customers.
Jen Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was a record $984 million, a 2% increase over the first quarter. For the second quarter, our natural gas inlet volumes in the Permian averaged a record 5.7 billion cubic feet per day. Our NGL pipeline transportation volumes averaged a record 784,000 barrels per day. Our fractionation volumes averaged a record 902,000 barrels per day at our Mont Belvieu complex, and our LPG export loadings averaged 12 million barrels per month. Let's talk about our operational results in more detail. Starting in the Permian, our reported second quarter inlet volumes increased 5% when compared to the first quarter. In Permian Midland, our system is running near capacity, and our new Greenwood II plant is expected to be highly utilized when it comes online in the fourth quarter of 2024. Our next Midland plant, Pembrook II, will be much needed and remains on track to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2025. As Matt mentioned, today, we announced that we are moving forward with our latest Midland plant, East Pembrook which is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of 2026. In Permian Delaware, activity and volumes across our footprint are also strong. Our Roadrunner II plant commenced operations in late May and was fully utilized after startup. We are accelerating the timing of our next Delaware plant, [indiscernible], which is now expected to come online in the first quarter of 2025 and is also expected to come online highly utilized [ph]. Today, we announced that we are moving forward with our latest Delaware plant, Bull Moose II, which is expected to begin operations in the first quarter of 2026. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. Construction on our Daytona NGL pipeline expansion has been going well, and we believe that we may be able to bring the pipeline fully online earlier than estimated. Our Train 9 fractionator in Mont Belvieu came online full in May, and we are currently starting operations at our Gulf Coast fractionator joint venture, and we expect our portion of the capacity to be highly utilized at start-up. Construction on our Train 10 and Train 11 fractionators in Mont Belvieu continues, and our fracs are expected to be much needed when they come online, given our outlook for increasing Permian volume growth and resulting NGL volume growth to Mont Belvieu. Train 10 is now expected to begin operations late in the fourth quarter of this year and Train 11 is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of 2026. In our LPG export business at Galena Park, our second quarter volumes were impacted by a required 10-year inspection that reduced our loading capability in the second half of June through late July. We continue to benefit from nighttime transits and fully expect that to be a permanent benefit going forward. We remain on track to complete our expansion, which will increase our loading capacity and incremental 650,000 barrels per month in the second half of 2025. The strength of our performance in the second quarter with the backdrop of negative Waha gas prices and low NGL prices demonstrates that by investing in opportunities backed by fee-based and fee floor contracts, we are able to successfully invest across cycles to continue to support the infrastructure needs of our customers. We have largely removed exposure to downside commodity prices from our enterprise-wide risk profile, and given the strength of our outlook, also recently added hedges to further increase our cash flow stability. As described previously, 90% of our margin is fee-based or supported by fee floor contracts. The remaining 10% is exposed to commodity prices. Of that remaining 10% of exposure, we have now hedged approximately 90% of volumes across commodities through 2026. As commodity prices move higher, we will benefit from that upside through our fee floor contracts. Turning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had $1.6 billion of available liquidity, and our consolidated net leverage ratio was 3.6 times, well within our long-term leverage ratio target range of three to four times. During the second quarter, we repaid the $500 million balance on our term loan and the term loan is no longer outstanding. Shifting to capital allocation. Our priorities remain the same, which are to maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet to continue to invest in high-returning integrated projects and to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles, and we are delivering on those priorities. Our outperformance is leading to deleveraging faster than we previously forecasted, creating incremental capacity to enhance our return of capital. Supported by the strength of our business outlook, we repurchased a record $355 million of common shares in the second quarter at a weighted average price of $118.91. This week, our Board of Directors also authorized a new $1 billion common share repurchase authorization, and we continue to expect to be in a position to return capital to our shareholders through opportunistic repurchases. We are continuing to model the ability over time to return 40% to 50% of adjusted cash flow from operations to equity holders and believe that is a useful framework for thinking about Targa's return of capital proposition. Our talented Targa team continues to execute on our strategic priorities across the organization and safely operate our assets to deliver the energy that enhances our everyday lives. And I would like to echo Matt, thank you to all of our employees. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks, Jen. For the Q&A session, we kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up and reenter the lineup if you have additional questions. Sheri, would you please open the line for Q&A?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.
Matt Meloy: Hey, good morning.
Pat McDonie: Good morning.
Jen Kneale: Good morning.
Jeremy Tonet: I just wanted to touch on the guidance raise here a little bit. Especially the free cash flow inflection and just wanted to understand that a little bit better, whether that is absolute dollars or rate of change or just any other, I guess, way you could bracket what that means?
Matt Meloy: Yes. Hey, Jeremy. Yes, we raised our guidance for this year. It's really underpinned by the strength and the volume that we've seen, not only so far this year, but also just our expectations for the back half of the year and then leading into 2025. Producers just really continue to have high levels of activity across our system, and we received numerous, I think, kind of revisions to the short, medium-term outlook from our producers across our system. So, that let us feel really good about the EBITDA this year, and positioned us well going into 2025 and strong activity in 2025. So, when you look at our overall EBITDA growth that we expect, coupled with the CapEx moving from $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion, we see a similar -- really similar dollar amount of free cash flow to what we saw when we gave kind of the original outlook back in February of this year.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then looking across, it seems like the implied GPM across the processing fleet stepped up quite nicely in 2Q. Just wondering how much of that was tied to better ethane extraction economics in the quarter? How sustainable is the volume uplift in downstream? Just trying to understand that better, particularly, I guess, with Daytona tracking well, it seems?
Matt Meloy: Yes, I don't think we've seen anything really fundamentally different from the production side. We had higher recoveries in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. Is what drove the higher recovery GPM. I think the underlying volumes are similar. Pat?
Pat McDonie: No, they are. I mean we had some periods of ethane rejection in the first quarter. That, coupled with some weather issues at times, and we've been in full recovery during the second quarter.
Jenn Kneale: Very tight gas market in the Permian in the second quarter. And so that's another reason that you saw our recoveries improve.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. And just the last part with Daytona, if that's tracking early, any impact there, I guess?
Scott Pryor: Yes, Jeremy, this is Scott. The construction on Daytona has gone very well. When you enter into construction of a long-haul pipeline of this size and at this distance, you would anticipate once you get in the construction phase that you might have delays relative to weather or just in general construction delays. But for us, quarter in and quarter out, we've seen improvements. The Targa team has done an excellent job installing that pipe. And I would not be surprised if it actually comes online sometime during this quarter, the third quarter of this year. So, very pleased with the timeline.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. I'll leave it there. thanks.
Matt Meloy: Okay, thanks Jeremy.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question and that will come from the line of Spiro Dounis with Citi. Your line is open.
Spiro Dounis: Thanks, operator. Good morning everybody. First part is just a two-part question on volume growth. I think as we headed into the year, the messaging for you all was that maybe Targa start to sort of reflect basin growth kind of more broadly, but it seems like you're sort of back in that mode or you're growing at an accelerated pace. Maybe one, can you just touch on the dynamics there? What's going on in your system that's driving that accelerated growth versus the base on average? How long does that last? And then as we think beyond the near term, maybe just thinking around cadence between the next frac and maybe even pipeline expansion in Europe, this keeps up?
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure. I'll start, and then Pat, you can hop in. I mean, we've over the last several years, have really outperformed the basin. Our team has done a really good job at servicing our existing customers, but also having commercial success really across the Delaware and the Midland. We also have our assets, well, we have a wide -- kind of a wide area that we cover. We are in the best spots of the Midland, and we're in the best spots and most active spots in the Delaware as well. So, I think we benefit from that. We've seen this year continued strong activity from producers, but we've also seen revisions from our producers of the forecast they've given us. And the level of volumes that they're expecting to come across our system for 2024 and 2025. I'd say this year, we've seen more positive revisions than we have in other years. So, we've just benefited more from that. Maybe just goes to Targa's overall positioning and strong user activity. You have anything to add to that?
Pat McDonie: I think the key components there, Matt, are exactly what you said. Large footprint, fungible system underpinned by millions of acres of dedication on both the Delaware and Midland side of the basin, and that's with producers that are committed to growing the Permian Basin production outlook. So, when I look at the Midland system, it's pretty easy, right? We've been there for a long time. We've had that system. It is on the core, the core of the best rock in the basin. And then with the Lucid acquisition we did a couple of years ago now, that allowed us to get that same type of position in the Delaware Basin, where we are in the core of the core, covering the best rock, a great group of producers, again, underpinned by multimillion acre dedications with producers, again, that are committed to developing and growing their production in the Permian. And I think the one thing we left out in all of that is, we continue to have commercial success. We've had a lot of commercial success early in the Midland Basin and recently in the Delaware Basin that is additive to that footprint that we've already had in place for a good period of time.
Spiro Dounis: Got it. And as you think about the cadence for that next frac pipeline expansion, is that still kind of far enough out? Or does that seem like that's accelerating too?
Scott Pryor: Spiro, this is Scott again. I'll first start on the pipeline side of things. Certainly, with Daytona coming online, likely during this quarter, that gives us a lot of operational leverage as it relates to the volumes coming out of the west from the Permian along those 2 lines. So we've got the Grand Prix line, the original West line, we've got Daytona and with a lot of operational leverage with that. Then that ties into our trunk line that feeds into Mont Belvieu, where we've got some operational leverage as well. So we feel really good about where we are positioned there. I will say that with the cadence of the plants that Pat and his team have been successful at executing on and we look at the volume growth that we have. We've actually done some third-party contracts out there given the number of announcements you've seen on Y-grade pipeline coming out of the Permian, we feel as though there's a little bit of overcapacity, and we're in a position to at reasonable prices to do a term contract with the volume growth that we see on that. The likelihood is, again, with additional capacity that's out there, we'll look for some additional contracts that we can do. Again, as long as the prices are reasonable, it will allow us to push out the next expansion that we might have to have on our pipeline system and defer capital further out. So that puts us in a good position. As we look at frac side, certainly, we benefited in the second quarter of this year with Train 9 coming online during the month of May. We had some strong volumes across our fractionation footprint. We saw a little bit of impact in the first quarter because of some maintenance that we had scheduled. But the second quarter ran very well. Train 9 came online, basically full from day 1. And then when we look out into the third quarter, we'll have GCF coming online. Our equity share of that will likely be full. And then later this year, Train 10 will come online. Not much benefit we expect at this point from Train 10, but it is nice to see that we have moved the time line of that in-service date from the first quarter of 2025 to the latter part of this year and we'll see that come online and give us benefit. When you think about the timing of the plants from our G&P footprint, all the announcement that we had previously made as well as the ones this morning. A mid 2026 time frame for Train 11 fits us very well in order to catch those volumes as well. So, great position on the transportation side, both leveraging our current capacity as well as overcapacity, if you will, from a midstream perspective, as well as how we set on the fractionation front.
Spiro Dounis: Great. That's helpful color. One just quick follow-up on Blackcomb. So pretty small capital investment out of the gate. But I know in the past, you've never really looked at residue gas pipeline as kind of core to your portfolio. So curious, at some point, this become a monetization candidate or too early for now?
Matt Meloy : Yes. We just announced it this morning. So, I think, we will always look to do what's in the best interest of the shareholders, whether it's holding a minority interest or monetizing it. But I'd just say we're really excited to partner with white water and the other partners on this. It's much needed for the industry, much needed for the basin. And so we were excited to put a commitment on there and push this past FID and get going on this.
Spiro Dounis : Great. I’ll leave it there. Thanks for the color everyone.
Matt Meloy : Okay. Thank you.
Jen Kneale: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is open.
Theresa Chen: Good morning. On the underlying growth across your system, Matt, to your comment about low double-digit net volume growth in 2024. Can you just give us some more color on your view quantitatively for 2025 in led? And what are some of the puts and takes that underlie that view based on your discussions with your producer customers?
Matt Meloy : Yes. I'd say for 2024, we feel strong we talked about low double-digit growth. We haven't given an exact number where we see 2025. We continue to get updated producer forecast. We've had some commercial success here recently as well. So, as we go into the fall, we'll put all that together and say what does that look like for 2025. I think, what you're hearing from us today is it's trending higher. I think, we feel better about it being stronger than our -- what our 2025 expectations would have been earlier this year. And so I think we feel good we're going to have strong growth in 2025. What exactly that looks like we'll continue to develop that and we'll likely provide that outlook for you sometime in February.
Theresa Chen: Understood. And was there anything in particular that drove lower quarter-over-quarter OpEx on a unit basis despite higher volumes in L&T?
Matt Meloy : In L&T, I think what we saw was you saw a lot of volume increase through our frac and through Grand Prix. So we were waiting eagerly for Train 9 to come on. And so you saw a really large increase. We're up a kind of diverse comparative period is over 100,000 barrels a day. So we saw the volume number increase significantly, yes.
Jen Kneale : Theresa, so we also generally hire ahead of assets coming online. So you would have seen an increase in OpEx prior to Train 9 coming online, as we essentially got ready for it. So then when we get the volume associated with the asset essentially being full. When it does come online, that may be one of the reasons that the unit margins improved in the second quarter.
Scott Pryor : And I would also say, Theresa, that I alluded to the fact that we had some maintenance issues during the first quarter. Those are behind us now. Again, the second quarter ran very, very well. And to Matt's point, we had over 110,000 barrels a day of incremental frac runoff during the second quarter.
Theresa Chen: Thank you.
Matt Meloy : Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Michael Blum : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Wondering if there are any details on Blackcomb, you could provide like percent contracted with the return profile might look like? And would you expect there to be some project level financing for the project?
Bobby Muraro : Yeah, Michael, this is Bobby. I think we disclosed what we're going to disclose in the press release last night and then our earnings this morning. But when we think about getting gas takeaway out of the basin, we're excited to get this done, and bring in Targa's volumes to the table, it got it across the line to go FID obviously, last night and get supply for takeaway in -- out of the Permian for 2026 done and launched. I think we'll defer to white water on how much they share overtime. But I think at FID returns and the returns it fills up, I think it's going to be a great deal for Targa and all the partners that are investing in it.
Michael Blum: Okay. Understood. And then, I wanted to ask about capital spending really beyond 2025, so call it, 2026 and beyond. You have that slide in prior presentations that shows a typical run rate CapEx year at growth CapEx here at $1.7 billion. So I'm just wondering, given the acceleration here you've seen in volumes. Is that still the right way to look at the long-term cadence for growth CapEx?
Jen Kneale: We believe it is, Michael. The $1.7 billion multiyear outlook that we put out earlier this year is really predicated on a high single-digit Permian growth scenario. So as we said this morning, to the extent that we see an acceleration of volume growth beyond that in 2026 and beyond, that could change that growth profile. And then the other element that we've pointed to since we put that slide out is that, our downstream capital spending is lumpier generally than our discrete projects on the gathering and processing side to the extent that we need to add fractionation or in particular, transportation, that can change the complexion of how that outlook plays out for a given individual year. But I think over a multiyear horizon, it still very much holds again, largely dependent on what the assumption is for underlying Permian growth volumes.
Michael Blum: Got it. Thank you.
Jen Kneale: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
John Mackay: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time and congrats to Jen and Will. …
Jen Kneale: Thank you.
John Mackay: I wanted to go back to something we've asked about a couple of times here, but maybe just about a finer point on it. When we're seeing this Permian growth expectations continue to move up. I guess, I'd just be curious, if you could piece a little more out of that. Is it hey, these customers are actually expecting to bring in more rigs and crews back half of the year? Is it, hey, actually, productivity gains are a lot higher than we've expected? Is it all in the GOR side? Anything there you can kind of break out for us would be helpful.
Pat McDonie: Yeah. What I would say is no, we're not expecting an increase in rigs. What we're seeing is greater efficiencies. And with some of the recent combinations of companies that you've seen more efficient use of combined acreage position. So they are getting higher productivity. They are able to drill an equivalent number of wells with a lower rig count. GOR is certainly a factor, but in the big scheme of things, it's not as big a factor. Obviously, we've seen it increase and continue to increase, but the continuing increase is a lot lower than what it was over the past, say, three to five years. So it's really activity of the producer group that is on the Targa acreage, their commitment to drilling in the Permian, and they're achieved frankly, they're achieved efficiencies. And again, it goes back to our commercial success, adding to the footprint we already have.
John Mackay: Yeah. That's really clear. I appreciate that. Maybe just shifting to return of capital, buyback number was great. I guess I'd just be curious to your guys' latest thoughts on the buyback versus the dividend, given the recent run in the stock?
Jen Kneale: I'd say that there's really no change to how we are thinking about capital allocation, John. Foundational to everything that we're doing is a strong balance sheet. And as we've articulated this morning, we see our balance sheet getting stronger through the end of this year and into next year, and that's creating a lot of flexibility for us. We were very active in the second quarter. We have an opportunistic share repurchase program. You'll continue to see us be opportunistic, which will create some variability quarter-to-quarter. But the underlying premise is that we believe that our outlook is only strengthening over the short, medium and long term. And we have a lot of conviction in where the company is today and where the company is headed. And part of how we will continue to return capital to shareholders is really through both a combination of likely meaningful increases in our annual dividend per share as well as continued opportunistic share repurchases.
John Mackay: Thanks for the time.
Matt Meloy: Okay, thanks. John.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Manav Gupta with UBS. Your line is open.
Manav Gupta: Hi, guys. A quick question. I think a few quarters back, you had indicated that some of the growth projects you have could deliver incremental EBITDA of $300 million or so. How has that guidance changed as some of the new projects are coming in? And how should we think about these incremental growth projects delivering EBITDA of over 2025 and 2026?
Matt Meloy: Sure, yes. Yes, we indicated kind of our investment multiple going forward about 5.5 times, call it, five to six times EBITDA. And I think you've seen our track record over the last several years. EBITDA multiple has even been perhaps a little bit stronger than that. We're investing in the same kind of projects that have delivered return -- strong returns for us over the last several years. It's investing in our gathering and processing business and then expanding our downstream NGL infrastructure to accommodate those volumes. So we're really sticking to our core business. We expect the returns to be very good. That 5.5 is kind of what we indicated would be a pretty good base case, what we think we can do. I hope we can beat that. But if we do 5.5, it will be a really good return profile for us.
Manav Gupta: Thank you. I'll turn it over.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Keith Stanley: Hi, good morning. First, I wanted to start with a follow-up just on 2025 CapEx. Are you baking in any NGL pipeline spend in there or you're comfortable third-party contracts are giving you enough visibility that you don't need to invest in more pipeline capacity yet next year?
Matt Meloy: Yes, hey, Keith, you are correct, yes. For 2025, with Daytona coming on, back half of this year, we should have sufficient transport through 2025 and some period beyond Daytona coupled with the third-party transportation that we've already executed, and we're working on more. So we're really talking about when and if we may need to do another NGF wide and how it impacts 2026, 2027, 2028 capital. But for 2025, our expectation is we don't have any meaningful transportation capital in that number.
Keith Stanley: Great. Thanks. Second question, with volumes coming in a lot higher than expected, is it fair to think you're offloading a lot more to third parties this year than normal? And then we think about growth into 2025 and new assets coming online, should we expect some additional financial tailwinds just from bringing volumes back onto your system in '25 that maybe you're offloading this year?
Matt Meloy: Yes. No, good question.
Pat McDonie: We'll looking around who's going to answer this.
Matt Meloy: Everyone's raising your hand. So I'll start. And then when we think about offload, it really is dependent on the piece of the business. Is it gathering and processing, transportation, frac. I'd say as our volumes have really exceeded our expectations, there are periods of times where we do offload on the G&P side. But with the flexibility we have with our plants, mostly we handle that amongst ourselves, and we'll actually handle some offloads from third parties on the G&P side. As you look through the downstream, the transportation and frac of our NGL volumes have grown significantly, we have connectivity to basically every other pipe in the Permian going to Belvieu. So we have those existing connections from our plants, from legacy plants, from acquired plants. So we have a lot of flexibility to move volume. So look to optimize that for what's the cheapest cost transport while we're bringing Daytona. So there are some volumes that we're moving on other pipes that we'll be able to go on Daytona kind of day one as soon as that comes up. And then same on the fractionation side, we have Train 9, GCF and Train 10, all coming online this year. If you kind of look back at our volumes, the frac has not grown as much as some of our other volumes, and that's because we're managing third-party fractionation there as well. So you saw a big step up this quarter with Train 9 coming on that is kind of bringing some of those volumes back onto our system. I'd expect more of that to happen in the third quarter and the fourth quarter.
Keith Stanley: Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global. Your line is open.
Sunil Sibal: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everybody. And first of all, congratulations to Jen and Will for their new roles. So I wanted to start off -- so I wanted to start off on your CapEx program. So could you remind us what's the current best estimate on building a new 275 plant and filling it up?
Matt Meloy: I would say, on average, our plants are around $200 million on the G&P side of things for a new 275 plan. Some have been a little bit cheaper, some have been a little bit more depending on what kind of inlet compression you're doing in, some of the other bells and whistles or sweet sour, but it's around 200 for the plants we have announced.
Sunil Sibal: And then similar amount to fill it up in terms of gathering systems, et cetera?
Matt Meloy: How much field capital? Well, that's also one where it varies from year to year, how much pipeline compression you're going to need? Is it more high pressure, is it more low pressure. So you can see more variability on that. So there are times we're also ordering more compression. We're trying to build some inventory because we see strong growth in the next year. So that has moved around quite a bit, I don't know. Pat, add any other color we want to give?
Pat McDonie: No, I think you described it. I mean there's a lot of variability there. It depends on if producers drill behind existing batteries. Where they drill, how many new batteries we're connecting, high-pressure low-pressure all those things, sweet sours. There's just a ton of it, and you're right. With lead times on compression and plants, that capital kind of gets get kind of mothball together and it's -- there's not a real finite number that I'd be comfortable.
Matt Meloy: And we haven't really seen, I'd say, a material change. It varies from year to year, but we haven't seen a trend of getting more expensive or less expensive. It's been operating within a band that we've seen year in, year out.
Sunil Sibal: Understood. And thanks for the bridge that you provided on the CapEx program. I just had one clarification on the other category. Seems like you're indicating carbon capture is also put in the other category. Could you indicate what kind of capital you spent so far on carbon capture and when can we expect to see returns on that?
Jen Kneale: We're not going to break it out separately, Sunil. What we have said is that we expect to be in a position to potentially benefit from 45Q credits later this year. We have a number of projects that we're commercializing in the Permian Basin that's very much core to what we do and what we are good at. So it's small enough that it doesn't make sense for us to break it out separately, but I'd say the returns are consoserate with what we're seeing across the rest of our investment opportunities across the portfolio.
Sunil Sibal: Okay. Thanks for that.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Jen Kneale: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, and that will come from the line of Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Q – Tristan Richardson: Hi, good morning, guys. Maybe just a quick one on Blackcomb. Is it wrong if equity stake has some correlation with the capacity you expect to have in the pipe? And then maybe just thinking about your capacity portfolio in general, with the growth you're seeing exiting 2024 and looking into 2025?
Bobby Muraro: This is Bobby. Yes, as we build our portfolio to transport, we obviously market a ton of gas for our producers across the Permian Basin. And as we look at the portfolio of takeaway, we've talked about it before in tight markets, we spend a lot of time to make sure that all the gas moves out of our plants. Some of that is long haul out of the basin, like our Blackcomb deal. And but I'd tell you, a majority of it is within basin and tailgate sales to people that have transport. So we manage that all together. And then as we think about making sure there is egress from the basin on pipes. That's when we step out on things like this Blackcomb deal to make sure that a pipe gets built, timely enough such that the basin doesn't have more material issues than it already has. So when I think about what we put on a pipe like Blackcomb, it is a very small subset of the amount of gas we market across the basin. So it's not a needle mover relative to the amount of gas we market but it is part of the science we go through every year thinking out one year, thinking out two years, thinking out three years and how we're going to make sure all the gas moves through our plant so that the NGLs get out and our producers can produce their oil.
Q – Tristan Richardson: Helpful, Bobby. And then Jen, obviously, you said 2Q was a very tight gas market. I mean, curious where fee floors a factor in 2Q or even said another way, Targa able to put up a very strong 2Q irrespective of where basis sits today versus when we see relief on the horizon, hopefully, by fourth quarter.
Jen Kneale: In the second quarter supports why the fee floors are so important to us. When you think about the amount of capital that we spent in the quarter, now moving forward with two additional gas processing plants to support our producers with the backdrop of negative Waha prices and low NGL prices, yes, you can assume that the fares -- the fee floors were very much important to us in the second quarter. And really have been in play for a substantial number of months over the last, call it, 1.5 years or so. And that again is really what's allowed us to invest through what is a low commodity price cycle right now and what is allowing us to continue to invest looking forward as well.
Q – Tristan Richardson: That’s great. Thank you, guys very much. Appreciate it.
Jen Kneale: Thanks, Tristan.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sanjay Lad for any closing remarks.

 I will now turn the call over to Matt. 
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning. We are proud of our first quarter results as we continue to execute across the organization to deliver another quarter of record adjusted EBITDA, Permian volumes and LPG export volumes, along with a 50% increase to our common dividend per share and $124 million of common share repurchases. For the quarter, we really benefited from strong back half of the quarter Permian volume growth. January was impacted by operational upsets associated with harsh weather. From there, volumes significantly increased throughout the quarter, which helped drive record results and sets us up well looking forward.
 We are adding a substantial amount of compression across the rest of the year and our expectation is for continued Permian volume growth, recognizing that prior to Matterhorn initiating service and adding incremental natural gas takeaway capacity, gas markets will remain tight. As we saw in March and April, there are upsets associated with pipeline maintenance that create further constraints, it may affect volumes and significantly impact Waha gas prices. Short-term constraints aside, given our outlook for increasing Permian volumes and resulting NGL supply growth, we announced this morning that we are moving forward with 2 major growth capital projects. Our next Permian Midland plant, Pembrook II and our next fractionator in Mont Belvieu, Train 11 to support the infrastructure needs of our customers.
 We mentioned in February that we are ordering long lead items for both projects and have since received Board approval to move forward with no change to our estimates for 2024 and 2025 net growth capital spend. I am pleased to announce that we are also moving forward with a small capital project at our Galena Park facility that will increase our LPG export capacity by approximately 650,000 barrels per month within the second half of 2025. This project is an excellent example of our organization balancing between capital efficient, while ensuring our ability to support increasing volumes through our systems and also does not change our estimates for growth capital spending.
 Despite the current weakness in Waha natural gas and NGL prices, we continue to estimate full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion, which we believe is reflective of the importance of our fees and fee floors in our G&P business, which are supporting our continued investment in infrastructure despite a lower commodity price environment. Looking ahead, our premier Permian supply aggregation position, coupled with our integrated NGL system, positions us nicely to continue to generate high return organic opportunities and be able to continue to return incremental capital to our shareholders.
 Let's now discuss our operations in more detail. Starting in the Permian, activity continues to remain strong across our dedicated acreage. In Permian Midland, construction continues on our new Greenwood II plant and remains on track to begin operations in the fourth quarter of this year. Greenwood II is expected to be highly utilized when it comes online which is necessitating moving forward with Pembrook II, which is expected to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2025.
 As you may have seen publicly, we had a fire at our Greenwood I plant in Permian Midland on April 16. There were no injuries, and we appreciate the work by our Targa team and first responders who were able to extinguish the fire safely and quickly. With 19 plants and a broad footprint across the Permian Midland, we are leveraging our operational flexibility to move gas around to handle all existing volumes and planned production growth to continue to be able to provide reliable service to our producer customers while the plant is down. We expect the plant back online before the end of the second quarter and do not expect the plant downtime to significantly impact our Midland volumes for the second quarter. We estimate about $10 million of repairs related to the incident.
 In Permian Delaware, activity in volumes across our footprint are also running strong. Our Roadrunner II plant is expected to commence operations in June and is also expected to begin service highly utilized. Our next Delaware plant, Bull Moose remains on track to come online in the second quarter of 2025. We continue to expect increasing Permian volumes as we move through the rest of the year as we benefit from new compression and plants coming online.
 For the second quarter, Waha gas prices are averaging around negative $1.30 as residue gas pipeline downtime for maintenance and operational upsets have resulted in additional tightness in the Permian Basin. We have done a good job of managing our Permian gas takeaway position to ensure surety of flow from our producers as the market awaits some relief when the Matterhorn pipeline comes on later this year.
 Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. Construction continues on our Daytona NGL pipeline expansion, and we remain on track to begin operations in the fourth quarter of this year. The outlook for NGL supply growth continuing means our Daytona expansion will be much needed to handle incremental barrels. We are currently starting up our new fractionator in Mont Belvieu, Train 9 and expect it to be highly utilized. We expect to restart our Gulf Coast fractionator joint venture during the second quarter, which we also expect [ our ] portion of the capacity to be highly utilized at start-up. Construction continues on our Train 10 fractionator, which is also expected to be much needed when it comes online.
 Given our outlook for increasing NGL production growth to Mont Belvieu supports us officially moving forward with Train 11, a new 150,000 barrel per day fractionator. Train 11 is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of 2026. And the capital associated with Train 11 was already included in our expectations for spending that we provided publicly for both 2024 and 2025. In our LPG export business at Galena Park, our loadings were a record 13.3 million barrels per month during the first quarter as we continue to benefit from strong market conditions and the Houston Ship Channel allowance of nighttime transits for larger vessels.
 Before I turn the call over to Jen to discuss our first quarter results in more detail, I would like to extend a thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution, while continuing to provide best-in-class service and reliability to our customers. Our employees continue to rise to the challenges of our business, and we are appreciative of their efforts. 
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was a record $966 million, a 1% increase over the fourth quarter. For the first quarter, our natural gas inlet volumes in the Permian averaged a record 5.4 billion cubic feet per day, a 2% increase when compared to the fourth quarter. Large Permian volumes were stronger than estimated when we hosted our February earnings call and significantly higher than January, which translated into additional volumes downstream. 
 For the full quarter, our NGL pipeline transportation volumes averaged 718,000 barrels per day. Our fractionation volumes averaged 797,000 barrels per day, including the impacts of scheduled maintenance at our Mont Belvieu complex. Our LPG export loadings were a record 13.3 million barrels per month, and we benefited from optimization opportunities in our marketing business. 
 As we look across the rest of 2024, second quarter EBITDA may be weaker than Q1, given seasonality in our business, the impacts on the quarter of the fire at our Greenwood plant and the tight Permian residue gas market, with EBITDA increasing through the back half of the year. The combination of our fee and fee floor contracts in our Gathering and Processing segment and our hedges mean we are largely insulated from current commodity prices that are significantly lower than our guidance prices. As Matt said, we continue to estimate full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion and expect to exit 2024 with a lot of momentum heading into 2025, given our new infrastructure that comes online this year.
 This morning, we included a new performance metric in our disclosures, adjusted cash flow from operations, which is adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and cash taxes. This is the metric that we first started discussing last November around our return of capital framework looking forward, and we thought it made sense for us to also include it in our disclosures. Including the new growth projects announced this morning, there is no change to our estimate for 2024 growth capital spending of between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion. 
 We also continue to estimate made approximately $1.4 billion of net growth capital expenditures in 2025, which will result in meaningful free cash flow generation. Our current year estimate for net maintenance capital spending remains $225 million. At quarter end, we had $2.6 billion of available liquidity, and our consolidated net leverage ratio was 3.6x, well within our long-term leverage ratio target range of 3 to 4x.
 Shifting to capital allocation. Our priorities remain the same, which are to maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet to continue to invest in high-returning integrated projects and to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles, and we are delivering on those priorities. We are continuing to model the ability over time to return 40% to 50% of adjusted cash flow from operations to equity holders and believe that this is a useful framework for thinking about Targa's return of capital proposition over time. 
 Consistent with previously announced expectations, our Board approved the declaration of a 50% increase to the 2024 annual common dividend to $3 per share and we expect to be able to grow the annual common dividend meaningfully thereafter. We also repurchased $124 million of common shares during the first quarter at a weighted average price of approximately $104 per share.
 We believe that we continue to offer a unique value proposition for our shareholders and potential shareholders; growing EBITDA, a growing common dividend per share, reducing share count and excellent short, medium and long-term outlooks. Our talented team continues to execute on our strategic priorities and safely operate our assets to deliver the energy that enhances our everyday lives. And we are so thankful for the efforts of all of our employees.
 And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay. 
Sanjay Lad: Thanks, Jen. For the Q&A session, we kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up and reenter the lineup, if you have additional questions. Jonathan, would you please open the line for Q&A? 
Operator: And our first question comes from the line of Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. 
Michael Blum: I want to start with the LPG volumes, it seems like still had really strong volumes in the quarter. It seems like the Panama canal issues while the global shipping volatility is not really impacting U.S. cargoes or your cargoes. So I wonder if you could just speak to what you're seeing in the global markets and then how you see the rest of the year shaping up. 
D. Pryor: Michael, this is Scott. Yes, we continue to have great success across the dock, obviously, in the fourth quarter of last year, and that continued through the first quarter of this year. To your point around shipping. Shipping has certainly moderated. It does not seem to be an issue today. We were able to take advantage of that in the fourth quarter, and again, in the first quarter of this year, with vessels being available so that our spot opportunities really persisted throughout the quarter, both on propane as well as on butane.
 Panama Canal issues don't seem to be really impacting it at all. I will say that overall shipping has kind of resolved itself to really going around the cape of good hope. As opposed to transiting through the Panama Canal though, there are still some LPG vessels that are going through. But again, it's not near to the level that you have seen historically, probably 2 to 3 vessels per week are transiting the Panama Canal on an LPG-type basis.
 For us, certainly, the spot opportunities were there during the first quarter, but we really benefited from a continuation of our expansion project that we had last -- third quarter of last year as well as the nighttime transits, which we continue to benefit from, and we would really see that continuing. Again, hats off to the Houston Ship Channel, the Houston Pilots Association, they have operated that -- those nighttime transits very safely and accommodating the industry as a whole and I really believe that, that will just continue for years to come.
 So, for the balance of the year, we'll just have to see how things shake out. I think the demand is really strong in the East, with new PDH plants coming online in China, though that will somewhat marginalize some of the older plants. But again, in the domestic market, demands that are happening in the third world countries that are developing their marketplaces, it really just looks good for us throughout the balance of this year. 
Michael Blum: Great. Maybe just a follow-up on this topic. The nighttime transits, is there -- can you quantify how much of that add for the quarter? Or just in general, how much you think that adds on sort of effective capacity basis? And would you say this is kind of a new normal? 
D. Pryor: I think we alluded to the fact that last quarter that we saw it probably in the range of, call it, 7% or something like that. I would actually suggest to you that we've actually seen better percentage benefit to us. It really just allows us to operate our refrigeration units at a higher utilization rate with those nighttime transits. So we're getting significantly above, say, a 10% type improvement over -- in our overall operating rates. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays. 
Theresa Chen: Maybe turning to the upstream side of things. Just given the strength of the inlet volumes in Q1, which arguably was higher than many expected, given the weather impact this year, and I appreciate the intra-quarter commentary, Matt. But how do you view the cadence growth for the remainder of 2024, taking into account the Waha egress issues? 
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure. I'll start. And then, Pat, if you want to add anything. Yes, we were, I'd say, pleasantly surprised with how volumes responded post the harsh weather in January. We're starting to see it in February, and then March was a very strong month. And that's really setting us up really well here in the second quarter. So I expect there to be continued growth in both Midland and Delaware, really from now throughout the end of the year, there's a lot of producer activity.
 So kind of barring any upsets, we have seen residue pipes go down from time to time, which can cause us to move gas around the system and can result in some lower volumes for a short period of time. It's hard to see -- it's hard to know exactly what impact that will have until Matterhorn comes on. I think we're still optimistic we're going to have continued growth from now through the end of the year, even despite those issues. 
Patrick McDonie: I would agree, Matt. Borrowing constraints on -- caused by residue issues, we have great line of sight with our producers, and the activity continues. We've got infrastructure going in place to handle it. So we're set up very well for that continued growth, and we expected throughout the year. 
Theresa Chen: Got it. And great to see the CapEx unchanged while taking into account the new projects as you previously telegraphed, with the backdrop of the free cash flow inflection next year as CapEx [ that's lowering ], returning more cash to shareholders, you hit a decent run rate. And I was wondering what is Targa's next area of strategic focus from here? 
Matt Meloy: Well, really, I think it's more of the same. I think it's -- our top priority, as Jen mentioned, is making sure, first, we have a strong balance sheet and good financial flexibility and then investing in our core business through organic growth. And I think we're going to continue to do that. We announced Train 11. We announced Pembrook II. We're looking at when we're going to need the next plan in the Delaware. We're already looking at when we'll need the next plan after Pembrook II. So it's really continued organic growth along, kind of, our -- along our core business, which is gathering and processing. And then moving those NGLs through our [ Grand Prix ], Daytona and our fractionation and export. So I think that's been our focus, and that's going to continue to be our focus. 
Jennifer Kneale: And Theresa, this is Jen. I would just add that I think that's part of why we're so excited about the short, medium and long-term outlooks for Targa. When we think about the millions of acres that are already dedicated to us in the Permian, where we've got a great set of producers that have been so successful with their drilling activity. It feels like we just have an excellent runway in front of us over that short, medium and long term to just continue to do what I think we've put up a very credible track record around doing successfully, really for as far as the eye can see. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Securities. 
Jeremy Tonet: Just wanted to see how you're thinking about taking stock of results so far, in the plant, seems like that's a minor issue there. Do you see yourselves within the guidance range that you reaffirmed? Do you see itself tracking towards the higher end or the lower end? Or how do you see, I guess, factors that could drive upside versus the downside at this point of the -- within the range? 
Jennifer Kneale: Jeremy, this is Jen. I'd say that it's early. It's April. But so far, our employees have done a really excellent job of executing on a really strong first quarter and April that has had its challenges. So we're just really pleased of the efforts of all of our employees to date. And I think that's setting us up really well for the rest of the year as well. We've talked a little bit about the fact that we certainly are assuming that volumes are going to continue to ramp in both the Delaware and the Midland Basin, and that's not without some potential constraints. So ultimately, it's early, and we'd like to see how the rest of the year shapes up, but we're clearly feeling really good about our performance to date and the outlook we have going forward. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of John MacKay from Goldman Sachs. 
John Mackay: Maybe let's pick that last one up again, if you don't mind, and I understand the kind of initial commentary on 2Q EBITDA, but I was wondering if you could just tie that with the message that Permian volumes should still be growing quarter-over-quarter, is it the $10 million of kind of expense from the plant outage? Is it marketing rolling off, seasonality? Maybe just kind of bridge that and kind of balance that against, again, the quarter-over-quarter Permian growth. 
Jennifer Kneale: John, this is Jen. I think you've got a lot of the pieces already, which is with the Greenwood fire, Matt quantified that we see about $10 million of additional expense. Some of that will be in capital in terms of the repairs that we need to make, but some of that will be in operating expenses as well. We'd also expect OpEx to rise Q2 relative to Q1 as we do have new assets coming into service. And we do have a lot of seasonality in our businesses that generally tend to result in weaker second quarters versus certainly the fourth or the first quarters of the year. So I think as we look at all of that, it's just playing some conservatism through our minds that we really just want to get through this quarter, continue to put up strong growth numbers in the Permian that will result in more volumes through the rest of our integrated system. We are very happy that Train 9 is starting up. That is very much needed at this point in time.
 Our capacity at GCF will be very much needed as well. So it also has to do with the fact that we've got some operational and really sort of facility constraints that have put a little bit of a limit on us that's coming off now here in the second quarter that again sets us up really well when we think about the third and fourth quarters and beyond. 
John Mackay: Appreciate that. And maybe if we just zoom out a little bit, taking into account the kind of some of these infrastructure issues we've seen in the first half and also the fact that most of the producers are talking about second half weighted activity levels for their Permian plans overall. Are we seeing any shifts in producer activity? Or does it feel like that second half ramp that we're expecting for the Permian more broadly, that's still in hand. 
Patrick McDonie: Well, I would say across our systems, we've seen pretty consistent growth. Frankly, the first half of this year is pretty robust. We put a lot of infrastructure in place today and have a lot more specifically compression. And obviously, Jen and Matt have talked about the plans we're bringing on compression to put in place. And that is solely focused on production that we know is getting drilled and being brought online. If I look at first half versus second half of the year, if across our system, sure, there's some incremental volume there, but it's really strong growth throughout the entire year for us. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis from Citi. 
Spiro Dounis: First question, maybe just to go to some of the projects announced this morning. You've got another plant, another frac and a small export expansion. As we think about 2025 CapEx, do you still have room to announce even more projects before the need to amend guidance and just with everything you announced today, do you even see the need to announce anything else to facilitate that growth into next year? 
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure. Yes. So the Pembrook II and Train 11 were both contemplated and in our base case multiyear plan. As we look forward, we're always assessing when we're going to need additional plants in the Gathering and Processing, especially out in the Permian. So we had other plants in there. So I'd say we're kind of tracking towards what we had expected when we initially came with that guidance. And I'd say, yes, we have some room to handle some incremental growth in our business, kind of through '25 as planned. And I already mentioned, we're already evaluating when we're going to need another Delaware plant. So we're looking into that. I wouldn't think those are going to have a material impact on our outlook for capital for 2025. 
D. Pryor: And Spiro, this is Scott. As it relates to the small expansion project that Matt mentioned in his script, that is a small capital dollars for us to expand the export capacity. It basically gives us another VLGC a month starting in, call it, the third quarter of 2025. And really just a complement to our operations and our engineering teams for continuing to find ways to debottleneck our current assets and giving us a runway not only with last year's expansion, nighttime transits, as we mentioned earlier in the call, but along with this expansion, it gives us a good runway likely through Train 11. 
Spiro Dounis: Understood. [indiscernible] color there. Switching gears a bit, maybe just to go back to capital return. Some meaningful step up quarter-over-quarter in the buyback despite some of the really strong stock performance. So I suspect you still see a lot of value of your stock here. So curious -- maybe just comment on thinking through the rest of the year. Maybe one we could see you start to track closer to that 40% to 50% payout target. 
Jennifer Kneale: Spiro, this is Jen. I think relative to repurchases, we clearly have very strong conviction in our outlook. Our flexible balance sheet is strong today, and it's only going to strengthen as we really move through 2024 and into 2025 and have a much lower growth capital spend next year. So I think that we're really looking at our repurchase program as continuing to be opportunistic and it's one of the tools that we will continue to use to be able to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. 
 You see some variability quarter-to-quarter and that's largely dependent on the opportunities that we're seeing in the market to repurchase shares as well as a whole lot of other things that are happening relative to when we're spending, what we're spending, what we have in terms of what's coming in on the margin side, there's just a lot that is factored into what we're doing every day related to our repurchase program.
 So I'm not going to give guidance on where we expecting to take this quarter-to-quarter, the rest of the year. But it is certainly a very important tool that we will continue to utilize to return capital to our shareholders. And I think we've been pretty open that when we laid out the framework of 40% to 50% of cash flow from operations and that really being what we are using internally as the guidepost for how we can return capital to shareholders over sort of a 5-year planning horizon. We said that 2024, we may not be in that ZIP code just because our growth capital lift this year is so big. But ultimately, we'll just have to see how the rest of the year shakes out. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Neil Dickman from Truth Securities. 
Jacob Nivasch: This is Jake Nivasch on for Neil. Two for me, and I know we touched on this a good amount, but I just want to ask it a different way. In terms of the, I guess, the upstream growth that we're talking about here, are you seeing it across all of your producers? Is it -- are there a select few key producers that are -- that you think are going to drive this growth? Just curious, I guess, what the dynamic or split looks like there. 
Patrick McDonie: What I would say is that it's pretty consistent across all our producers, I mean, certainly, some have more rigs running and they're a little more of a greater percentage increase than others. But activity level across our entire producer base is pretty robust. It's across the Delaware, the Central and the Midland Basin. It's not area specific. It's not producer specific. It's really strong, steady activity across the producer base, across the entirety of the Midland Basin. So right now, we feel really good about the way our producers are performing. And frankly, we're getting, like I said earlier, infrastructure in place to be ready to handle it. 
Robert Muraro: And this is Bobby. As we think about our expectations at the end of the day, so much of our gas is coming from low-pressure gathering. This is a step that's coordinated out months and a year at a time. So we have really good visibility for what we think comes online, when and where. 
Jacob Nivasch: Sure. And then just a follow-up here. With regards to capital spending, I guess, in 2025, I guess, how sticky is that growth CapEx number that you guys are looking at that $1.4 billion? And the reason I ask is, I guess, you're talking about investing more organically and see some additional opportunities out there. And I guess, how do you balance that between an inorganic growth, acquiring something? And is this all accounted for in that $1.4 billion, these organic projects? Or do you think there could be some more upside here? 
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure. No, good question. Look, when we think about $1.4 billion in 2025, what gives us some confidence in that number, it being a relatively sticky number is, a lot of the large-scale downstream projects are accounted for. Daytona is coming online later this year. We've already announced Train 11. That's in there. We've talked about an export project. So on the downstream side, we don't really see a whole lot being added to 2025. So it really just comes to Gathering and Processing. And so there, I think what could move it, plus and minus is just overall field activity.
 If volumes are a lot stronger, we need to put in even more compression or more pipelines. There could be some upward or downward just depending on overall volumes and then adding processing plants. We've already got, as we mentioned, the Pembrook II that added in there. We're ordering long lead times for the next Delaware plant. That was already contemplated. So it would need to be a pretty big delta, I'd say, in overall growth expectations or growth realizations for us in G&P to have a large scale move. So that's why we feel pretty good about the $1.4 billion. As we go through the year and we give guidance, we'll refine it. And could have moved down a little bit up a little bit. We'll see. But I think we feel pretty good about the $1.4 billion for next year. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra from Bank of America. 
Indraneel Mitra: I was looking at the year-over-year bridge on the G&P segment, and one of the tailwinds in the quarter was higher fees. I was just wondering if you could explain what that is? Is it moving to more fixed fee contracts, escalators or higher fee floors. Just trying to understand what that comment is and what the driver looks for the quarter? 
Jennifer Kneale: Neel, this is Jen. We talked very openly on our February call, and you can even see it in our proxy and some of our disclosures that our commercial team was really successful continuing to put fee floors into some key contracts in the fourth quarter of 2023. And that's what's allowing us to announce a new processing plant, despite negative Waha prices today and very low NGL prices. So certainly appreciate the support and alignment of our producers related to that capital spend.
 So as you start to look at our quarter -- our year-over-year results, I think you'll continue to see that more and more, particularly in a commodity price environment that looks like today, that we are going to earn more and more fees in our gathering and processing business. So it's really the result of just more fee-based volume growth as well as fee floor growth in our Gathering and Processing business and our contracts. 
Indraneel Mitra: Okay. Perfect. And the second question on the L&T side. Fractionation volumes were down, looks scheduled downtime. Could you maybe provide how often you have scheduled downtime on the frac side? And then if you incur third-party frac costs this quarter that we publish and run through for the rest of the year. 
D. Pryor: Yes, Neel, this is Scott. When you look at the first quarter relative to fourth quarter of last year, yes, our frac volumes were down, but our fractionators were full in the fourth quarter, they were full in the first quarter, but just limited in terms of availability of space because of the downtime that we had that was scheduled as well as some of the impacts of the harsh winter weather that we had in January as well. .
 Looking forward for us into the second quarter, obviously, as Jim mentioned, we're really happy to see Train 9 in startup mode. And then we'll be really happy to see GCF start up sometime during this quarter as well. So when you look at our frac volumes, you're going to see a meaningful step-up in volumes into the second quarter for us when we come out of that quarter with Train 9 online and with GCF giving a partial contribution at the back end of the quarter as well. So I would anticipate that really to continue throughout third quarter and fourth quarter, again, with all the operating facilities. 
 In terms of scheduled maintenance, those just come periodically. There's no really -- there's scheduled maintenance that we have on certain vessels that we have to inspect due to requirements. And we work those in and try to make those really not impact us in terms of being able to perform for our customers overall. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. 
Keith Stanley: So I know the company is more fee-based than well-hedged this year, but I want to make sure with Waha prices being pretty extreme here that there's no meaningful impact from prices themselves on the company this year. And then related to that, just given Permian gas supply continues to beat expectations kind of over and over. At what point do you start to feel more pressure to move forward on a gas pipeline project like Apex? Is it -- do you need to see something happen by the summer, the fall or how you're thinking about that overall? 
Matt Meloy: Okay. Keith, yes, good question. I'll start with just talking a little bit about Waha and then Bobby and Pat can talk a little bit about that in the Permian supply. Yes. So there are pluses and minuses for us when we have really weak Waha prices. We have just -- still have some commodity sensitivity and some length for gas in our G&P business. A lot of that is protected by floors, and hybrids and fee-based contracts, we still have some length on natural gas. So when you see negative prices, that is a negative for us.
 We also move a lot of gas intra-basin and out of the basin, and we have large transport positions to make sure we can get the gas out of the basin. So when you have dislocations in Waha, we do have some gas marketing upticks relative to our transportation position. So that could be depending on where we're moving it and where we're able to get it to, there could be some positives there. So I'd say there's pluses and minuses. Overall, we would prefer higher Waha prices than lower. It's good for our customers, it's good for our business, but there are pluses and minuses to volatility in Waha and weaker Waha prices.
 And then on the Permian supply and gas lines, Bobby, you want to talk about that? 
Robert Muraro: Yes. So a couple of things relative to what Matt said, not use a phrase, it's [indiscernible] right? So every couple of years, we see Waha get crushed. We have those really defined forecasts relative to the wallet connection. So we're always planning, and Pat mentioned it earlier, with both our producers that market their own gas and taking kind and producers that we market for it. We are  ahead of this and planning to make sure we can move all the gas that comes out of our plants. So the immediate issue is ignoring issues on pipes that aren't expected. We're always set up to be ready for this because this happens every 2 years.
 Then relative to thinking about the next pipe, it's a similar refrain to what I've said before. Target is #1 priority, making sure gas moves out of the basin that our producers can flow their gas out of our plants and we can move the gas, if we move for producers out of our plants. And we are working on multiple fronts, multiple options, multiple pipes, all that have, I'll call, very good traction. I fully expect -- I've said this before, that pipe will go FID by the end of this year. If we make good progress on one of the options that the industry does, it could go earlier than year-end. I won't guess to what month, but I fully expect gas pipeline to go and go this year.
 When you think about Waha, where it is, things like that on the margin, motivate shippers and pipe owners even more to get things done. So I have as much confidence today. It's just 3 months closer than last call that something will go FID. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson from Scotiabank. 
Tristan Richardson: A lot has been asked and answered. But maybe just one for me on the CapEx side. I think last quarter, in [indiscernible] call, you offered that illustrative annual spending example [ one ]. And if we look at '25, it seems like with another Midland plant and another frac announced today, 2025 will look a lot like what you've laid out in that hypothetical, but the '25 guide is quite a bit below, 20% below. So just thinking about maybe where we're deviating from some of that illustrative example. And just maybe where you're seeing actuals in '25 looking better than some of that illustrative spend that you guys laid out last quarter? 
Matt Meloy: Yes, Tristan, I think probably the biggest delta versus the average is completing Daytona this year. We shouldn't have any NGL transport to speak of on a multiyear basis. That's one item. 
Jennifer Kneale: And then the other one would be really low-cost export expansion we have, we've got in that illustrative multiyear guidance spending, for both transport and exports, that we wouldn't expect to need to do in a meaningful way in 2025. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal from Seaport Global. 
Sunil Sibal: So I wanted to start off on the infrastructure side in Permian. I think you've previously talked about how you'll kind of debottleneck the Permian portion of Grand Prix through pump capacity additions and all that. Could you talk about where does your kind of current capacity stands there? And obviously, Daytona comes online later this year. How should we think about volume trending on that and competition for third-party volumes per se? 
D. Pryor: Sunil, this is Scott. Yes, with the Daytona coming online in the fourth quarter of this year, just as a reminder, when we bring that online, we're anticipating the initial throughput or capacity to be around 400,000 barrels a day. And with the ability to add pump stations over time where it makes sense as we see the growth in our G&P business filtering in and through our pipelines. So those capacities, similar to what we did on the West leg of Grand Prix, that can put us over 600,000 barrels a day between that. So that gives us a lot of operating leverage on the West side of the portion of Grand Prix with Daytona coming online.
 When you look at our South leg, we've got a lot of operating capacity there. Again, the capacity is around 1 million barrels a day. We're bringing in just over 700,000 barrels a day currently. So that gives us also some operating leverage as it relates to that. And when you look at the numbers, we move today, there's a lot of volume that still comes into our facility that comes from third-party pipes. We participate in moving some volume on some of those third-party pipes as well as our customers do. And I would anticipate continuing to see that happening over a period of time.
 We'll have to evaluate relative to when we would have to do a South leg expansion, if you will. But I think we've got a lot of runway for right now, and then we can look to participate on third-party pipes where it makes sense, both physically as well as economically for us. 
Robert Muraro: And this is Bobby. Yes, about third-party competition. We've talked about this before. We are a wellhead-to-water company, right? So we build Grand Prix, we build Daytona, we build our NGL structure service our G&P footprint that goes out to the wellhead. A vast majority of the liquids that come out of our plants go down our NGL pipes, and we anticipate that being the same going forward. The third-party business exists within Targa, but that's not the driver of Targa's NGL business. It is our wellhead-to-water starting at the wellhead. 
Sunil Sibal: Okay. And then as a follow-up, I think, on the strategic side of things, I was curious how do you think of your assets outside of Permian, seems like, if I remember correctly, the Badlands JV is past the 5-year mark. How should we think about your assets outside the Permian, you still kind of give them as free cash flow positive assets or are there any investment opportunities outside that? 
Matt Meloy: Yes. Most of the activity is obviously around our Permian and related NGL infrastructure. That's where the activity is. That's where the growth is happening. And the other assets, there's not a lot at -- especially with weaker gas prices. When gas prices moved up in '22, we started to see some activity, but you're seeing volumes move off, which is not unexpected. So to the extent there are some opportunities and there are some limited opportunities in the Central region to go get packages of gas and compete, we go do that, and we're looking to grow where it makes sense or get additional packages of gas where it makes sense in those businesses.
 I'd say, up in the Badlands we're actually through the remainder of this year and into next year, seeing some strong activity, we'd expect there actually to probably be some growth in our Badlands business over the rest of this year into next year. So we're seeing some good activity up there. And if it's economic and it makes sense for us, we'll go and continue to grow that business and other businesses. It's just there's less opportunities outside the Permian. 
Operator: And for our final question today comes from the line of Zach Van Everen from TPH & Company. 
Zackery Van Everen: Just want to go back to the Permian egress solution. You mentioned FID by the end of this year potentially. Just curious how you think about markets in 2026. Consensus seems to be like '26 is when we'll need a new pipe. So curious on if you kind of agree with that. And is the 2-year time frame, what you guys are hearing to build another gas egress pipe. 
Robert Muraro: This is Bobby. Yes. No, I think we've reiterated that on multiple calls. We see '26 as the year for a need for another full pipe out of the basin, whether that's earlier in the year or later in the year, we'll be prepared for whatever that answer is, as we move forward in time. And I think, generally speaking, yes, the 24 months from FID is kind of the number that everybody talks about, sometimes you talk about '26, maybe it's '22, maybe it's '28, but '24 is the good guideline that I think the whole industry uses for the construction of that pipe. So -- and yes, I'm fully confident that if we'll go -- something will go FID before the end of the year that solves the '26 basin issue. 
Zackery Van Everen: Got it. Perfect. And then flipping over to propane. I just want to get your views for the rest of the year. We've seen production come in pretty hot and storage is still over the 5 years. So I just want to get your views there. And then you could remind us of how much marketing you guys have on the docks that can capture that international spread. 
D. Pryor: Zach, this is Scott. We've certainly seen increased production really across the board as it relates to the additive of production coming out of the Permian as a whole from a U.S. production perspective. The draws of late have been relatively weak, if you will. So yes, we're kind of seeing year-on-year similar type inventories. And that's the reason why I think you're also seeing max levels, if you will, or high utilization levels of exports across the dock, whether it's us or even the competition in the marketplace. Some of that's going to get solved by some of the expansion projects that have already been announced.
 Of course, we have a small complementary one that we just announced this morning. So folks will be gearing up to push that -- push those across the dock. Basically, product will have to get price to move typically on to the water, and that will aid in developing other marketplaces really across the globe, whether you're feeding again, domestic use, petrochemical use or PDH use. And I fully anticipate that to continue. We continue to hear that the shipping industry also is adding ships to accommodate the need for those types of movements as well. So I think we will all see a benefit of that as we move forward in time. 
Operator: This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Sanjay for any further remarks. 
Sanjay Lad: Thanks to everyone that was on the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you have. Have a great day. 
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-15 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Targa Resources Corp. Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Webcast and Presentation. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Sanjay Lad, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks, Shannon. Good morning and welcome to the fourth quarter 2023 earnings call for Targa Resources Corp. The fourth quarter earnings release, along with the fourth quarter earnings supplement presentation for Targa that accompany our call, are available on our website at targaresources.com in the Investors section. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. Statements made during this call that might include Targa's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings. Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer; and Jen Kneale, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, we'll have the following senior management team members available for Q&A: Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Matt.
Matt Meloy : Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning. 2023 was another record year for Targa. And I would like to recognize and thank our employees for their focus, dedication and execution throughout the year. Some of our highlights for 2023 include record safety performance; record Gathering and Processing volumes in the Permian; record volumes across our logistics and transportation assets; record adjusted EBITDA of $3.53 billion, a 22% increase over 2022, while also reducing our share count; major projects came online on time, on budget and have been highly utilized since start-up; ended the year with 90% of our G&P volumes fee-based or with fee floor; positive outlook to our current investment-grade ratings with each of the three agencies and the completion of two successful notes offerings; and higher year-over-year return of capital to our shareholders through both an increased common dividend and record common share repurchases. Our performance was particularly strong given Waha natural gas and NGL prices were about 64% and 34% lower year-over-year. And we benefited from margin from fee floors in our Gathering and Processing business across 10 of 12 months, demonstrating our business is more insulated to downside -- to downward commodity prices than ever before. We also exited 2023 with a lot of volume momentum in the Permian. Our December reported inlet averaged 5.5 billion cubic feet per day, a 450 million cubic feet per day improvement from our third quarter average. While our volume ramp materialized later than we forecasted for 2023, we are pleased that we ended the year with December actuals in line with our original guidance expectations for the Permian, providing us with strong momentum in 2024. We expect another year of record financial and operational metrics with full year adjusted EBITDA estimated to be between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion for 2024.  The significant year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA is primarily driven by higher expected Permian Gathering and Processing volumes and higher expected NGL transport fractionation and export volumes. Consensus growth expectations for Permian-associated gas in 2024 is about 9%. And given our track record of outperforming the basin, we are installing over 400 million cubic feet per day of compression in the first half of 2024, which will drive increasing volumes through our downstream assets. We currently estimate between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion of growth capital spending in 2024 as we bring online two Permian plants, three fractionators in an NGL pipeline while also spending on projects that will come online beyond 2024, including additional Permian plants and fractionation trains. Beyond these projects already announced and under construction, we're also ordering long lead time items for our next Permian plants and frac Train 11 to ensure we keep pace with the significant activity we continue to see. Backed by the strength of our outlook and increasing stability of our cash flows we announced in November an expectation of a 50% year-over-year increase to our annualized 2024 common dividend per share. The increased dividend will be recommended to our board in April for the first quarter of 2024 with payment to shareholders in May.  We also repurchased a record $374 million of common shares in 2023 and continue to be in position to execute on our opportunistic share repurchase program in 2024. Beyond 2024, we really like our positioning driven by a view of cost-advantaged basins like the Permian continuing to be a key supplier of hydrocarbons for decades to come. As we look to 2025, we estimate about $1.4 billion of growth capital spending burdened by the next major projects that are not currently board approved but would be necessary to support continued volume growth, including Train 11 and additional Permian G&P plants.  With increasing EBITDA in 2025 relative 2024 and lower estimated growth capital spending, we expect to generate significant free cash flow in 2025. Also, we included in our presentation slides this morning an illustrative buildup of multiyear average spending that would approximate about $1.7 billion per year. This assumes high single digit gas volume growth in the Permian, requiring us to continue to add infrastructure across our value chain. $1.7 billion of capital spending at a 5.5 times multiple would drive over $300 million of EBITDA growth year-over-year and increasing free cash flow, supporting our ability to continue to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. We also included our estimated spending to maintain volumes currently on our system, which we think is helpful in demonstrating the resiliency of our business. Growth capital spending to maintain existing volumes is estimated at around $300 million annually, which is informed by how quickly we're able to rationalize spending in 2020 and 2021, when we still had strong volume growth across our assets.  In a scenario of $300 million of annual growth capital spend, we would be in a position to utilize significant free cash flow to continue to return capital to shareholders while maintaining a very strong balance sheet.  As we look forward, our excitement is our -- our excitement and our outlook is driven by a few things. First, we have the largest Permian Gathering and Processing footprint in the industry with several million dedicated acres across Midland and Delaware Basins. That, coupled with an integrated NGL system, positions us nicely to generate high return organic opportunities to invest around $1.7 billion annually over a multiyear average, delivering over $300 million of annual EBITDA growth, driving significant free cash flow and positions Targa to continue to meaningfully increase the amount of capital returned to shareholders and deliver significant value to our shareholders over the long term. Let's now discuss our operations in more detail. Starting in the Permian, activity continues to remain strong across our dedicated acreage. Fourth quarter inlet volumes averaged a record 5.3 billion cubic feet per day, an 11% increase when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. We brought online significant compression across our Midland and Delaware systems during the fourth quarter, driving a 5% sequential increase in volumes. In Permian Midland, our new 275 million a day Greenwood plant, which commenced operations during the fourth quarter, is already highly utilized. Our next Midland plant, Greenwood II, remains on track to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2024 and is expected to be much needed when it comes online. In the Permian Delaware, activity in volumes across our footprint are also running strong. We brought online our new 275 million a day Wildcat II plant in late fourth quarter, and it's already highly utilized. Our Roadrunner II and Bull Moose plants remain on track to begin operations in the second quarters of 2024 and 2025, respectively. As mentioned earlier, we are ordering long lead time items for our next Permian plants to support continued production growth across our footprint. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. Targa's NGL pipeline transportation volumes were a record 722,000 barrels per day, and fractionation volumes were a record 845,000 barrels per day during the fourth quarter. Our Grand Prix NGL pipeline deliveries into Mont Belvieu increased 9% sequentially as we benefited from increased supply from our Permian G&P systems and higher third-party volumes. The outlook for NGL supply growth from our G&P footprint and third parties remains robust, and our Daytona NGL pipeline expansion will be much needed to handle growth from our system. We have obtained all required permits and have commenced construction on Daytona. We now expect the pipeline to begin operations ahead of schedule in early fourth quarter of this year, assuming favorable weather conditions. Our fractionation complex in Mont Belvieu continues to operate near capacity. And we expect our Train 9 fractionator to be highly utilized when it commences operations during the second quarter of 2024. The restart of GCF will also provide much-needed capacity when it is fully online during the second quarter of 2024. Our Train 10 fractionator is also expected to be much needed given the anticipated growth in our G&P business and corresponding plan additions and remains on track for the first quarter of 2025.  As mentioned earlier, also ordering long lead items for Train 11 support continued production growth across our footprint. In our LPG export business at Galena Park, our loadings were a record 13.3 million barrels per month during the fourth quarter as we benefited from our recently completed expansion, strong market conditions and the Houston Ship Channel allowance of nighttime transits for larger vessels, providing strong momentum for 2024. Before I turn the call over to Jen to discuss fourth quarter results in more detail as well as our expectations for 2024, I would like to extend a second thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution while continuing to provide best-in-class service and reliability to our customers.
Jen Kneale : Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $960 million, a 14% increase over the third quarter. The sequential increase was attributable to higher Permian volumes, which resulted in higher system volumes across our integrated NGL business.  Full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA was roughly $3.53 billion, supported by record financial and operational metrics across the company. We spent approximately $2.2 billion on growth capital projects and $223 million in net maintenance capital during 2023, largely in line with our previous estimates.  In November, we successfully completed a $1 billion offering of 6.15% coupon senior notes due 2029 and a $1 billion offering of 6.5% coupon senior notes due 2034. This allowed us to reduce our term loan borrowings by $1 billion and enhance our liquidity position. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $2.7 billion of available liquidity and our net consolidated leverage ratio was approximately 3.6 times, well within our long-term leverage ratio target range of 3 to 4 times. Also, this morning in an announcement that was made public while we were on this call, S&P has upgraded us to BBB, reflective of the progress we have made to date and our outlook for the future. Turning to our expectations for 2024. We are really excited about that short and longer term outlook. We estimate full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion, an 8% increase over 2023 based on the midpoint of our range, assuming commodity prices of $1.80 per MMBtu for Waha natural gas, $0.65 per gallon for our weighted average NGL barrel and $75 per WTI crude oil barrel.  We expect first quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be lower than fourth quarter 2023 as volumes across our systems were impacted by very cold winter weather, and operating expenses are increasing in anticipation of system expansions across both our segments. We expect quarterly adjusted EBITDA to increase sequentially as we move through the year and benefit from increasing volumes across our systems. We estimate $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion of growth capital spending for 2024, including the vast majority of spending on Greenwood II, Bull Moose, Daytona and Train 10. Our estimate for net maintenance capital spending is about $225 million reflective of our spending in 2023 and the increased assets that our operations teams are managing. We expect to end 2024 with our leverage ratio comfortably within our long-term leverage ratio target range of 3 to 4 times, providing continued flexibility going forward. We are well hedged across all commodities for the balance of 2024 and continue to add hedges for 2025 and beyond. The combination of hedges and fee-based margin across our businesses will continue to provide us with cash flow stability. Our fee floors in our G&P business support our ability to invest across lower commodity price environments while positioning us to benefit from higher commodity prices.  Relative to our full year 2024 financial guidance, a 30% move higher in commodity prices would increase full year adjusted EBITDA by around $165 million, while a 30% decrease would reduce adjusted EBITDA by around $75 million. As Matt described earlier, we also provided you with our current view of 2025 growth capital spending and an illustrative multiyear buildup across a couple of scenarios. We hope these are helpful. Our goal in providing them was to highlight some key points. We believe that there will continue to be strong growth in Permian volumes on our system going forward, which is going to drive incremental volumes through our downstream assets, requiring continued investments, which will continue to be at attractive returns, particularly given our efforts around adding fees and fee floors.  Downstream projects are larger and spending is lumpier. As those projects come online and we benefit from the operating leverage associated with increased available capacity, our growth capital spending moderates as evidenced by our current expectation of $1.4 billion of capital spend in 2025. Across multiple years, we would expect growth capital spend in an environment of continued volume growth to approximate around $1.7 billion. We are bullish Permian growth going forward but are often asked the question, how much capital would it take to maintain volumes? And our answer is approximately $300 million. This is not a scenario that we anticipate. It is merely intended to be instructive and hopefully helpful in demonstrating the strength of the Targa value proposition across the downside scenario, when the strength of our free cash flow generation and balance sheet would leave us very well positioned. Shifting to capital allocation. Our priorities remain the same, which are to maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet to continue to invest in high-returning integrated projects and to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles.  As Matt described, underpinned by the strength of our business outlook for 2024 and beyond, we plan to recommend to our board a 50% increase in the 2024 annual common dividend, $3 per share, and we expect to be able to grow our dividend meaningfully thereafter. We also expect to remain in a position to continue to execute opportunistically under our common share repurchase program. In 2023, we repurchased a Targa record $374 million of common shares at a weighted average price of $76.72 with $41 million repurchased during the fourth quarter. We had about $770 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase program at the end of the fourth quarter. Across our base scenarios, we are continuing to model the ability over time to return 40% to 50% of cash flow from operations to equity holders, providing a framework for thinking through our return of capital proposition looking forward. As it relates to taxes, based on our estimate for earnings and spending and current tax policy, there's no change to our assumptions that we may be subject to the federal minimum tax in 2026 and a full cash taxpayer in 2027. We believe that we continue to offer a unique value proposition for our shareholders and potential shareholders, growing EBITDA, a growing common dividend per share, reducing share count and excellent short, medium and long-term assets -- outlook, excuse me. Our talented team continues to execute on our strategic priorities and safely operate our assets to deliver the energy that enhances our everyday life. And we are very thankful for the efforts of all of our employees. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Lad : Thanks, Jen. For the Q&A session, we kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow up and enter the Q&A line up if you have additional question. Shannon, would you please open the line for Q&A?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan Securities, LLC. Your line is now open 
Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. 
Matt Meloy : Hey, good morning, Jeremy. 
Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to start off, I guess, with the news about 2025 CapEx stepping down so significantly versus 2024, creating a lot of flexibility there as it relates to return on capital. Just wondering if you might be able to provide a little bit more detail as far as thoughts on capital allocation at that point in weighting dividend growth relative to buybacks. Just kind of any other -- any incremental color would be helpful there with that extra -- with that $1 billion step-down in CapEx.
Jen Kneale : Good morning, Jeremy. This is Jen. I think that we're really excited about 2025 and the possibilities for Targa and our shareholders. There's really no change to how we are thinking about return of capital. I think part of the excitement that we have around this year, next year and really many years to come is that we believe we offer a really unique value proposition, where we will be in position from a significantly increasing amount of free cash flow to meaningfully increase our common dividends per share and continue to execute under our opportunistic share repurchase program. We published the framework in November that said that we would expect to be in a position to return 40% to 50% of cash flow from operations to our shareholders. And that's what we're modeling. And as we get into 2025 and beyond, that means that there's a lot of incremental capital that can flow to our shareholders. And again, that's really what is underpinning what we think should be a very exciting Targa story for both our company and our shareholders.
Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Thank you for that. And maybe just pivoting towards LPG exports, a good step-up there. Just wondering if you could comment a bit more if the lifting of daylight hour restriction, I think, it is planned and we expect the Port Authority to drop the trial moniker not too far down the road here. I'm just wondering how you think that impacts Targa capacity when the daylight hour restriction is fully removed then?
Scott Pryor : Hey, Jeremy, this is Scott. First off, you're right, fourth quarter was a really nice quarter for us with over 13 million barrels per month, which was a combination of both propanes and butanes across the dock. Certainly, a couple of benefits there that we took in -- to our advantage. One was obviously the export expansion project that we had that increased our refrigeration capacity, increased our ability to load vessels faster. And we were able to operate through the -- really the entire fourth quarter, so we got the step up with that. The nighttime transits that were lifted or provided another benefit. So the Houston Ship Channel, along with the Houston pilots, collaborated together to provide that to the industry as a whole. Targa benefited from that as a result of that. I would say that nominally speaking, we think that, that probably provided us about a 5% to 10% benefit. It's difficult to really pin that down because there's a variety of factors that play into that. And on top of that, we were able to benefit from spot activity as a result of those increased liftings. I would like to add that I give a huge thank you to the Houston pilots and the Houston Ship Channel. That provides that change in nighttime transit that they have done very safely, effectively and efficiently, not only benefits Targa, but it really benefits a wide variety of industries along the Houston Ship Channel that help drive Texas economy as well as the U.S. economy. So going forward into 2024, you're right, currently today it is kind of labeled as a trial period. But I think based upon the success that they've had, the safe operating environment that they've been able to conduct themselves under, we view this really as a long-term change. And we will continue to benefit from it. We hope to find other ways to optimize around that as we learn more about the nighttime transits and the vessels that are available to move through that process.
Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Okay. So it sounds like there could be upside down the road versus the 5 to 10?
Scott Pryor : Well, what I would say is, I think that in the fourth quarter, it was not -- the nighttime transits were not a part of the entire fourth quarter. It really got instituted in November. And I think that we will hopefully find some better ways to optimize around it, again, as we learn more about the program. So it benefited us now, and we'll continue to see how that fares for us going forward.
Matt Meloy : Yeah. It's still early, Jeremy. So I think we're thinking 5% to 10% is a good -- kind of a good range of upside right now, but it's still pretty early.
Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you. 
Sanjay Lad: Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis with Citi. Your line is now open. 
Spiro Dounis : Thanks, operator. Good morning, team. Wanted to go back to Permian production quickly. Jen, you had mentioned maybe a slower start to the year, and I think that's pretty consistent with what producers are saying. Just curious, though, as we think about the year as a whole, can you give us a sense of what Permian production growth is underwriting the guidance? And to the extent that it's back half loaded, what that implies about 2025?
Jen Kneale : I think that we're continuing to see a lot of very robust growth on our Permian assets. A couple of important points that I think were mentioned in scripted comments were, one, that by the time that we got to the end of 2023, we actually outpaced our initial expectations for the year. While that growth materialized a little bit more slowly than we expected, it did materialize and ended up exceeding expectations at year-end. What I was trying to highlight was we did experience some extreme winter weather here thus far to start the year, and that will impact our Q1 results. But our operations teams are doing an excellent job of getting our assets back up and running. So as we think about the balance of this year and beyond, I think you've seen our track record that we outperform the expectations for growth out of the Permian Basin on the gas side. And there's nothing that we're seeing that would change that trend in any meaningful way. We didn't give a statistic this year for Permian growth relative to what we've provided previously in the past. One, just because we think that individual operational statistics are less meaningful than some of the high-level corporate information that we give. And I think that our performance in 2023 highlighted that a little bit, right? Our volumes ended up coming in a little bit lower than our initial guidance for the full year average. But again, we exited higher than we initially anticipated. So everything is just really setting up well for our continued execution across both the Midland and the Delaware Basin. And we have a very strong outlook for robust continued growth for as long as we can see.
Spiro Dounis : Got it. Thanks a lot, Jen. Second question, maybe going to 2025. I know you're not providing '25 EBITDA today, but some of the materials did maybe give us some tools on how to help think about that. You guys are pointing to significant growth. You've also talked about in the slides $300 million of annual EBITDA growth with $1.7 billion of spending. So I guess, if I look back at '23-'24, spending over $2 billion in each of these years, it would seem like as we think about the lease of '25, over $300 million of EBITDA growth would seem like an easy hurdle. But I don't want to get too ahead of myself.
Matt Meloy : Yeah, yeah. I think what I'd say is we feel really good about our position coming out of '24 going into '25. I think '25 is going to set up very well. I think we see significant EBITDA growth in '25, and frankly, beyond '25.  We guided 2.3 to 2.5 of CapEx this year. We were about 2.2 last year. So the kind of 5.5 times investment multiple is a multiyear average. It's not -- you spend a set amount in one year so it results in EBITDA in that year. It's a multiyear average that we think we can do, call it, 5 to 6 times EBITDA on our CapEx. So when you kind of look at what we spent the last couple of years, I think it just sets up for a very strong 2025. We decided not to give EBITDA guidance for '25, but just kind of point you to our historical spending and just the overall volume trajectory that we're seeing across our footprint is just going to set up very nice for us in '25.
Spiro Dounis : Fair enough. Thanks for that, Matt. Appreciate the time today. 
Sanjay Lad: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Reynolds with UBS. Your line is now open. 
Brian Reynolds : Hi, good morning everyone. Maybe to follow up on some of the kind of long-term EBITDA growth outlook, I think you outlined kind of a build multiple around 5.5 times. I think a quarter or two ago, you kind of outlined in the past three years that some of these projects came in at much lower multiples. So kind of just trying to understand maybe the difference there if you can -- maybe there's some doses of conservatism in the build or whether the commodity has anything to play with that and whether we could maybe see some upside to the EBITDA build multiple. Thanks. 
Matt Meloy : Sure. No, good question. I mean, really, historically, you go back years, we kind of said 5 to 7 times build multiple is kind of what we targeted. We've been able to do better than that. I think that was just kind of some cushion in that 5 to 7. If you look back at the last five years, we've really been kind of closer to a 4 times build multiple. We've had really good volume growth across our system. And the Permian, Grand Prix filled up much quicker even than our expectations, which just drove the returns even higher.  So I think we've really had some strong performance. But I'd say there's really nothing fundamentally different in what we're investing in this year and next year, go forward than what we invested in, in the past where we did have a lower investment multiple. I'd say perhaps there's a little bit of conservatism put into that number. But it's not -- there's not a large delta from commodity prices one way or the other. I'd say we have more commodity price upside given the fee floors that Jen and we've talked about, which could drive that lower if we get some commodity price tailwinds.
Jen Kneale : I would just add that, I think, Brian, the conservatism is further highlighted by how highly utilized we think our projects will be that are in progress right now when they come online, which has been really the same playbook that we benefited from over the last many years. It feels like we're just in time on a number of our assets, which is great for the finance person in the room because it means that they're very highly utilized at start-up and provide significant incremental cash flow very quickly. It makes it a little bit tougher for our operations and engineering teams, of course, as they try to plan.  But I think that that's part of the conservatism as well that really is reflective in the 5.5 times versus the realized multiples that you've seen across our footprint.
Brian Reynolds : Great. Thanks. And maybe as a follow-up to Spiro's question on just Permian and the growth. Previously, you kind of gave more of a firm number around 10%. And then the illustrative guide, you kind of talk high single digits. Maybe just talk about that's kind of your base expectation at this point. And then kind of as a follow-up, has any of the M&A -- any updated view on some acquisitions in the Midland impacting your thought process there?  And then just on the operational hiccups, are we past that? And as it relates to H2S gas quality issues, how does your system able to manage that sour gas and potentially grow at a higher clip than the rest of the basin? Thanks. 
Matt Meloy : Okay. I'll start and then Pat can probably touch on a little bit of this, too. I think when you look at our Permian growth for the year, we really feel good about where we're starting the year. December was our highest month, and it really just sets us up for really good production growth just where we exited 2023 going into '24. So even with relatively modest growth from here, we're going to see a really strong year-over-year. And that's why we've said consensus is about 9%. We've typically beat that. But even if we get anywhere around high single digits or a little bit better, I think it sets us up very well, not only for '24 'but 25. And then I'll let Pat speak a little bit to kind of the M&A landscape from our E&P customers.
Pat McDonie : Yeah. There's been a lot of M&A activity over the last three to four years. So it's not something we're unfamiliar with. And frankly, we don't see a material difference with these new announcements as we've seen in the past. Frankly, we've seen pretty consistent growth across the combined companies relative to our position with the individual companies.  The new ones that are coming out, we have meaningful positions with all the parties. We have long-term contracts with all the parties. We have great relationships with all those producers. If you look at what's been publicly announced by those parties, you wouldn't expect a significant impact to what their expected growth levels are going to be. Frankly, at least on one of the major -- the bigger mergers, there's -- you could allow that there's going to be an expectation of incremental growth on our assets on the Midland side of the basin.  So there is a lot of activity, a lot going on, but we've benefited from it because we've got great assets, we're reliable. We've got good contracts, and we've got good relationships.
Matt Meloy : Yeah. And just to add to that, too, the other part of your question was around gas quality and trading. A lot of the -- we are spending a lot of capital, and we spent last year and this year 4 additional treating facilities primarily in the Delaware Basin. We're putting in some additional treaters to handle both CO2 and H2S, and we're drilling multiple wells to handle that as gas injection wells and pipelines and connectivity to handle that. So I think that really positions us nicely as the Delaware continues to grow and gas quality becomes another issue that the producer are going to have to deal with, we'll be in a really good position to handle that. And most of that capital will be in or the large -- the lion's share of it will be in kind of by the end of this year.
Jen Kneale : And then I think the very last question in your question was around whether volumes had rebounded as a result of the impact of winter storm. And I'm really proud -- I think we're all really proud of the efforts of our operations teams to get volumes back online. So we're close to back to levels that we were seeing before we experienced the extreme weather.
Brian Reynolds : Great. Thanks. Appreciate all the color this morning. Thanks. 
Sanjay Lad: Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank. Your line is now open. 
Tristan Richardson : Hi, good morning. Jen, pardon, my voice this morning, but really appreciate the CapEx sensitivity you guys laid out and really curious about the flexibility you have in that '25 outlook. Certainly, you talked about that high single digit embedded in that assumption. But can you talk about timing that spend in the event producers deviate from that assumption, whether that is deferring Train 11 timing your plan towards the end of '25? And then also maybe just about does Greenwood II and Bull Moose coming on towards the second half of '24? Is that adequate capacity to support that sort of high single-digit inlet for '25 in the illustrative?
Matt Meloy : Yeah. So as we think about '24 and then going into '25, we're ordering some long lead time, have some spending for Train 11, which will both be in '24 and '25. And then we also mentioned there's additional plants, call it, two plants, maybe one in the Delaware, one in the Midland, of additional ordering long lead time and in kind of our base assumption that we're going to need to start spending capital on this going to have '24 and '25 budget.  So that's kind of what we have in our budget right now. Sure, if there's even more production growth in the Permian, could that move that plant timing up a little bit? It could move it up a little bit. If it's perhaps on the lower end of the growth ranges, could we push those out? Yeah, we could push that out a little bit. Really, the big sensitivities to our CapEx does -- it really tends to be more on the downstream side. Are we going to need -- when is the next fractionator? What about -- Daytona's coming on, should give us some good runway from an NGL perspective. But when will you need more transportation and then export? Those are the larger projects that can be a bit lumpier. So I think '25, a lot of that up and down really could just be around our G&P business and some of the plant timing and related field capital.
Tristan Richardson : Super helpful. Appreciate it, Matt. And then just a quick follow-up. Talking about the 90% fee-based now. I mean, I think a substantial move from '23. Clearly, this is a multiyear priority for you guys and has been a game of inches. Are you seeing a big change in '24 really a function of mix? And where -- which of your producers are growing? Or did you see some substantial kind of recuts or recontracting occur throughout '23?
Matt Meloy : Yeah. We've been making steady progress on getting more fee-based components, primarily fee floors but also just fee-based G&P business, over the last several years. Our commercial team really did a fantastic job in 2023. And I would say there was a step-change in just the number of contracts that we were able to get redone. So no, it was a step-change late in '23, which significantly changed our overall downside risk profile and is done.  So now we're estimating 90%. You see that on our commodity price sensitivity. We still have some length. So there is some downside if prices moved down. But relative to our overall size of 30% downside, $60 million, $70 million, that's not much sensitivity. That is fundamentally different than where we were really 12-24 and certainly 36 months ago.
Tristan Richardson : Yeah, appreciate. Thanks very much, Matt. 
Matt Meloy : Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is now open. 
Theresa Chen : Good morning. I have a question following up on Tristan's question related to the fee floors within your G&P segment. Just thinking about the 90% at this point, as you have put in additional fee floors within your POP contracts overtime, is the mix of fee-based versus POP with the floor within that 90% changing, i.e. is the incremental fee-based contract really putting in fee floors for POP? Or have you exchanged some previous legacy fee-based contracts for POP with the floors as you renegotiate? And just really trying to understand the rationale behind why your customers would allow you to put in fee floors overtime.
Jen Kneale : This is Jen. It's actually a mixture of what you talked about but for different reasons. You've seen the percent of our G&P business that is fee-based increase largely as a result of acquisition. When we bought Lucid, primarily underpinning the Lucid contracts that we acquired were largely fee-based contracts. And so we saw a big step change in the increase of fees generated from our G&P business associated with that acquisition. But what our commercial team has been really successful at doing, and I would also like to take my hats off to all of them because it's been just a huge effort that I think has very meaningful implications for our company, is they have gone in and worked with producers to really demonstrate that in order to incentivize Targa to be willing to spend capital. And this goes back to 2020. This is an effort that we have been building on -- building momentum on over the last many, many years. But going back to those conversations, in order for Targa to be willing to continue to invest capital, what you've seen us consistently do over the last many years. We need to make sure that we will get an adequate rate of return in a downside commodity price environment. It's simply just the math. And our producers have been very supportive of that construct. So we've gone into existing POP contracts, and we've been able to restructure those to put the fee floors in place that, again, have incentivized us to continue to spend capital even as commodity prices are lower while not giving up the upside to the extent commodity prices rise. And so it's really been a mix of we've acquired a lot of fee-based assets on the G&P side, and then we've gone in and we've either restructured existing contracts or as new contracts have been put in place by our commercial team, they've been put in place with that fee floor structure while also generating returns across our integrated system.  And the commercial teams have really just done a very good job supporting our producers with what our producers need but under a construct that also works for us to continue to capital.
Theresa Chen : That's helpful. Thank you. And then when we think about the long-term illustrative CapEx, so going from 1.4 back to the 1.7 on a multiyear basis and thinking through the next lumpy projects in the downstream segment. In addition to additional fractionation and export capacity, the eventual looping of the 30-inch segment of Grand Prix, can you talk about at this juncture with the growth that you have had you and Daytona coming online by year-end and filling up thereafter, what the cadence of build and spend would be for that 30-inch loop? And how do we get from 1.4 to 1.7 or beyond in the years to come?
Matt Meloy : Yeah. Sure. Good question. So I would say the primary delta from the 1.4 to 1.7 is downstream spending, having multiple fractionation facilities and that's really more this year. But really the delta between 1.4 and 1.7 is primarily downstream. One of the larger projects that we don't have any meaningful spending on next year is transportation, another NGL pipe. We have Daytona coming on this year. That's going to provide us some good runway. So then how much runway that provides really depends on what the overall growth rate in the Permian and our capture of those NGL barrels to move on to Daytona. So that is something we're thinking about. These pipes take a couple of years to get billed, probably even a little bit longer than that. So we had to look out two-three years and say, when do we need to think about looping that 30-inch segment. There's also available transport out there from some of our competitors. So we can move -- I think we'll move the lion's share of our volumes on our own pipe. There can be transportation agreements that can be had with some of our competitors as well. So really, for us, all options are on the table, whether it's us building a 30-inch down the road or utilizing some excess capacity from some other NGL pipes.
Scott Pryor : Yeah. And Matt, I would just add the fact that our West leg, we've shown that we can actually operate that above the 600,000 barrel a day nameplate that we have kind of put out there. So that volume along the West leg, along with volumes that are coming in from the north are all feeding through the 30-inch pipeline. We've got still a lot of operating leverage with the 30-inch pipeline. And certainly, Daytona provides us a lot of operating leverage going forward for periods of time.
Theresa Chen : Thank you. 
Matt Meloy : Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra with Bank of America. Your line is now open. 
Neel Mitra : Hi, good morning. Thanks for all the detail on the CapEx spend. I wanted to follow up on the last question and the $550 million related mostly to downstream. Assuming you're spending about half of a frac each year, that leaves about $300 million each year for, on average, transportation and exports. So first of all, is there any ability to meaningfully expand Galena Park at this time? Are there land constraints?  And then second, with the NGL pipe build oversupply, do you see your need for expanding pipe elongated just because you're able to hold your pricing power when others are competing for barrels?
Scott Pryor : Neel, this is Scott. I'll start it off and just say that let's -- when we first think about the pipe, recognize that today, we utilize third-party pipes for volumes that are coming into our Belvieu facility today. And when we think about the growth that we have on the G&P side and the Daytona pipeline, we are not out there fighting for fees relative to fill up our existing capacity and our expected capacity that we would have on Daytona. So all of that kind of folds hand-in-hand with the growth that Pat and his team on the G&P side have relative to transportation. Matt alluded to the fact that if there is capacity on industry pipes, we -- again, because we utilize that today, we can always look for opportunities to utilize that to bridge us to whenever we might need to do a loop around our existing system. As it relates to Galena Park, we have a really good idea of what the next expansion project looks like. And it's a variety of factors from adding refrigeration to adding pipe, to adding potential docks and things of that nature. So we're keeping, obviously, a close eye on what that timing needs to be relative to our growth, again, driven by our G&P business. And we'll continue to evaluate that. So I will say, again, the expansion that we had in the fourth quarter that we're benefiting from today, the nighttime transits, both of those really are hand-in-hand expansion projects on their own without having to spend a lot of capital. So we'll continue to look for ways to debottleneck if possible to get incremental capacity as well.  So I think we've got a lot of opportunity and some runway with the existing assets that we have. But we do have space available to expand at Galena Park.
Neel Mitra : Perfect. And if I could just follow up quickly. One of your peers mentioned for their oil outlook in the Permian that almost all of the growth would come out of the Delaware versus the Midland. I know that you aren't necessarily representative of the overall basin. But could you just perhaps break out what you're seeing with producer activity between the two basins in the Permian?
Matt Meloy : Yeah. I mean we see growth in the Delaware, but we see significant growth in the Midland as well. So we see growth across both of our footprints, really active producers in both. So on our footprint, we see growth in the Midland and we see growth in the Delaware.
Neel Mitra : Okay, thank you. 
Matt Meloy : Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. 
Keith Stanley : Hi, good morning. One follow-up on Daytona just thinking to next year, 2025. Do you expect volumes on Daytona to simply tie to Targa G&P volumes? Or are there material third-party volumes that you're expecting to pick up when the pipeline comes into service?
Scott Pryor : Hi, Keith, this is Scott. I would say it's predominantly driven by our G&P footprint as to what we'll be feeding into Daytona. So it is a combination, but I would say the largest proportionate share of that is going to be related to our G&P and the additive of the plants that we've already announced and any potential plants going forward.
Keith Stanley : Got it. Thanks. And then, Jen, wanted to clarify on the cash taxes. So expectation, I think you said full 15% AMT cash tax rate in '26 and then statutory 21% tax rate in 2027. And then relatedly, how would that house pass legislation, which brings back bonus depreciation potentially impact that outlook?
Jen Kneale : We are pretty borderline right now, whether we would be subject to the AMT in 2026 or 2027. It's actually pretty close. So that -- we're trying to give you a conservative look right now that -- based on our latest forecast we may be subject to the AMT. And then in that scenario, in 2027, we'll have worked our way through our net operating losses and would be fully subject to the statutory tax rate. To the extent the existing bill that -- moving its way through gets passed, and we do see a return of accelerated bonus depreciation, that would be a big help to us. And that may delay things, call it, a year or so based on current forecast. Ultimately, we'd have to see what the final policy is that gets passed, but that would be our early read right now.
Keith Stanley : Thank you.
Jen Kneale : Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. 
John Mackay : Hey, thanks for the time. I wanted to go back to the potential export expansions. Maybe this is one for Scott. I appreciate the color. But I guess when you guys are looking high-level, top-down from a strategy standpoint, if we think about the quantity of NGLs coming off your Permian processing footprint and how much of that on a percentage basis moves its way on to the export side, do you want to be able to hold that percentage going forward? Are you comfortable with that percentage dropping? Do you want to increase it? Just any kind of directional strategy thought would be interesting.
Matt Meloy : Yeah. Sure. Yeah. As we think about really from G&P all the way through our dock, we want to make sure we have the capacity to handle the volumes coming from our G&P footprint. And so that's kind of how we think about staging transportation, fractionation. And that goes for export as well. We want to make sure we have a good market for propane and butanes. As Scott mentioned, that's really what we export. So with the expansion that just came on and the nighttime allowance of kind of, call it, 5% to 10%, I think that gives us some cushion as we go forward. And as we see really how much capacity that nighttime opens up for us, that gives us some good cushion before we're going to need another export project. But we are already looking at scoping. And so the timing is kind of to be determined, but do we need refrigeration, do we need a pipeline, are we looking at dock. But those projects are not the really large-scale, I'd say, greenfields or brownfield. I kind of view those as more debottlenecking. You have one pinch point, you spend a couple of hundred million dollars and you get some excess capacity, then you do the next and then you do the next.  So those are the things we're kind of looking at over the longer term. But yeah, we want to make sure we can handle the volumes coming across our system.
John Mackay : That's clear. Thank you. Maybe just one last quick one. You mentioned you'd caught up on the compression side. Obviously, we've been hearing about tightness in the compression market across the board. One of your peers talked about this as being a potential relative guardian on growth even going forward from here in the Permian. Maybe just your high level thoughts and whether that actually is a bit of a constraint at this point or it's gotten better versus third quarter.
Matt Meloy : Yeah. I mean we have the issues we talked about last year was really just kind of being behind on our -- getting the compression all said and getting that done last year. We had a lot of compression come on late last year, and then you saw our volumes in Q4 really move up. We have another talked about $400 million of compression. So we ordered that out about a year right now for compressors. So we tried to get ahead of it as we saw we were getting behind last year. We just approved another AFE the other day to order some more inventory to try and get ahead of it and stay for 2025.  So part of that does depend on volume growth. When you see a lot of volumes, if it exceeds our forecast, you can end up having some pinch points. But we're trying to be smart, look at the forecast and stay ahead of it.
Pat McDonie : Yeah. And I think the only thing I'd add, Matt, is lead times have not come down. The lead times are still long. So that problem still exists. We've just gotten out in front of it.
John Mackay : If I could just ask one follow-up on that. Caterpillar announced a capacity expansion on their large engine line, I guess, a week or two ago. Any initial read on whether that should bring that down from a year to something a little better?
Matt Meloy : I have not heard any change in lead times.
John Mackay : Fair enough, thank you. Appreciate the time. 
Matt Meloy : Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Michael Blum : Thanks for squeezing me in. Just wanted to ask if any update on the Apex Permian gas pipeline? And I'm assuming the $1.7 billion run-rate does not contemplate that project.
Bobby Muraro : This is Bobby. We continue to work on all the options to get gas out of the basin, which includes Apex. We've said it before and we'll say it again, our number one priority is that gas continues to flow out of the basin so that NGLs can come out of our plants and go down Grand Prix and go across our docks. Last call, I think I talked about the fact that several other projects that fit the parameters that we would want to -- back have raised their heads. And we're working hard on those along with Apex and everything else. So I am -- every month that passes, I get more encouraged by the work we're doing to make sure that a pipe gets built and comes online '26-ish. And I'm confident that something will get done this year, whether that's an Apex or one of the multiple options that we're looking at to increase egress out of the basin. 
Matt Meloy : Yeah. No. And then, Michael, on the CapEx part, that is not included in the 1.4. In any project that goes, we'll evaluate does it make sense for us to be a partner. So for a partner in it that would increase that CapEx. There's also some of these pipes that will be project financed for the majority of the capital. So any amount of equity we were to put into it would be relatively small, so it may or may not be project financed. But that is not included in the -- in our outlook.
Jen Kneale : And I'd just add one last point that in the $1.7 billion, we have been spending some capital in the last couple of years on what I call intra-basin Permian residue just to ensure we've got really good redundancy on the residue side between our plants. So to the extent that we're contemplating any of that in the future, that will be included in that $1.7 billion multiyear outlook, but no major projects.
Michael Blum : Okay. Got it. No, that helps. And then just on Frac 11 that I guess you're starting to spend a little bit on this year, what's the timing of when that would be in service? Thanks. 
Scott Pryor : Yeah. Hey, Michael, this is Scott. We've not defined what the timing would be for that in-service date. Ordering long lead items gives us some flexibility on what that needs to be out into the future. We're just finding that supply chain planning -- or supply chain issues are creating some issues with certain equipment. And so as a result of that, we can take some small capital dollars to ensure that we can hold whatever date we put out there in the future. So we don't have a defined date at this point, but it's certainly something that we want to keep on our radar and keep ahead of.
Michael Blum : Thank you. 
Matt Meloy : Yeah, thanks, Michael.

And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay and good morning. We are very proud of the efforts of our employees across the third quarter. While battling an extended stretch of hot weather, we continued to operate at a high level, demonstrated by record NGL pipeline transportation volumes, 6% higher sequential adjusted EBITDA and completion of our expansion at our LPG export facility in Galena Park, increasing our propane loading capacity by an incremental one million barrels per month. We also continue to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders in the quarter with 132 million of common share repurchases. Since the end of the third quarter, positive momentum continues across our organization highlighted by the commencement of operations, of our new Greenwood plant in Permian Midland ahead of schedule and on budget. The expected rebound in our Permian volumes with current reported inlet about 150 million cubic feet per day higher than our third quarter average, publishing our annual sustainability report, demonstrating our continued progress across ESG pillars as an operator of critical natural gas and NGL infrastructure, receiving a two-notch upgrade in our ESG rating from MSCI to AA and the announcement today that we expect to recommend to our board, an increase to the 2024 annual common dividend to $3 per share, a 50% increase over the 2023 dividend level. The strength of our operational and financial outlook has resulted in consistent questions from investors and potential investors around how Targa will return additional capital to shareholders going forward, which is why, we wanted to provide some clarity today around our expectations for our 2024 common dividend and our current thoughts around our return of capital framework. We believe that we offer a unique value proposition for investors given the strength of our outlook for annual increases in adjusted EBITDA reflective of an excellent integrated asset footprint that will continue to provide high return organic investment opportunities, increasing fee-based margin and cash flow stability from our continued progress around fee floor contracts in our G&P business, a strong credit and ESG ratings profile, demonstrating our commitment to a stable balance sheet and sustainable operations, continued opportunistic share repurchases further reducing our share count, a competitive common dividend with an expectation of meaningful best-in-class annual growth looking forward. And an outlook of significantly increasing free cash flow as some of our large fractionation and NGL transportation projects come online in 2024 and early 2025. Our return of capital strategy is informed by a lot of internal and external information including leverage and balance sheet flexibility, along with our positioning relative to our midstream peers S&P Energy and broader S&P 500. Across our base scenarios we are modelling the ability to return 40% to 50% of adjusted cash flow from operations to equity holders. This is not a target or a bright line as we place a high priority on flexibility, but it is a framework that we believe can be helpful in thinking through our return of capital -- our return of capital proposition going forward. Let's now discuss our operations in more detail. Starting in the Permian, high activity levels continue across our dedicated acreage despite lower-than-expected third quarter volumes largely driven by the extended periods of heat across New Mexico and Texas. We also had about 200 million cubic feet per day of lower-margin high-pressure volumes move off our system in the Delaware Basin. Our Permian Midland volumes increased 2% sequentially and were offset by reduced Permian Delaware volumes resulting in flat Permian inlet volumes. Through the first three quarters of this year average reported inlet volumes across our system have increased over 300 million cubic feet per day in comparison to average fourth quarter 2022. Our Permian volumes are currently operating at about 150 million cubic feet per day higher than our third quarter average, as the growth we expected to see a bit earlier in the year is now materializing in the fourth quarter. In Permian Midland our new 275 million a day Greenwood plant commenced operations in October and is quickly ramping up, a big thank you to our engineering and operations team for bringing Greenwood online safely ahead of schedule and on budget despite challenging operating conditions this past summer. Our next plant in the Midland, Greenwood II remains on track to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2024 and is expected to be much needed when it comes online. In Permian Delaware activity and volumes across our footprint are also running strong. Our Wildcat II and Roadrunner II plants remain on track to begin operations in the first and second quarters of 2024 respectively and both plants are expected to be much needed at start-up. In our Central region and the Badlands our combined Natural Gas volumes increased 2% sequentially and our systems are performing well. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment Targa's NGL pipeline transportation volumes were a record 660,000 barrels per day and fractionation volumes remained strong averaging 793,000 barrels per day during the third quarter. Our Grand Prix NGL pipeline deliveries into Mont Belvieu increased 6% sequentially as we benefited from higher third-party supply volumes. Our fractionation complex in Mont Belvieu continues to operate near capacity. The restart of GCF will provide much needed capacity when it is fully restarted late in the first quarter of 2024 and we continue to expect our Train nine fractionator to be highly utilized when it commences operations during the second quarter of 2024. Our Train 10 fractionator is also expected to be much needed given the anticipated growth in our G&P business and corresponding plant additions and remains on track for the first quarter of 2025. In our LPG export business at Galena Park, our loadings increased 15% sequentially due to improved market conditions. We loaded an average of 10.7 million barrels per month of LPGs during the third quarter even though our loading capability was reduced for part of the quarter, due to a previously disclosed required 10-year inspection. Our low-cost expansion project to increase our propane loading capabilities by an incremental one million barrels per month of capacity was completed at the end of the third quarter and we expect our loadings to ramp during the fourth quarter providing strong momentum for 2024. We are excited about the long-term outlook at Targa and remain focused on continuing to execute on our strategic priorities.  Before I turn the call over to Jen, to discuss our third quarter results in more detail I would like to extend a thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution while continuing to provide best-in-class service and reliability to our customers.
Jen Kneale: Thanks Matt. Good morning everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $840 million a 6% increase over the second quarter. Sequential increase was attributable to higher system volumes across our integrated NGL businesses higher commodity prices partially offset by higher operating and G&A expenses. With three quarters of the year completed, we are tracking towards the lower end of our 2023 adjusted EBITDA range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, but believe that our performance through a lower commodity price environment and a tough operating environment relative to our guidance assumptions is reflective of the significant progress that we have made adding fee floors to our G&P business, our successful hedging program and the resiliency of our operations. For a good part of this year, we have benefited from margin associated with fee floor contracts as natural gas and NGL prices were below fee floor levels. We believe that 2023 provides an example of the financial durability of our business in a lower commodity price environment and the benefits of the fee floor structure where we retain upside if commodity prices move higher. We are well hedged across all commodities for the balance of the year and continue to add hedges for 2024 and beyond. Through three quarters we have spent approximately $1.6 million on growth capital projects and our current estimates for balance of year spending lead us towards the higher end of our $2 billion to $2.2 billion range. Our net maintenance capital spending is tracking a little bit higher than initial expectations and our current estimate for 2023 is approximately $200 million. At the end of the third quarter, we had $1.8 billion of available liquidity and our pro forma net leverage ratio is approximately 3.7 times, well within our long-term leverage ratio target range of three to four times. Shifting to capital allocation. Our priorities remain the same, which are to maintain a strong investment grade balance sheet to continue to invest in high-returning integrated projects and to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles. Our major projects in progress are core to our business. For new Permian gas processing plants, Train 9 and Train 10 fractionators and our Daytona NGL pipeline, and while we continue to project 2024 growth capital spend to approximate spending levels similar to 2023, spending in 2025 is expected to be meaningfully lower as we will have completed the lumpier expansions in our downstream business. As Matt described underpinned by the strength of our business outlook for 2024 and beyond, we plan to recommend to our Board a 50% increase to the 2024 annual common dividend to $3 per share and we expect to be able to grow the annual common dividend meaningfully thereafter. We also expect to remain in a position to continue to execute opportunistically under our common share repurchase program. During the third quarter, we repurchased $132 million of common shares at a weighted average price of $83.38 and have repurchased $333 million year-to-date through September. We had about $811 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase program at the end of the third quarter. We remain excited about the long-term outlook at Targa. Our talented team continues to execute on our strategic priorities and safely operate our assets to deliver the energy that enhances our everyday lives. And with that I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks Jen. For the Q&A session, we kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up and reenter the lineup if you have additional questions. Brittney, would you please open the line for Q&A?
Operator: Yes, thank you. At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Theresa Chen: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. It's great to see a very strong dividend increase in your new capital return framework, really a capital accountability framework if anything. Can you talk about your view of dividend growth within all this, how did you arrive at the 50% increase over 2023? Is there a yield you would like to achieve? And how you generally plan to balance dividend growth with share repurchases within that new 50% cash from ops framework while maintaining a healthy balance sheet?
Jen Kneale: Good morning, Theresa, this is Jen. As we said in our scripted remarks, the most consistent question that we've gotten from investors and especially potential investors is related to how we intend to return capital to our investors. And we believe that we've got a really strong story there when we think about where we are today and where we are going forward. Clearly this morning, you can see that we've got significant conviction in the underlying strength of our business as evidenced by our continued activity under our share repurchase program. Our return on capital strategy begins with numerous multiyear scenarios, and hopefully it's becoming more evident that increasing G&P fees and fee floors, are really positioning us to be able to invest in the business to support the activities of our upstream producers despite a lower Waha and NGL environment which are meaningful to us while also increasing our cash flow stability and resiliency across lower commodity price environments. So as we look out across multiple years, we've got the flexibility to return an increasing amount of our adjusted cash flow from operations to shareholders. And that's where we're saying that we think we're in position over multi years to return call it 40% to 50% of CFFO. It's not a bright line as we certainly continue to balance and really prioritize balance sheet strength and flexibility. But I do think it's part of how we're thinking about the world and it's important for us to provide a little bit more transparency around how Targa and our Board of Directors look at the dividend. Beyond that we start to look at our peers broader S&P Energy and S&P 500 and how they're returning capital and then Targa's relative positioning across all of that. And all of that is really at the end of the day informing a return of capital strategy that we believe can maximize shareholder value. We've been very transparent since we instituted the program in October of 2020 that we want to have an opportunistic share repurchase program. And hopefully we are demonstrating a track record of activity when given that opportunity. As we look forward and move through time. We'll have to see what the opportunities present themselves in the market and that will ultimately balance the approach to dividends and repurchases. But I think this is an important indication that clearly we are in a position to return more capital to shareholders. And can do that through a stable and meaningfully growing dividend and then also can continue to supplement that with opportunistic repurchases. It continues to be that all of the above approach, but I think you're really seeing us execute on.
Theresa Chen: Thank you. And on the topic of the continued volume growth, just with the recent announcements of upstream consolidation in the Permian, especially the news related to your Midland JV partner and anchor shipper. What do you think this all means for Targa in terms of volume growth trajectory and the duration of the resource underlying your acreage?
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure. Hi Theresa, this is Matt. With the announcements we've seen recently, they are consistent with the previous announcements, we have really good relationships with the parties involved in those transactions. So whether you're talking about Exxon or Chevron or others, we have good relationships and really growing relationships with them. We handle a lot of their volumes today. And as we think about it at least in the short-term, we have contracts in place with all those parties mentioned. And so those contracts are typically long-term contracts. So we'll just have to see how it plays out over time. We think the outlook for growth in the Permian Basin continues to be very strong. When you look at some of those parties mentioned they have pretty robust growth outlook. So I think over the longer term, I think we're optimistic on what it ultimately means for our underlying business. But we'll just have to kind of see how that plays out. I think it's going to play out over time.
Theresa Chen: Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you so much. One moment for our next question please. All right. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Michael Blum: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to just ask about your views now on the trajectory of Permian volume growth. I just wanted to understand that the third quarter, would you say these were just really temporary operational issues? Are you seeing any real material change in producer activity which would drive a change in the slope of future growth?
Matt Meloy: Yes. Hey, Michael. Yes, good question. We're seeing strong growth from the Permian. So talking about Midland first and then will get on Delaware. Really the Midland volumes are tracking in line with our guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year. Continued strong growth is really on track and we've seen that even ramp here in the fourth quarter. So it really kind of comes into the Delaware. We did have 200 million a day kind of roll off in between Q2 and Q3 when you kind of look at the averages. Now that was -- we knew that was going to happen so that was factored in to our guidance. But that just does illustrate we had underlying growth in the third quarter. But it's not quite enough to offset the $200 million that was rolling off. We're seeing a lot of activity in the Delaware. We've got a lot of compression that we're adding frankly it's coming in a little bit later than we had thought we were going to have it in place at the beginning of the year. We've got 200 million a day scheduled to come online between now and year-end. So, it's just coming in a little bit later but the volumes are there. We're frankly still a little bit behind and trying to catch up and be there to handle all the volumes. But the underlying outlook I think we're very confident that Permian volumes are going to continue to grow both in the Midland side and on the Delaware side not just for Q4, but as you look out 2024, 2025, and beyond.
Michael Blum: Great. No, that's perfect. And then that actually just ties into my second question which is as I'm sure you're aware you and many others have announced NGL pipeline takeaway expansions. And so it's clearly getting pretty competitive. So, just wondering how should we think about your contracted position in that market? You obviously had the 200 roll off this quarter. Is there any other major roll-offs to flag in the future? And just in general how are you thinking about your contracted position.
Scott Pryor: And specifically to the Grand Prix pipeline Michael?
Michael Blum: Yes.
Scott Pryor: Okay. This is Scott. Sorry I just wanted to clarify. When we look the quarter -- the third quarter, we had some volume improvements that came across in the quarter. Those were predominantly third-party volumes. Our upstream volumes as Matt indicated we're relatively flat on the quarter. But we continue to see volume growth overall. As we look into 2024 and really in the fourth quarter and into 2024, we would expect those volumes to continue both from our upstream growth as well as some third-party volumes that will roll on to us as contracts mature into their in the beginning. With Daytona pipeline coming online in the fourth quarter of next year we feel very comfortable with the timing of that relative to the volume growth that we will have and we've seen a number of announcements in the marketplace obviously off late. But the operating leverage that we get with Daytona coming online for our West leg the operating leverage we have on our pipeline moving into Mont Belvieu gives us a lot of runway. That runway will allow us to basically evaluate what it looks like with our volume growth whether or not there's opportunities to move on other people's pipes as our volumes grow. So, we've got a lot of time to evaluate what that looks like over time.
Michael Blum: Great. Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Thanks Michael.
Operator: Thank you so much. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Reynolds with UBS. Your line is now open.
Matt Meloy: Hey Brian.
Sanjay Lad: We can't hear anything. I don't know if anyone else can.
Operator: Hello Mr. Reynolds?
Sanjay Lad: Brittney would you go ahead and to the next person in the Q&A please?
Operator: Yes, we will. Our next line comes -- I'm sorry our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis with Citi. Your line is now open.
Spiro Dounis: Thanks operator. Good morning guys. Maybe just going back to maybe coming back to NGL pipeline volumes quickly. You guys hit record levels this quarter third-party volumes are coming on to the system. But still a lot of time before Daytona comes online. So, just to between now and Daytona any chance you guys could be offloading volumes? Do you feel like you're pretty secure on that front?
Scott Pryor: Spiro, this is Scott again. We feel comfortable. I would say that from time to time where we've seen maintenance on the pipeline or managing the start-up of our pump stations along Grand Prix on the West side as well as on the south side. We have from time to time taking the availability of industry capacity where necessary to offload. But with the start-up of pump stations those getting fully energized that gives us a long runway going into 2024. We'll certainly, evaluate what that looks like, but we feel comfortable that with the timing of the ramp-up of the volumes how we can facilitate offloads where it may be necessary that we'll look forward to Daytona coming online in the fourth quarter of next year.
Matt Meloy: And just to add to that too of the 660 that we moved barrels per day, most of that is from the Permian but there's still a significant amount of that is coming in from the North -- like kind of from the North Texas, Oklahoma segment. We can move call it up to when all the pump stations get on 650-ish maybe low 600s in terms of barrels per day from the West leg. So, we still have some running room between now and when Daytona comes on.
Spiro Dounis: Okay. Yes. So, thanks Matt. That's helpful color. And switching gears a bit to [indiscernible] seems like a real bright spot once again with the ARB open. Just wonder, if you can just give us a sense of what that looks like today for you guys. You're passing inspection now. You've got the new capacity online. I imagine that's going pretty well.
Scott Pryor: Yes. Our volumes in the third quarter certainly benefited from increased demand and improved spot opportunities. We were very pleased, with the quarter-to-quarter volume improvement that we saw despite obviously, having to work around the planned outage for required inspections and the completion of our export expansion project. Now, with that expansion project online, we are already seeing benefits of that and we'd expect to see that end in through the fourth quarter. So our volumes in the fourth quarter, we would expect them to be equal to or better than what we saw in the third quarter as the ARB opportunities have improved. First and foremost, we're going to make sure that we're performing for our term contracts and taking advantage of spot opportunities that we can squeeze into our lineup relative to the schedule as we optimize around the facility. We are still learning quite frankly, what the full capabilities will be of this expansion and we will continue to look for ways to optimize in and around that moving forward through the fourth quarter and into 2024.
Spiro Dounis: Helpful color. I’ll leave it there. Thanks, team.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you so much. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Q – Keith Stanley: Hi. Good morning. First, -- Hi Matt. Just are any of the -- I want to make sure any of the constraint issues you saw in Q3 expected to have a sustained impact going forward? Or do you view this as a onetime event and we should see a good bounce back in Q4. I just want to make sure there's an expectation that, this was kind of a onetime thing and there's no lingering kind of issues that could pop-up in future quarters?
Matt Meloy: And I guess, are you referring to the volumes in the G&P side on the Delaware or?
Q – Keith Stanley: Yes, that's, right. Just G&P volumes and what you referred to in the quarter.
Matt Meloy: It's I think part of it goes back to when we made the acquisition last year of Lucid, there was a lot of growth on the system. And we were immediately, offloading a lot of volumes on to Targa. And frankly, it was just kind of behind out in the field laying pipelines and getting compression and it's about a year, wait time to get more compression. So we were frankly, just a little bit more behind than we want it to be and those volumes are coming in a little bit later in the year. I don't want to make it sound like come 30 days everything is fixed. We're adding a lot of compression, but we're going to be adding a lot of compression next year too. So we are trying to handle and resolve the pressure issues that we're seeing out in the Delaware, out in the field. We're going to be adding a lot of compression not only in this quarter, but next quarter and throughout next year. So part of that was exacerbated because of the heat and operational issues and upsets that we had. So, we're really trying to address and kind of get ahead of where the producers are going. So Pat, anything you want to add to that?
Pat McDonie: Well, I think we showed the level of confidence in what we think our volume is going to be. We've got two plants under construction, in the process of clearing a third plant site. And we're not building because, we don't think the volume growth is there certainly through the producer discussions that we have and what we're seeing getting done and as Matt alluded to, we're behind getting compression in place, et cetera. Some of the producers lag a few weeks, there's equipment delays, et cetera. So I would look at the third quarter's anomaly. Certainly, when you walk into a winter you don't know what weather expectations and what impact that has on production. But I think the key answer there is the underlying business is solid. The activity levels are high and we have a lot of confidence as indicated by what we're investing in the Delaware for future volume growth.
KeithStanley: That's helpful. Second I just want to clarify the capital return framework. So 40% to 50% of operating cash flow to equity holders, which could be buybacks and dividends. It sounds like the frameworks effectively allows the company to meet its growth objectives and still keep you in that leverage target of three to four times overall. I'm asking just because it seems -- it just feels like a pretty big step change. You have this 50% dividend hike and 40% to 50% would also imply a pretty big step-up in buybacks as well. So just want to make sure I'm understanding that right.
Jen Kneale : Keith, this is Jen. I think what we're trying to do is just provide some visibility into some of the target specific metrics that we look at. If you look at our LTM return of capital as a percent of cash flow from operations here over the last 12 months, you'll see that we're lower than peers lower than the S&P 500 lower than the S&P Energy average. And so part of this is indicating we've had really strong total return performance and believe that we will have strong total return performance going forward, which is really based on the value proposition that we think we provide, significant EBITDA growth continued ability to return and high return organic growth capital projects. And because of that and having a strong balance sheet the ability to also return more capital to shareholders. So one of the big questions we get is, well, how much more and what does that look like and how are you thinking about it? And that's why we're really trying to articulate that this isn't a bright line and this isn't a we must. It's really just instructive as we look out over our multiyear forecast across a number of different scenarios. That's one of the important elements or quantitative metrics that we are looking at. And I think as we think about a multiyear framework so 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 five-year planning horizon we look across those multiple years and believe that it's reasonable to say that we will have the business that could support returning that much capital to shareholders and ultimately we've made one decision that we've announced today which says this is our expectation that we'll recommend dividend to our Board for approval effective the first quarter of 2024, and then we'll continue to evaluate. But it is one of the important metrics that I think we are looking at to inform how we believe we can return capital over multiple years.
Keith Stanley: Got it. Thank you.
Jen Kneale : Thank you.
Matt Meloy : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you so much. One moment for our next question please. Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank. Your line is now open.
Tristan Richardson : Hey, good morning guys. I may have missed it in the prepared remarks, but can you talk about any updates you're seeing broadly in the market on the gas solutions side maybe how that market has evolved since you first planted a flag with your potential solution? And then maybe any updates on commercial development of your specific project?
Bobby Muraro : Hi. This is Bobby. So what I'd tell you is the message around APEX and the effort on APEX and residue solutions for the Permian Basin does not change for Targa. Our priority is to make sure that solutions for the Basin get built. We've talked about a solution needed in the 2026-ish time frame, which is why we have been pushing at APEX. And I'd say, why we've been pushing APEX. It's really been a group of investment-grade counterparties shippers and markets that has driven the design of that. But what I'd tell you is that some of the changes, which are positive is there, I think are multiple options that have started to come to fruition maybe be too strong of a word, but opportunities for other solutions. And at the end of the day, Targa has one priority and that's to make sure that the gas gets out of the basin. So whether it ends up being APEX or another pipe and whether we -- they need our help to back another pipe or not that's where we'll be is to make sure that pipe gets built or APEX get built or something gets built for the 2026 time frame. Again, if APEX goes it will be, because it's in a framework that works for us and works for the counterparties that are out there. But if APEX doesn't go we stand ready to make sure another solution goes in 2026 and that the Basin has that takeaway such that gas can continue to flow in our plants and NGLs down our integrated system.
Tristan Richardson: Appreciate that context, Bobby. And then I know we've just now gotten the export expansion online. But as we think about Daytona and third-party volumes coming into the frac, do you see the export market starting to tighten up? And then does your capacity today really allow for headroom assuming a reasonable utilization of Daytona once we've been ramping on that asset late in 2024 and into 2025.
Scott Pryor: Hi, Tristan. This is Scott. Yes, I would say that today the market feels tight. We were very pleased with the timing of our most recent export expansion coming online because we are seeing benefits. And again as I stated earlier we will continue to look for ways to optimize around that capacity and better ways to facilitate movements across the dog. So we're very pleased with that being online. With that said, as we look to as we look at further expansions at our facility, we continuously explore opportunities in the form of small projects or debottlenecking projects at our Galena Park facility that will provide meaningful capacity improvements while being capital efficient. We are very fortunate to have an existing facility today that we have a lot of runway to add projects to that are very capital efficient that will provide us capabilities moving forward. So we'll continue to watch the volume growth in and through our system and we'll time those various projects accordingly. But again we're very fortunate to already have an existing facility that we can kind of bolt on to very effectively.
Tristan Richardson: Appreciate it, Scott. Thank you, guys and congrats on the capital allocation plan.
Scott Pryor: Okay. Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Thank you.
Operator: All right. Thank you so much. Please standby for our next question everyone. Our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra or Mitra -- I apologize, with Bank of America. Your line is now open. 
Neel Mitra: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Matt, I think, you alluded to 200 million cubic feet rolling off in the New Mexico, Delaware. I know there's another probably smaller contract roll off in 2024. Can you speak to the dynamics in that area just because it's so competitive are competitors kind of undercutting you on price to try to win some acreage dedications? Or is kind of the Red Hills complex just so big that some producers want to diversify away and have a few players versus a very big concentrated player in the area?
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure. Good question. Let me just clarify. I think I did say roll off. It's really contracted volumes that we have coming to us that it was really contracted for it to move. And we're not losing to third-party midstream. That's not where that went. So Bobby do you want to?
Bobby Muraro: Yes, this is Bobby. For clarity a producer own plant came online and that 200 million a day move to that producer own plan. And when that plant goes up we get more debt. So it's part of our planning all along. And it's -- contracts didn't change, contracts didn't expire, contracts didn't roll off producer plant that takes no third-party gas came online.
Matt Meloy: And so -- and the reason we're highlighting the 200 million is just because we were down 75 million quarter-to-quarter. So there was an underlying 125 million of growth from the quarter kind of why we see strength. We see growth in that business. It was just contractually as Bobby said it moved off the system.
Pat McDonie: And frankly we're backfilling high-pressure low-margin gas with low-pressure higher-margin gas which is kind of what our bread and butter, right?
Neel Mitra: Yes. Perfect. And then maybe just a follow-up on potential Apex opportunities. Could you maybe book end the spend you would look at just in terms of 2025 being a lower CapEx year than 2024. And kind of the maximum you would be willing to undertake in that investment for Apex if needed would you be the operator, would you take a small equity interest? How would you go about looking about that to keep the capital down?
Matt Meloy: Yeah, sure. I'll -- let me kind of start here and then if others want to jump in. Yeah, I think Apex or I'd say the next pipe out of the Permian is going to likely be a joint venture between either multiple midstreams, midstream and producers. So there will be a partial ownership so if we participate in something we could have an ownership interest in the JV or we could move volumes on it, and frankly not have an ownership interest if it gets a pipe done. So I'd say, the book-end and the low end, if we could be putting no capital into the next pipeline. I think we'd like to have our options open where we could have an ownership interest. We've seen that that creates value for Targa. GCX is a good example. We own 25% we invested in it and then ultimately monetize it. So I think we're trying to be open to opportunities like that that give us the ability to invest in that project and whether we end up holding it, whether we operate it, what percentage level, those are all discussions and it depends on which pipe ends up going whether it is Apex or it is another pipe led by someone else. As Bobby said, our primary focus is getting a pipe build where our ownership is, and what -- and how we would finance that, if we project finance it, it would be very little capital out the door right? So we have all those options to us. I think as we look forward on our capital spend as Jen has mentioned in the past is, we see 2024 in being kind of in a similar area and we see 2025 spending coming down. I think the trajectory of our capital should be kind of down once we get past 2024, and we'll look to kind of optimize how much spending and how that all works in that framework.
Neel Mitra: Okay. Perfect. Thanks for the answer.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you so much. Please standby for our next question. All right. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan Securities LLC. Your line is now open.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.
Matt Meloy: Hey, good morning, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: So with the caveat upfront granted you're not giving 2024 guidance here and you've talked about a number of moving pieces talked about, I think some volume trends and maybe the LPG outlook. But just wondering, if there's any other big moving pieces that we should think about when we're shaping our 2024 thoughts from where we sit. And maybe just at a high level how you see Targa's EBITDA growth being able to trend organically from where you are -- would Targa largely track kind of Permian growth trends in general? Or are there other kind of pieces to the puzzle we should think about?
Matt Meloy: Hey, Jeremy good question. As we look out into 2024, I think we're optimistic that not only 2024 is going to be -- have good EBITDA growth of 2025 and beyond. And it's really just kind of the timing as you mentioned what's that shaping going to look like. I think, it does for us start in the Permian G&P business. What volumes are moving through both the Delaware and the Midland that's going to provide the more volumes into NGL transport fractionation and available for export. So, I think, it's kind of starts with what is overall Permian look like. And I think we see a pretty strong outlook for 2024, 2025 and really five-plus years, I'd say 5 to 10 years and even longer on the gas side. So I think short term it looks good and longer term it looks good. I'd say the only other thing to think about is we do have a lot of fractionation coming on in 2024. We have GCF coming on at the end of the quarter. We'll have Train 9 and then Train 10. So that's an outsized amount of fractionation relative to just kind of normal volume growth that we're seeing. We have the export expansion just done. I think we're set up well for exports in 2024. But ultimately, it kind of comes back to Permian gathering and processing growth will be the primary driver.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That makes sense there. And you talked about upstream consolidation earlier in the call and just want to shift the focus towards midstream. We have seen a bit of an uptick in consolidation in the industry. And just wondering, from where Targa sits right now do you feel comfortable with, I guess, how the business is right now? Or do you see -- how do you see Targa's rule I guess in industry consolidation going forward at this point?
Matt Meloy: Yeah, sure. I'd say where -- I think we said is our internal business prospects look very good. We have a very good case just to continue to operate in our core business. Gathering and Processing in the Permian largest G&P footprint in the Permian Basin is going to afford us multiple years of growth. So I think we just sit in a very fortunate position to just focus on Targa. We're going to invest in G&P. We're going to invest in transport like we are with Daytona, invest in fractionation. We're being in three fractionators on and continue to invest in export. So in terms of us looking at bolt-ons or tack-ons, I think that's really kind of far down our capital priority list. I think we want to execute on the organic growth projects we have in front of us and then increase and then distribute an increasing amount of that to our shareholders as Jen talked about and up 40% to 50% over time. It's not in any one exact year, but we see being able to do all of those things distribute 40% to 50% lower our leverage invest in our business. So I think we're focused on Targa right now and just executing our plan in front of us.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Makes sense. That’s helpful. I’ll leave it there.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: All right. Thank you so much. One moment for our next question please. Our next question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global. Your line is now open.
Sunil Sibal: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking my question. So my first question related to some of the operational issues et cetera in the third quarter that you talked about. In addition to I think the weather and compression some of the operators have also talked about higher CO2 concentration in the gas streams. I believe that's an issue Targa is pretty familiar with. So I was curious, how do you handle that going forward? And also, does it kind of accelerate your CO2 sequestration solution?
Pat McDonie: This is Pat. CO2 wasn't really a major contributor to operational issues for us in the third quarter. We have a lot of capabilities and are adding capabilities to handle CO2 and frankly H2S sour gas. We do see CO2 production growing in the Delaware Basin specifically. There are a lot of producers that do things at the wellhead that are capital inefficient and expensive for them to do. So as we move forward, we are putting infrastructure in place that allows us to handle handling high CO2 volumes, sequestering CO2, dealing with sour gas H2S and other components, but as far as the operational issues I mean, you hit it. It's weather a little late on compression, residue gas pipeline issues which is more felt in the Delaware because we don't quite have the system fungibility in the Delaware that we do in Midland. We're building that infrastructure, as you can see from our capital spend. We've gotten a lot of benefit from integrating our Northern Delaware or Lucid system with our other two Delaware systems. But over time, when we have issues on specific plant sites and/or compressor sites will have that fungibility where we can move gas around and keep production flowing. It's a little more exacerbated right now. And as we move forward that will get better. So that's kind of where we're at right now and it looks better forward.
Bobby Muraro: And then this is Bobby. On the CO2 sequestration side, we've been pushing a bunch of projects forward. I think people have seen public filings relative to MRP plans that are already in place and wells that we have permitted out there. And that continues to move forward. That -- those businesses are not predicated on an increasing amount of CO2 being in the stream. But to your point and/or question, if the concentrations do come up over time, that would be additive to the CO2 business. We expect to start getting 45Q this coming year. And again, over time composition starts to go up in the CO2 stream and we've already got those assets and wells and injection capability in place that will just up the 45Q credits and profitability of that business that were put together.
Sunil Sibal: Okay. Thanks for that. And then on the capital allocation front, thanks for providing that clarity. I was just curious now that you put some guardrails around that does that impact also your targeted returns on investments? I know previously we talked about 5x to 7x kind of multiples. Does that range change in any way with the guardrails that you're putting around?
Jen Kneale: I think that we have a lot of organic growth capital investment opportunities at higher returns as we look out across our footprint. That's part of why the fee floor structure has been so important allowing us to continue to invest to support our producers' activities even in lower and across lower commodity price environment. So as we look forward, I wouldn't say that, anything that we've described today around return of capital is changing how we think about investments or investment opportunities. We've described it as a multiyear approach, where we believe we can distribute call it 40% to 50% of cash flow from operations. But ultimately, we'll be assessing everything across the business including balance sheet, stability, organic growth opportunities, everything that is involved in a Targa forecast and then sensitivities of those forecasts to ultimately drive the return of capital decisions each year. But that's one of the ways that we're certainly thinking about it.
Sunil Sibal: Got it. Thanks for the time.
Matt Meloy: Thank you.
Jen Kneale: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you so much. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.
Jake Nivasch: This is Jake Nivasch on for Neal. Thanks for the question. I just had one quick one here. Just strategically, I know given how all these fee-based contracts have been ramping up for you guys over the past several years. Just at a high level, I'm just curious do you feel now that you're in a good state as a percent of your contracts being fee-based? Or should we expect a little bit more of a ramp going forward? Have you – if you can quantify that that would be great. But really just thinking strategically, where are we at with that kind of transition here. Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Yes, so this is Matt. And then Jen, if you want to add on. Yes we've made a lot of progress at adding or really having fee-based growth in both our G&P business and our downstream business but also putting in fee-based floors and components into our G&P business as contracts come up. Yes, as you look at really through this year, where we've had fee floors and those hybrid contracts we are kind of at or below the floors. So as you think about just kind of earnings power going forward, most of those are at or below. And so as we get some tailwind, if we get some tailwinds from commodity prices that would just be upside. But on those fee floor contracts there's not a lot of downside from here. So we think we're in a good spot.
Jen Kneale: And I'd just add that our commercial team has done a great job of putting ourselves in a position to continue to invest for producers by getting those fee floors in place. But ultimately, if commodity prices are higher and our percentage of fee margin is going down from our gathering and processing business because commodity prices are higher. I think that will be a huge win for us and our shareholders and that's one of the reasons that we really like the fee floor structure. Ultimately, where we'd like to get to is having fee floors and really all of our gathering and processing contracts or have them be fee-based because that combined with our fee-based downstream business just provides us with a lot more cash flow stability across commodity price environment. So ultimately, that's sort of the direction that we're heading in. And our teams have done a great job of pushing us towards that.
Jake Nivasch: Got it. Thank you. If I could just squeeze one more in and I know we've touched on this a few times but I just want to clarify something. So the compression issues that you guys have seen it sounds like things have improved – but does that mean – because things have been delayed and I know you guys mentioned, you have a good amount coming in 2024 as well. Does that mean the delays pushed back the initial 2024 orders? Or should we just expect I guess more of an acceleration or just a little bit more in 2024, given these delays here. Just trying to get clarification here.
Matt Meloy: Yes, I mean for the most part those have been ordered. Part of it was delivery delays. So I don't know that the CapEx it shifts – necessarily shift all that much. We're just really constantly kind of buying compressors and adding to inventory. So there's some flex there but it just does take some time there. And then one thing to note too, as we're kind of waiting on those compression delays, we're still coordinated for the most part with our producers such that we can capture the initial production from there. So we're working with them to make sure we're there for the IP and that we're getting that production. So it's not really lost it's just kind of deferred and pushed into other periods.
Jake Nivasch: Yeah. That's makes sense. Okay. That's it for me. Thank you, guys.
Jen Kneale: Take care.
Matt Meloy: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] All right. Our final question comes from the line of Brian Reynolds with UBS. Your line is now open.
Sanjay Lad: Good morning, Brian. We can't hear you.
Brian Reynolds: Hello. Can you hear me?
Matt Meloy: Yeah. There you go, Brian.
Sanjay Lad: Yeah. There you are. We can hear you.
Brian Reynolds: Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry about that this morning. Just a follow-up on the Permian, at this point it seems like Targa is not close to its potential full integration of GMP assets to NGL long haul at this point. So I know basically all the Midland volumes make it downstream on the Targa integrated system. But could you talk about maybe the process Delaware volumes that are -- that are not being transported on Targa downstream is it like roughly 50%? And kind of how should we think about those volumes rolling on to Targa's long-haul system on 2024 or 2025 to kind of get to that 100% number.
Matt Meloy: Yeah. Sure. I mean, I'd say we have a lot of our G&P business is pointing liquids into our downstream business. I don't know that we ever get to 100%. That's not really a goal. There's going to be some amount of volumes that are going on third-party pipes. The vast majority on the Midland side move, but it's not 100% on the Midland side. And in the Delaware, I'd say it's a majority, but because of some acquisitions and just legacy dedications onto other pipes that's going to take time. But as we grow, I'd say, a disproportionate amount of the growth is tied to target. And I think that's going to continue. So I think we have a majority out there. I see that number moving north just as you go -- as we go forward. But I think we're in a really strong position of capturing the majority of volumes across the Permian and moving those into the downstream assets.
Brian Reynolds: Great. Thanks. And as a follow-up I know you talked about CapEx a little bit but kind of curious if you could help sensitize us a little bit if we think about G&P capital three processing plants and perhaps the need for frac 11, as we look ahead of 2025 how would that look to 2024? Is it 1.5, 1.7 or something like that? And then, ultimately ethane exports is very intriguing part of the business an NGL value chain at this point seems to be getting more competitive based on announced projects. Is there an opportunity for Targa to participate as we look to the middle to end of the decade? Thanks.
Matt Meloy: Yeah. I think on CapEx we pointed to with Daytona multiple fractionation trains we see 2024 being kind of similar-ish levels which I'd characterize as kind of higher than a normal run rate levels because the downstream projects are a bit lumpier. So that's why we have some confidence as we get into 2025 and beyond potentially having urgent 2025 having it be lower and then maybe a more normalized rate thereafter. As you look at ethane exports there's, a number of expansions and parties that do that. That is something we have talked about in the past. We have the capability to do that. Right now what we're really focused on is increasing our connectivity to the domestic pet chem market and flexibility to other I'd say just other customers for ethane demand. I'd say that's -- it's out there. We don't -- I wouldn't put that on the front of our list of something we are looking at right now but that is on the potential that we kind of keep on the list.
Scott Pryor: Yeah. And I would just add Matt this is Scott. That -- again Matt alluded to the fact, we are continuously improving our deliverability out of our system to the domestic petrochemical operators in and around Mont Belvieu and the surrounding area. So that will be a primary focus as we see volume growth continue over the course of the next several years. And given the increase in ethane consumption with those petrochemical plants we believe we'll get a large proportion of that just based upon our own upstream growth and into our assets.
Brian Reynolds: Great. Thanks. Appreciate all the colour and have a excellent morning.
Sanjay Lad: Okay. Thank you.
Jen Kneale: Thanks Brian.
Operator: All right. Thank you so much for that. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to Sanjay Lad for closing remarks.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks to everyone that was on the call this morning. And we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you have. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

Matt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning. The second quarter results were consistent with our expectations as the strength of our business drove record volumes for the quarter, which really set us up well for a strong year. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially given our significant marketing gains in the first quarter but consistent with previous disclosures, we expect EBITDA to ramp over the balance of the year and we remain confident in our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA estimate of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion. During the second quarter, we had record volumes in the Permian, driving record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes downstream. We fully brought online our Legacy II Plant in Permian Midland and commenced operations on our Midway plant in Permian Delaware, and we executed on a quarterly record $149 million of common share repurchases, which is reflective of our strong conviction in the outlook for our business going forward. Natural gas volumes across our Permian systems continue to grow and the recent completion of our Legacy II and Midway Plants provide us with incremental Midland and Delaware processing capacity to handle a continued ramp in inlet volumes driving incremental volumes through our integrated NGL downstream assets. Given our increasing Permian volumes and consistent with our previous messaging that we are already ordering long lead items, today, we officially announced our next plant in the Permian Midland and our next plant in the Permian Delaware to support the infrastructure needs of our producer customers. We continue to estimate 2023 growth CapEx spending of between $2 billion and $2.2 billion and all of our previously announced projects remain on track and on budget. As we think about 2024 growth capital, we will continue to have spending to complete a number of our major projects already underway, including Frac Trains 9 and 10, the majority of capital on our Daytona NGL pipeline and five Permian gas plants driving expenditures for 2024, which may approximate spending levels similar to 2023. Growth capital spend beyond '24 is likely to come down as we will have caught up on the downstream side of the business as those major growth capital projects will be complete. Investing in organic growth projects across our core integrated footprint provides Targa with attractive returns and puts us in a strong position to continue to return incremental capital to our shareholders. Let's now discuss our operations in more detail. Starting in the Permian, high activity levels continue across our dedicated acreage. Our systems across the Midland and Delaware basins averaged of record 5.1 billion cubic feet per day of reported inlet volumes during the second quarter, increasing 5% sequentially. In Permian Midland, we continue to see strong producer activity and our system continues to operate near capacity. Capacity for our new Legacy II Plant became fully available partway through the second quarter and is currently running near full. Our next Midland plant, Greenwood remains on track to begin operations in the late fourth quarter of 2023 and is expected to be highly utilized when it comes online. In Permian Delaware, activity and volumes across our footprint are also running strong. Our Midway plant commenced operations late in the second quarter and is providing much needed incremental processing capacity. Midway became fully operational this week and we idled our Sand Hills facility. These actions will increase operational reliability and enhance plant recoveries for our customers. Our Wildcat II and Roadrunner II Plants remain on track to begin operations in the first and second quarters of 2024, respectively, and both plants are expected to start up highly utilized given the robust activity across our entire Delaware footprint. We are currently offloading an average of around 70 million cubic feet per day of gas in the Permian and are in the process of adding significant compression horsepower during the balance of the year and are continuing to see strong producer activity across our acreage, which gives us the confidence that we remain on track for our average 2023 Permian inlet gas volumes to increase 10% over the fourth quarter of 2022. In our Central region in the Badlands, our combined natural gas volumes increased 3% sequentially, and we are currently not seeing any material change in activity across our producer customers despite lower commodity prices. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. Targa's NGL pipeline transportation volumes were a record 621,000 barrels per day and fractionation volumes were a record 794,000 barrels per day during the second quarter. The ramp in supply volumes from our Permian systems and third parties drove the record sequential increase in NGL transportation. Additionally, Grand Prix pipeline volumes also benefited from the expiration of certain medium term commitments we had on third party pipes. Our fractionation facilities in Mont Belvieu remain highly utilized and the restart of GCF will provide some much needed capacity when it is fully restarted in the first quarter of 2024, and we expect to continue -- and we continue to expect our Train 9 fractionator to be highly utilized when it commences operations during the second quarter of 2024. Our recently announced Train 10 fractionator is expected to be much needed given the expected continued growth in our G&P business and plant expansions and remains on track for the first quarter of 2025. At Galena Park, we loaded an average of 9.2 million barrels per month of LPGs during the second quarter. In the third quarter, our loading capability will be reduced for about a month due to a portion of our facility undergoing its required 10 year inspection. Our low cost expansion project increased our propane loading capabilities with an incremental 1 million barrels per month of capacity will be complete this quarter and we expect our loadings to ramp after the inspection is complete and through the balance of 2023. We are excited about the long term outlook at Targa and remain focused on executing our strategic priorities. We believe that we offer a unique value proposition for our shareholders and potential shareholders, growing EBITDA, growing the dividend and reducing share count while maintaining leverage within our target range. Before I turn the call over to Jen to discuss our second quarter results in more detail, I would like to extend a thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution while continuing to provide best-in-class service and reliability to our customers.
Jen Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $789 million. The sequential decrease was predominantly attributable to the significant optimization opportunities we benefited from in our marketing and LPG export businesses during the first quarter. Higher volumes were offset by lower realized natural gas and NGL prices and higher operating expenses. As Matt mentioned, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be higher in the third and fourth quarters as we benefit from strong volume tailwinds across our Permian and downstream assets, and are comfortable with our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA estimate of between $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion. We are well hedged across all commodities for the balance of 2023 and continue to add hedges for 2024 and beyond. Coupled with our fee floor contracts, we have significantly derisked our earnings and cash flow outlook while preserving the upside when commodity prices increase. Inclusive of our newly announced Greenwood II and Bull Moose plants in the Permian, there is no change to our estimate for 2023 growth capital spending of between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. Our current year estimate for net maintenance capital spending remains $175 million. At quarter end, we had $2.2 billion of available liquidity and our pro forma leverage was at the midpoint of our long term leverage ratio target range, which provides us with a lot of flexibility looking forward. We continue to expect year end leverage around the midpoint of our long term leverage ratio target range of 3 to 4 times. Maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet across cycles continues to be a priority. Our balance sheet strength remains the foundation that affords us the financial flexibility to continue to execute on our strategic priorities, that is investing in high returning integrated projects and prudently returning an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. The strength of our balance sheet and outlook were recognized recently by both Fitch and S&P that place Targa on positive watch. We repurchased a quarterly record of $149 million of common shares in the second quarter at a weighted average price of $71.37 per share and have repurchased over $200 million in common stock through the first half of the year. During the quarter, we exhausted our $500 million share repurchase program and had about $943 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase program as of June 30th. Looking ahead, we have significant flexibility to continue to execute under our opportunistic repurchase framework and further increase our return of capital to shareholders and reduce our share count over time. Lastly, I'd like to echo Matt and extend a thank you to our employees for their continued focus on safety and commitment to Targa. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks, Jen. For the Q&A session, we kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow up and reenter the line up if you have additional questions. Tes, would you please open the line for Q&A? Tes, we’re ready for the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Theresa Chen from Barclays.
Theresa Chen: First, I'd like to touch on the CapEx outlook over the medium to long term. To your comments earlier, Matt, about 2024 being similar to 2023, and then beyond that, the expectations for cap to step down. Do you have a sense of what do you think a post 2024 run rate CapEx could look like? And then on the heels of that in terms of capital allocation, what do you view the split in the return of capital to shareholders between dividend growth and buybacks as that free cash flow generation becomes more visible?
Matt Meloy: I talked about capital for 2024 and pointed to really some of the major projects. So let's talk about Daytona. Most of the spending we're going to have on Daytona is next year. We have two fractionators, Train 9 and Train 10, and we're also spending some money this year on GCS. So we're -- that's not a normal cadence to have that much fractionation being added, the lion's share of a transportation -- NGL pipeline being added is kind of higher than normal. Now we have a lot of that spending in 2023, too. And so that's why when you look at the major projects, those are the ones we see in process through '23 and then through ‘24. Once the fractionation Train 9 and 10 in Daytona are on line by the end of '24, then we do see a step down kind of thereafter. I don't have that exactly what it's going to look like as a run rate, what that would be. But we do see that stepping down because the lion's share of the spending for those large projects come off and it's adding our processing plants and some of the other kind of normal course capital that we have. And in terms of return of capital, our focus has been investing in our core business that gets really good returns for us. So we're going to continue to focus on investing in both the G&P side and the downstream side to take care of our volumes for our customers. And then that should provide good EBITDA growth and good ability for us to continue to return capital to shareholders, meaningfully increasing the dividend, meaningfully buying back shares. And so I think it's going to be a little bit of all of the above approach, investing in our business, increasing the dividend and repurchasing shares. And you saw us repurchase a significant amount of shares in the second quarter. So I think it's going to be all of those things.
Theresa Chen: And then looking to the second half of 2023, clearly, there's been a lot of volatility on the NGL side, whether in terms of pricing or volumes or different parts of the value chain across the industry. What is your implied contribution in the second half for NGL marketing to hit your guidance for the year?
Matt Meloy: We had a really strong first quarter in terms of marketing, really across our export business, across gas marketing, NGL marketing and we have some seasonality in the wholesale marketing business. In the second quarter, I would say it was relatively modest amount of marketing, kind of probably a low point for us if you look at it through the year. So we have some expectation for more normalized kind of marketing as you go into second and third -- into the third and fourth quarter but nothing like we saw kind of at the beginning part of the year. We're starting to see some opportunities for spreads to open up where we can capture some, but there's not any kind of outsized amount baked in for the second half of the year.
Jen Kneale: And on the LPG export side, you may have heard that we announced on this call that we expect the facility or parts of the facility on the export side to be down for a month as we complete a required 10 year review of the facilities. So that will impact the third quarter. And to the extent, though, that we see good demand internationally in the fourth quarter, we will have completed our million barrel per month expansion, Acalina Park, and we'll have that inspection behind us. We'll have a lot more flexibility to move additional cargoes in the fourth quarter on the LPG export side to the extent that there is global demand for additional volumes.
Operator: And then we will have our next question, Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Securities.
Jeremy Tonet: I appreciate that we are not giving '24 guidance at this juncture, but just wondering if you could help us sketch out the future a little bit more. Clearly, a lot of capital being deployed, very accretive terms, a lot of growth in the Permian. But is there any flavor you could give us for what post 2023 Targa trajectory could look like, just given the amount of capital being deployed?
Jen Kneale: I think that part of our conviction around all things Targa right now is the fact that we do see such a strong multiyear growth outlook on the EBITDA side. I don't think we're at a point where we want to articulate any advanced guidance for 2024. Really, it will largely be dependent on the producer forecast that we receive as we go through our planning forecast this fall. But certainly, we expect the assets that we have in progress right now to be very highly utilized when they come online, that's part of what we said this morning. And with that volume growth filling those facilities, we would certainly expect meaningful underlying EBITDA growth in a commodity environment that looks anything like we have seen this year.
Jeremy Tonet: So is it fair to say the volumes would deliver strong growth year-over-year, this is not like a step down with the hedging book, that's a big offset. Just trying to think gives and takes as we look forward here.
Jen Kneale: As I think about hedge prices right now for 2024 relative to where they are this year, I wouldn't say that there's a step down, both natural gas and NGL prices sort of approximate same prices for '23 in 2024. So I really think it's the volumes that are going to drive significant underlying EBITDA growth for us. Begins in the Permian Basin and then increasing Permian Basin volumes, of course, moving through our transportation and fractionation assets and then having those volumes available either to sell domestically or into the export market is really what positions us so well not only for 2024 but beyond that and is part of what is driving our conviction in the Targa story.
Jeremy Tonet: And just looking at the midstream industry more broadly, we've seen some kind of bigger moves take place, some mergers out there. And just wondering if we're in the midst of a period of industry consolidation, how does Targa think about that, what's Targa's role moving forward here?
Matt Meloy: Jeremy, we are really focused on investing in our core business. We have a lot of really attractive organic growth opportunities with a budget of $2 billion to $2.2 billion this year and significant capital spending next year as well. Those are really good projects for us. We've seen significant volume growth. You saw our volumes really move up across Permian, across the NGL footprint here in the second quarter. We expect continued growth the back half of '23 and into '24 and '25. So we're really focused on what we can do on an organic growth basis. That's the focus, that's where we're going to get the best returns. And so what others are doing, it's interesting, we pay attention, but our focus is on our core business.
Operator: And then we will have our next question, Michael Blum from Wells Fargo.
Michael Blum: I wanted to just go back to LPG exports for a second, notwithstanding the planned downtime in Q3. I was wondering if you could just speak to what you're seeing in end market demand for the balance of the year?
Scott Pryor: We continue to see good demand across our dock. Obviously, in the first quarter, we benefited from the outline that Matt communicated earlier and then in the second quarter, we've seen less spot opportunities. Some of that's just been driven by a less arb in the overall marketplace. We've seen some headwinds as it relates to freight economics that has tightened things up, and just when you think about just the overall seasonal demand that we came off of from the first quarter. When we go into the third quarter, again, we continue to extend the existing contracts that we have, adding contracts to our portfolio, especially as we have the expansion project coming on during this third quarter where we are getting some benefit as it relates to that today. When we look at the third quarter, despite the downtime that we were going to have because of the mandatory inspection that we have on some of our vessels at the facility, we would expect our third quarter volumes to be similar or better than what we saw in the second quarter. And then as Jen alluded to, when we look at the fourth quarter with the expansion online, with a ramp-up in demand, the seasonal demand that we typically see in the fourth quarter and first quarter we just really see a good outlook for that. Volumes through our systems will continue to ramp up and we just view that as a very positive for us overall.
Michael Blum: Also just wanted to ask about this recent spike we've seen in ethane prices. It's had some impacts on some processing plant efficiencies, some frac outages. Just curious if that impacted Targa at all for Q3 either positive or negative?
Scott Pryor: I would say it did not impact us negatively. Ethane found itself really in a volatile market during the month of July and some of that was brought on as the market was pinched between weeks of rejection and improved petrochemical operating rates. The petchem operating rates probably were likely just above 90% operating rates in the month of July and along with that, with increased ethane exports. As the price ramped up that improved some of the recovery economics as it relates to ethane rejection recovery, but there's some time lags with that. So I think the market found itself in some opportunities where it spiked in order for folks to cover various positions. For us, as we see those opportunities, we can utilize our storage, we can take advantage of the storage position that we have. So I would say that it was probably a net benefit to us to a certain degree but I would suggest that some of that may come later in the year than it would be in kind of the prompt month. So things feel like they're a little more balanced. Prices have now really come back down to more of a moderate level around $0.27 per gallon this morning. They feel a little more balanced. September is trading a little bit stronger than August currently, which would suggest there may be some mild tightness. But again, I think overall, things have balanced themselves out with the recovery economics improving.
Operator: And then we will have our next question, Neel Mitra from Bank of America.
Neel Mitra: I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the ongoing CapEx needs and two particular topics. First, it seemed like you were maybe two processing plants behind on leased when you acquired them. Are we trending on that? And then second, when we look at the Grand Prix expansion from North Texas to Belvieu, when would that be necessary from the volumes that you're getting from Daytona and Grand Prix?
Pat McDonie: Listed was behind and frankly we're still running hard to catch up. Obviously, the Red Hills plant came on shortly after the acquisition, we've added capacity at Midway, we're adding capacity pretty quickly with Wildcat II, and now we've -- and Roadrunner, and we've made the announcement on Bull Moose. All of those things are to get out in front of the activity level we're seeing from our producers in the Delaware Basin. Frankly, we have a ton of compression getting set between now and the end of the year. We're still behind a little bit and we're playing catch up, and we expect to get hopefully caught up by the end of the year on that. The production is there, the drilling activity is there. We just got to execute and get it connected and online. So the capacity adds you're seeing in the Delaware are really directly related to the producer activity levels that we have direct line of sight to. So we're not caught up but we're getting there.
Scott Pryor: As it relates to Grand Prix and Daytona, certainly, we welcome the expansion project that we have with Daytona coming online that will complement the western portion of our Grand Prix pipeline that feeds into our South leg moving into Mont Belvieu. Recognize that the South Lake has over -- 1just over 1 million barrels a day of capacity moving into Mont Belvieu, in the second quarter, we moved just over 600,000 barrels a day. So we've got a lot of operating leverage as it relates to that South lag. When Daytona comes online, we had announced initially they would have a capacity of roughly 400,000 barrels a day with a couple of pump stations that would be a part of that expansion project. So we've got a lot of operating leverage as it relates to that. With that said, obviously, we are evaluating what is the next step for us. For additional pipeline requirements, we're certainly going to watch and see how [paths] plants on the Western side in the Permian continue to ramp up over time, the additive of plants over time, but we'll certainly be in a position to expand when it's necessary and evaluate that.
Neel Mitra: And then as a quick follow-up on the ethane question. We were in rejection, I guess, for most of June. So did that impact results negatively for 2Q? And then I think I heard that you would benefit later in the year from some of the higher ethane prices, and I was just wondering how you would benefit and some commentary behind that.
Scott Pryor: I think what I would allude to there is we saw some opportunities where we actually saw some contango in the marketplace on ethane that was priced later in the year and actually into 2024. So utilizing our storage, we were able to benefit from that contango market that was presented. So I would say that it's moderate levels at this point. That's something that we, obviously, with our storage have the ability to take advantage of when there is contango plays in the marketplace. Those are not present today per se but that's where we get some slight benefits when the market moves in those directions.
Neel Mitra: And was there a negative hit on volumes on your systems just from rejection that we wouldn't otherwise have seen from the heat in Texas in June?
Scott Pryor: I would say not really on our system. Certainly, as we watch the percentage of ethane that's contained and the raw that comes into our Mont Belvieu facility it usually is more impactful in the third party pipelines than it is on the Grand Prix pipeline. I will say that we saw in the latter part of July and here in August that the percentage has moved up a little bit, probably more on the third party pipes than on Grand Prix. So that is certainly an indicator that industry as a whole is recovering more of the ethane and the field, which should benefit us over time. I think the other thing that you'll see is that given the fact that we've had a couple of industry players have brought on some additional frac capacity, that also lends to calming down, if you will, the spikes that we saw in the month of July on ethane.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Colton Bean, please proceed to your question from TPH & Company.
Colton Bean: Just on the G&P segment, a decent drop in sequential processing margins. Can you comment on where Q2 results sit relative to fee floors, and then just any general expectations for margins through the balance of the year?
Jen Kneale: In the second quarter, I'd say that our fee floors kicked in, reflecting, I think, the importance of them. I think the second quarter is illustrative of how well Targa can perform even across a lower commodity price environment, where we even saw Waha prices first of month in April, print was $0.08, $0.09. So again, I think it is reflective of the importance to us of the fee floors that we are able to continue to invest because with those floors in place, we can at least get a required minimum rate of return on that invested capital. But where we sit today, we're seeing improved prices here in the third quarter. For full year, I'd say that commodity prices on the NGL and natural gas side are, call it, 5% lower than the guidance that we set out. So we'll have to see how the rest of the year plays out. And hopefully, prices can be more of a tailwind than a headwind given we are very well hedged and given, again, in the second quarter, we were at fee floor levels.
Colton Bean: And then shifting over to the Logistics and Transportation segment. You had some very impressive NGL throughput across Grand Prix and the frac fleet, but it looks like the weighted average F&P rate moved lower quarter-on-quarter. Any basin mix shift or recontracting impacts that drove the drop and then again, your expectations for that rate trajectory moving forward?
Matt Meloy: So yes, we had really good volumes across the Downstream segment. You saw a significant ramp in Grand Prix, which was part of a contract. Part of it was just the organic growth, part was a contract roll-off we had on transport. And so you saw also really good volume increase on frac. No, I don't think there was really a mix or a degradation in our overall margins. Typically, these TNF contracts are kind of escalate over time and move up. So there just might be some volatility with marketing or what all you're including in the overall L&T margin and how much you're attributing to transport and frac.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research.
Keith Stanley: I wanted to ask about the big step-up in buybacks during Q2. Should we view that as kind of a unique opportunity because the stock fell in May and June, or is this possibly kind of a normal pace and how you think about buybacks and your capacity to do that going forward?
Matt Meloy: I think our buybacks have been a part of the way we're returning capital to shareholders. We look at -- really, I'd say it's underpinned by just our really strong outlook for not only the remainder of '23 but as we look out '24 and '25, we look at our overall cash flow profile, our leverage profile outlook for the business, it led us to step up our repurchases for the second quarter. So that was very attractive to us. In the past, in the first quarter, we had just completed the acquisition of the 25% interest in Grand Prix. So it's kind of a mix of what's our overall spending for the quarter and then what's our outlook. And I think we feel very confident in not only back half of the year, but really kind of multiyear outlook for Targa, and so that led us to step up the repurchases for the second quarter.
Keith Stanley: Second question, just the Grand Prix volumes are really high, as you said, in part from a contract roll-off on transportation. Are there any other major contract roll-offs coming up, I guess, through the end of next year that we should be mindful of that could cause another big pop in Grand Prix volumes?
Scott Pryor: I would say that no, not really. We certainly benefited in the second quarter as we had some of those midterm contracts that had rolled off. I would say that going forward, there's not really a large step up. We will basically benefit from the additive of new plants that are going on in the Permian Basin for us. Certainly, the next two plants that were announced today are something that will contribute to our Grand Prix pipeline over time.
Operator: Brian Reynolds from UBS, please proceed with your question.
Brian Reynolds: Just a quick follow-up on the CapEx cadence in the outer years with the focus on nat gas takeaway opportunities in [Apex]. Is this natural gas takeaway opportunity included in that kind of outer year CapEx decline and perhaps can you update us on perhaps Targa's equity interest or ability to fund the whole pipe on its own?
Jen Kneale: On the financing side, I think that we've consistently said, Brian, that if Apex was a project that got commercialized, it's one that lends itself really nicely to bring in JV partners and also to consider project finance. So I think we've been very consistent that if that is a project that does move forward, the likely outcome is that we would be funding it with a small portion of the equity of the project and would then utilize either joint ventures and/or project finance for the bulk of the financing.
Bobby Muraro: When you look at the parties sitting around the table, both on the producer shipper side and on the market side, it's kind of a who's who and [indiscernible] great parties, which lends itself to what Jen is talking about, the line out the door relative to the ability to raise capital in a multitude of ways to do it.
Brian Reynolds: And maybe just a quick follow-up on the NGL market. Thanks for all the prior color. But kind of just curious if you can provide a little bit more color around your propane outlook. We're trading at historical lows for propane relative to WTI. Just looking ahead into winter and a lot of the PDH demand is going online in China and competition with naphtha, just kind of curious of what you're seeing across your system in terms of interest going into winter time this year?
Scott Pryor: Currently, today, pricing sits around $0.72 we view the outer months currently today is slight contango. Fourth quarter is around $0.78. First quarter is around $0.79. The challenge that propane has today is that our current inventories stand around 88 million barrels, which is about 25 million barrels above this time last year. So that is part of the reason why you're seeing pricing relative to WTI from a percentage basis, down from what you've seen of late. I think really, when you look at it, production obviously is moving up. I think as overall global demand continues to increase, albeit there are times where you see some lulls in that. But the PDH plant -- PDH additives that you see in China that you mentioned, obviously, is a big pool of propane over time. So for us, I think it's as an industry, I think we've got adequate inventory, certainly, and I think that will provide us. The inventories have been higher historically. So this is not like it's a high watermark for us and we've been able to pull the inventories down. The other thing when you look at it from an export market perspective, you're seeing the industry continue to add vessels for LPGs, current fleet size is around 360 VLGCs. With the second half of this year, we're adding another 25 or so vessels and probably in 2024, we'll exceed 400 vessels on the water. So that clearly is an indication as an industry and as a market demand that the market is gearing up for increased demand globally as more markets mature.
Operator: We have Tristan Richardson from Scotiabank.
Tristan Richardson: Just a question. You just mentioned on offloading levels that you're seeing now. Should we think of those as sort of normal levels that you would see in any given year, or are those perhaps elevated currently in anticipation of Greenwood, Wildcat, Roadrunner? Maybe just your thoughts on offloading as a part of the portfolio?
Pat McDonie: I mean I think you're going to see it in [indiscernible] periods, right, where we're in the process of adding capacity and we need to move some gas off system until we get our incremental plant started up. So I don't know that there's a normal cadence to that. Obviously, we're building a lot of additional plant capacity with the hopes that we're out in front of our producer growth and that we're going to be able to take 100% of it. But frankly, our producers, even though we are -- we have a robust outlook on their growth, they've outperformed and it means that we've needed more capacity than we've even built. And obviously, we've built a lot. So hopefully, our offloads will remain only as needed and for short periods of time and kind of an emergency situation. And outside of that, we'll have plant capacity in place to provide those services on our own.
Tristan Richardson: And then just on your point there on customers, just always kind of curious about producer dynamics and customer activity. Like certainly, your view on inlet growth this year hasn't changed and we know your large scale customers are the major drivers. But maybe just anything on the smaller to midsize customers and change in behavior, shifts in activity, et cetera.
Pat McDonie: No. I mean, obviously, you've seen a little bit of consolidation through the acquisition market. Short term, it has no impact. And even longer term, the impact on growth on our systems is inconsequential. We really have seen a continued high activity level across both the Delaware and Midland sides of the basin. So no material will change.
Operator: We have Neal Dingmann from Truist Securities.
Jake Nivasch: This is Jake Nivasch on for Neal. Just a quick one here for me, and I know we've kind of touched on this a couple of times. So if I can tackle it a different way. Just the CapEx on the outer years, I'm just trying to get a sense strategically what that implies, I guess, from a capital allocation standpoint, it doesn't sound like especially the comments today, there's a big M&A appetite and given that the CapEx spend is coming down and the fundamental backdrop that you guys have with cash flow generation. Just trying to get a sense of what that means either for the target leverage ratio, if you think maybe bring that down or I guess, even from a buyback standpoint, would you consider going into a formulaic program? Just trying to get a sense of, I guess, how you guys are thinking about that just in general.
Jen Kneale: I think from our perspective, it really all begins with the Permian growth and the cadence of Permian growth, and how much additional infrastructure that we'll need to service our Permian customers based on that, call it, medium and longer term growth rate and then what larger assets we’ll need on the downstream side to help manage those volumes through our integrated system. But certainly, part of why we've got so much conviction in our target story is as we look out to 2025 and beyond, we expect significantly higher EBITDA growth capital coming down. That means that we'll have a lot more free cash flow available to allocate and return more capital to shareholders while also continuing to invest in the business. I think that you've heard currently the appetite for M&A is very, very low. We did two excellent acquisitions last year that are performing very, very well for us this year. And we expect, particularly the Lucid assets to perform very well for us on a growth basis as we move forward through really the short, medium and long term. I think that's all setting us up to be in an excellent position looking forward and then we'll have to figure out the ideal mix of increasing dividends and also repurchases. We like the opportunistic share repurchase program right now. I think that it's working for us, particularly as we are trying to manage leverage, a leverage ratio today of about the midpoint of our long term leverage ratio target range. I think we've spoken to our preference to manage our leverage ratio in the bottom half of that long term leverage ratio target range, but we're very comfortable running this business between 3 to 4 times. And I think again, that's what gives us a lot of flexibility going forward on that, all of the above approach that says we will continue to invest in the business in really attractive returning projects and that will help underpin an exceptionally strong balance sheet with the flexibility to return more capital to shareholders across a multitude of ways.
Operator: We have Sunil Sibal from Seaport Global.
Sunil Sibal: So I just wanted to understand a little bit better the gas takeaway situation in Permian. So obviously, you're developing your project and you also announced a number of processing additions. So from a gas take rate perspective, when do we need to see new pipelines announced to basically really service this gas out of the basin?
Bobby Muraro: What I'd say is we are relatively comfortable over the short term -- short to medium term for gas takeaway, you see something like a pipeline that went down earlier this week and the weekend. Tight enough that a whole pipeline going away does not work for the basin. But as you see, two expansions coming online in the short term and then [indiscernible] coming online next year, we feel comfortable that those will satisfy the needs over the short to medium term, depending on how you define those. And then the way we see we think another pipe needs to be in service in the 2026 time frame, so that probably means early '24. Hopefully, something else goes FID, we've said it before. If there is a meeting of the minds on the shipper side, with the market side on Apex and Apex ends up being that pipe grade. If it's not, it's another pipe, at the end of the day, Targa just wants to see that infrastructure gets built, whether it's Targa led or another party leading it. So sometime next year, we will be very supportive of our pipe or someone else's pipe, making sure it goes to make sure that all that gas is flowing if there's adequate takeaway in that 2026 time frame.
Sunil Sibal: And then my second question was related to returns. So obviously, I think in the last few years, you've posted 26% of ROIC. I was curious, when you're looking at new investments, you're approving new projects. What's a good way of thinking about your threshold on returns for [proven] projects?
Matt Meloy: The returns have been very good for Targa across our integrated gathering and processing and then following the NGL molecule through Grand Prix frac and export. So when you put that slide together, I said 26% ROIC is investment in our core business, and that's what we're investing in now. So a lot of those contracts are the same contracts, really long term, 10, 15 year contracts. So we're doing the very similar kinds of things that we did kind of last build cycle. So we feel good about the returns going forward being well in excess of our cost of capital. Typically, in the past, we have described organic growth as kind of 5 to 7 times multiple, there's perhaps a little bit of sand in there. You saw us do about 4 times was kind of what we were able to execute on. I don't know that we'll hit exactly 4 times. I think if we say 5 to 7, perhaps kind of the lower end of that is something I think we could kind of target and be able to get there. Part of it will be dependent on when you're investing what our commodity prices doing throughout that time period that can move up, can move down, that can kind of move that overall multiple. But either way, we're becoming less commodity price sensitive. With the fee based and fee margins we have in there, we see really strong returns for us on these projects, investing in our core business, GMP and then following the NGL molecule to the water.
Sunil Sibal: And just one clarification on that. So the new contracts that you're signing are basically helping you push more towards fixed fee or are they just keep the fixed fee versus the commodity sensitivity constant where it is?
Matt Meloy: Well, on the -- we're always entering into new contracts. We're amending, we're extending, entering into new contracts on the G&P side and on the downstream side. So it's a constantly moving and changing dynamic. But as we're talking with our producer customers, we have been successful and we're going to continue to push for more fee based components in our gathering and processing contracts where we had just direct straight POP exposure, we are now putting floors in place. Some of them as they come up, we're moving to fee based, there's hybrids, it's a mix. And so as those come up, as we extend, as we modify those contracts, we'll be adding more fee based component. So I just expect that to continue to move more and more fee based as we move forward.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm now showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Sanjay Lad, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations, for closing remarks.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks, everyone that was on the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thanks, and have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Matt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning to everyone. This year is off to a strong start at Targa, and we are very proud of our execution across the company in the first quarter. In Q1, we had quarterly EBITDA that was up 50% over prior year with a lower common share count. Record volumes in the Permian, record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes and strong LPG export volumes. We also finished construction and are in the process of bringing our Legacy II and plant fully online. And we are also returning an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. We increased our quarterly cash dividend by 43% and executed on $52 million of common share repurchases during the first quarter. With a strong first quarter complete and given the strength of the business fundamentals underpinning our assets, we remain comfortable with our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA estimate despite natural gas and NGL prices being about 30% and 10% lower than the price assumptions underpinning our 2023 EBITDA guidance range. Natural gas volumes across our Permian systems are growing. Our current aggregate volumes are over five billion cubic feet per day of reported inlet and are expected to ramp as we move through the year, driving incremental volumes through our integrated downstream assets. We have four plants under construction in the Permian and are ordering long lead times for an additional two plants. Given our increasing Permian volumes and resulting NGL supply growth, we announced this morning that we are moving forward with a new 120,000 barrel per day fractionator Train 10 and at our Mont Belvieu complex, which is expected to be online in the first quarter of 2025. With the addition of Train 10 and additional spending on long lead items for our next Permian plants, we now estimate full year 2023 growth CapEx spending to be between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. Investing in organic growth projects across our integrated footprint provides Targa with attractive returns and puts us in a strong position to continue to return incremental capital to our shareholders. Let's now discuss our operations in more detail. Starting in the Permian, high activity levels continue across our dedicated acreage. Our systems across the Midland and Delaware Basins averaged a record 4.8 billion cubic feet per day of reported inlet volumes during the quarter. In Permian Midland, our system has essentially been running above nameplate capacity, absent the impact of first quarter winter weather and is currently operating up over 100 million cubic feet per day versus Q1 average inlet. Our new Legacy II plant partially came online in late March, limited by electricity capacity to the site and is expected to be able to be fully available later this quarter. And kudos to our engineering and operations team for safely bringing the plant online ahead of schedule and on budget. Our next Midland plant Greenwood remains on track to begin operations in late fourth quarter of 2023 and is expected to be highly utilized when it comes online. In Permian Delaware, inlet volumes across our system increased 5% sequentially. Activity in volumes across our Northern Delaware footprint are running strong, and we have bolstered our connectivity across our Delaware assets to handle the near-term growth. Our Midway plan is close to completion and is expected to begin operations later in the second quarter. Our Wildcat 1 and Roadrunner II plants remain on track to begin operations in the first and second quarters of 2024, respectively. We continue to expect volume growth across both our Permian Midland and Delaware positions for the remainder of the year and well beyond. Beyond those projects already announced and in progress, we are evaluating when we will need additional gas processing capacity in the Permian, and we are ordering long lead items for our next Midland and Delaware plant. To that end, some of you may have seen a filing with the Texas Railroad Commission around the proposed gas pipeline we call Apex. This filing allows for preliminary survey work to be completed on proposed routes. Given how rapid we are growing with over 1 billion cubic feet of incremental residue gas from just the plants we currently have under construction, we continue to work to ensure sufficient residue take-away from the basin. As we have said previously, we remain in position to support as needed residue pipes to get Permian gas to market, whether we are leading those efforts or participating with third parties. The next pipe is needed in both our producers and markets on the Gulf Coast are keenly aware of that need. We are also continuing to add intra-basin connectivity and redundancy in both the Midland and Delaware to move residue gas from Targa plants to enhance flow assurance to get volumes from Targa assets to market. In our Central region and the Badlands volumes were sequentially flat during the quarter. Overall volumes remained steady as we are currently not seeing any material change in activity despite lower commodity prices. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment, Targa's NGL transportation volumes were a record 537,000 barrels per day and fractionation volumes were a record 759,000 barrels per day during the first quarter. With the ramp in supply volumes from our Permian systems and third parties, our Grand Prix deliveries into Mont Belvieu are currently averaging around 600,000 barrels per day with fractionation volumes currently running near capacity of around 800,000 barrels per day. GCF will provide some much needed help when it is fully restarted in the first quarter of 2024 and we expect our Train 9 fractionator to open up highly utilized when it commences operations during the second quarter of 2024. Our newly announced Train 10 with an in-service date of the first quarter of 2025 is expected to be much needed given the expected continued growth in our G&P business. Turning to our LPG export business at our Galena Park facilities, we loaded an average of 11.2 million barrels per month during the first quarter as we benefited from increased demand from stronger global market conditions. Our low-cost expansion project to increase our propane loading capabilities with an incremental one million barrels per month of capacity remains on track for mid-2023. We are well contracted across our export facility and continue to expect that 2023 will be a record year for LPG export volumes. We remain excited about the long-term outlook at Targa. Looking ahead, we continue to execute on our strategic priorities will drive increasing EBITDA, a higher common dividend and reduced common share count while maintaining leverage within our target range. We announced this morning that our Board has approved a new $1 billion common share repurchase program, which provides us with flexibility going forward to continue to be opportunistic on repurchases. Before I turn the call over to Jen to discuss our first quarter results in more detail, I would like to extend a thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution while continuing to provide best-in-class services to our customers.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $941 million, increasing 12% sequentially as we benefited from increased optimization opportunities in our marketing and LPG export businesses, contribution from our recent acquisition of the remaining 25% interest in our Grand Prix NGL pipeline earlier this year and higher overall system volumes despite lower commodity prices. As we think about the shape of quarterly adjusted EBITDA across 2023, given the benefits of optimization opportunities in Q1 and seasonality in some of our businesses, we currently expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA to be the lowest of the year, ramping from there as our system volumes continue to grow. As Matt mentioned, for the first quarter, we declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per common share or $2 per share on an annualized basis, representing a 43% increase over the first quarter of 2022. Consistent with previous messaging, we expect to maintain the same quarterly dividend for the remainder of the year. We also repurchased $52 million of common shares in the first quarter at a weighted average price of $71.82. As of quarter end, we had approximately $92 million remaining under our $500 million program and now also have a new $1 billion share repurchase program authorized and in place. Our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA estimate continues to be between $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, and we expect year-end leverage around the midpoint of our long-term target leverage ratio range of three to 4x. At the end of the first quarter, our pro forma leverage ratio was approximately 3.5x. We are well hedged across all commodities for the balance of 2023 and continue to add hedges for 2024 and beyond. Coupled with our fee floor contracts, we have significantly de-risked our earnings and cash flow outlook while preserving the upside when commodity prices increase. With our plans to move forward with the construction of frac Train 10 in Mont Belvieu, and acquiring long lead items for our next Permian gas plant, we now estimate 2023 growth capital spending between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. There is no change to our current year estimate for net maintenance capital spending of $175 million. At quarter end, we had about $2.6 billion of available liquidity, which provides us with a lot of flexibility looking forward. Maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet across cycles continues to be a priority at Targa. We believe that a strong balance sheet and continued investment in high-return projects positions us to continue to prudently return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles. Lastly, I'd like to echo Matt and extend a thank you to our employees for their continued focus on safety while executing on our strategic priorities. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks, Jen. For the Q&A session, we finally ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up and reenter the lineup if you have additional questions. Bella, would you please open the line for Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.
Michael Blum: I wanted to ask about frac Train 10. Maybe just walk us through the thought process there. It seems like there's a lot of frac capacity being added to the market right now. And as some people are starting to talk about pressure on rates. So how much of Train 9 is contracting and how much of Train 10 would be contracted or would you need to be contracted to move forward?
Scott Pryor: Michael, this is Scott. Our frac Train 10 will have a similar cost to our Train 9 facility. And as we stated in our remarks, Train 9 is expected to come online in the second quarter of 2024. Given the number of current plants that we have under construction in the Permian and our comments around ordering long lead items for additional plants, we will obviously need to with fractionation capacity for the expected production stemming from our own plants. There have been times over the course of the last few quarters that in order to manage our inventories, the influx of volumes that are coming on to our system. There are times that we have been offloading volumes both on transportation as well as fractionation. So our belief is, is that we have a strong need for frac Train 9 as it comes online. And again, frac Train 10 is trying to stay ahead of the cadence of the number of plants that we are building on the upstream side, along with the overall growth that we're seeing from the industry.
Matt Meloy: And just to add to that, Michael, this is Matt here. We see the underlying growth in our G&P business, and we're pointing that to frac Train 9, 10 and the restart of GCF. So I would suspect others as they're bringing additional fractionation on, they have volumes that they see from their customers and their contracts. We need to make sure we have sufficient fractionation capacity for our underlying G&P business so we can provide an integrated NGL service to our G&P customers.
Michael Blum: Got it. And then I just wanted to ask about the increase in growth CapEx. It seems like you're kind of moving towards that $2 billion a year, plus or minus level. Is that a fair way to think about the run rate going forward? And if not, where do you think that does kind of long-term shake out?
Matt Meloy: Yes. Michael, it is a little bit tough to do run rate as it does get lumpy during certain years when you have large long-haul NGL pipes, for example, that can be in and give you more runway. I'd also say when we made the acquisition of the North Delaware assets in the summer of last year, there was not sufficient processing capacity. So we do have a little bit of catch-up here with five plants being kind of brought online and ordering long lead time for two, that's likely a little bit heavy, if you were to do a multiyear model. That said, I think we're going to continue to have strong G&P growth. We're going to be needing to continue to add plants. So it really comes down a little bit to the lumpiness of some of the larger projects and the timing of our processing plants. But with our underlying acreage position and strong producer contracts we have in the Permian as long as they keep growing, which we see for years to come, we're going to continue to invest in gathering and processing plants, expanding NGL transportation, fractionation and export. But there could be some lumpiness from year-to-year.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brian Reynolds with UBS.
Brian Reynolds: Maybe just touch on the return of capital outlook just given the lumpiness in CapEx over the next two years. We saw some buyback in the quarter with likely some dividend increases for the next few years. So just given the rising CapEx and EBITDA outlook for the next few years from these growth projects, was kind of curious if you could discuss how Targa's balance sheet capacity moves over the next few years given that free cash flow after dividends is pretty flattish until '25.
Jennifer Kneale: This is Jen, Brian. I think we have a very strong balance sheet right now sitting at the end of the quarter around the midpoint of our long-term leverage ratio target range despite making a $1 billion acquisition in the first quarter. And we think that our capital spending really helps to create significant long-term shareholder value and position us to be able to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. As Matt described in his answer to Michael, there is some lumpiness associated with our growth capital spending, particularly around our large projects like Daytona and that means that there are some periods where we may have less free cash flow than other periods. But we believe that this sets us up to continue to execute on really where we already are, which is a road map that says we will continue to maintain a really strong balance sheet. We've got increasing year-over-year EBITDA growth really as far as we can see under a variety of scenarios and then also are able to return increasing amounts of capital to our shareholders through a significantly increasing dividend and also opportunistic share repurchases. I think that's the road map that we've shown over the last couple of years, and I think that's the road map that will continue to follow going forward.
Brian Reynolds: Great. Appreciate that. And as a follow-up, it just seems like Targa is using -- or going after a little bit more third-party contracts historically, it just seems like Targa was very much historically focused on its internal equity volumes for both the G&P and L&T side. Curious if you could just opine further on some of these new third-party opportunities that you're seeing? Is it specifically on the long-haul side or G&P as well. and whether this is a business strategy shift to win new business? Or is there perhaps just more industry cooperation to maximize asset utilization.
Matt Meloy: I'm not sure exactly which piece on the third party you're referring to, but let me just kind of answer it generally. Here at Targa, we try and really service our existing customers and our gathering and processing business, but we have been for years to get more acreage positions, more underlying volumes in our G&P business to continue to grow that business and then move those NGLs downstream. So we've been very active in managing our existing contracts and going after new customers, new areas in our G&P business. And I'd say the same goes for transportation, fractionation and export is we have a lot of those volumes from GMP moving into our system. Most of those volumes have been moving more towards GMP based on our downstream side versus just third parties that are unaffiliated with G&P. That's been a trend that's been continuing. I don't know that that's really been changing. But that said, our downstream commercial team is still focused on trying to get new business, whether it's for Grand Prix or for our fractionators to provide that level of service for customers, whether they're our G&P customers or just downstream customers. So we're continuing that effort. I don't think that's really changed for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Just wanted to come back to, I guess, CapEx and how you guys think about hurdle rates and accretion. Clearly, in this market, there's greater scrutiny on all CapEx. And just wondering, even with the lower commodity prices, I guess, if you could give us a feeling for what type of operation you see here where your hurdle rates and right now? That would be very helpful.
Jennifer Kneale: Jeremy, this is Jen. We put an ROIC slide in our February materials, partially just to very explicitly highlight just how well, we believe we've been able to invest over the last several years, particularly in projects and opportunities that we consider core. And the spending that we've announced this morning with our frac Train 10 and also additional spending around another Permian gas plant is core. Just like the spending that we're already doing for additional gas plants, fractionation and NGL transportation is core to us. So I wouldn't say that our hurdle rate has really shifted. Continues to be, call it, 5x to 7x. I think that we have been able to execute better than that, partially because our assets are so well utilized when they come online. It feels like we're almost behind every time a new asset comes online. So it's base loaded very quickly, which creates incremental more incremental returns that accrue to us more quickly than maybe before when we grew into our capacity, maybe a little bit more slowly. So I'd say that we continue to look at each and every opportunity and try to really scrub our capital spend plan are in a cycle right now where we are spending a little bit more and partially, that is a result of the lumpiness of some of our bigger projects. But ultimately, it's really across our core value chain, and we believe it's going to generate significant incremental returns for Targa and for our shareholders. To the extent that we get into an environment where we see producer activities slow down, I think we've demonstrated a track record where we've rationalized spending before. When you think about our 2020 spending of $600 million, 2021 spending of just a little bit over $400 million. We clearly have executed previously, where if activity levels are lower, we rationalize our spend. Currently, we just have a lot of expectations given the strength of the producers underlying our G&P systems for significant incremental volume growth. And that's going to necessitate a digital volumes across both our G&P and logistics and transportation footprints.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful there. And then just wanted to dive in a little bit more on reaffirming the guidance here even with the big move in commodity prices. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on some of the offset there. Just wondering how you're tracking versus the 10% Permian growth is you outlined there are better than that? And then also just LPG export trends seem pretty robust as well. So wondering if you could just help us think through some of those tailwinds.
Jennifer Kneale: We now have 1 quarter under our belt, so it's always easier to affirm guidance when part of it is already accounted for. And I think Q1 was a really strong quarter for us across the board. Record volumes in a number of different areas, and our employees also did an excellent job of optimizing our assets and generating additional opportunities from our footprint. So as we look out at the rest of the year, prices are lower, but I think we continue to see and expect excellent volume growth, again, really across all of our assets. And that's really what is underpinning our reaffirmation of our guidance despite lower prices.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank.
Tristan Richardson: Appreciate it, Matt. Maybe just a question on the residue side. You talked a little bit about Apex. Obviously, this is very early days here and really just emphasize the longer-term need for residue at a high level, but maybe kind of curious what this could look like in terms of potential end market destinations. Maybe just a little bit more detail on what the preliminary plans for this look like, maybe timing, capital, et cetera? And just thinking about is this a project that you guys are full speed ahead on or really just exploring potential options?
Matt Meloy: Yes. Thanks, Tristan. Good question. What really underlines or underlies our overall strategy for residue is to make sure that there's takeaway -- and so we want to support whether it's this Apex pipeline or others, we want to make sure that there's takeaway. We have a lot of volumes in the Permian, a lot of plants coming online. So for us to be able to charge a processing fee and the liquids down Grand Prix and into our frac, we need to make sure we're processing those volumes. We need to make sure that there's residue takeaway. So we are working -- we're doing some preliminary work on Apex. We're also talking to other customers. But I'm going to turn it over to Bobby just to talk a little bit more about that project and what we're thinking there.
Robert Muraro: Yes. So this is Bobby. At the end of day, what we want to see is we want to see all the residue move out of the Permian Basin. So whether it's on a pipeline like Apex or a third-party pipeline or 1 that we're a part of. We'll just be excited to see pipelines go. And then as we think about what Apex could look like if it did go we ultimately have no shortage of residue supply to put to a pipe between us and our customers. And I think everybody knows what's going on with the market down there in that general vicinity of the state with LNG and other demand coming on. So as we think about that, the potential for that project to come together at some point in the future, kind of goes to what happens with other pipes what we end up doing on other pipes versus Apex and then what the market does down there and how it develops. Taking these things all up is a fairly complicated process. And we just want to make sure that there are options out there that we can execute on to make sure the residue flows, whether it's the pipe in '26 that will be needed or a pipe that's needed in '28 as all those facilities down there in the Sabine River corridor come online and have a very strong demand for gas.
Tristan Richardson: Appreciate it, Bobby. And then maybe just a follow-up. I think we all know the scale and the quality of your customers, both in the Midland and the Delaware. But maybe curious to the extent you're seeing any discussion of change in development plans or responding to price signals in the market, even if it's at the margin and on very small customers, but just any comments on maybe the long tail there.
Patrick McDonie: Yes. This is Pat. Really, we haven't had any change in activity. Activity levels remain high. rigs are running on acreage all around our system, on our system. We haven't -- the big guys obviously are disciplined. They tell you guys what they're going to do, and they continue to execute on their plans. Some of them are a little more back-loaded this year than in previous years. But the rigs are running the wells are getting drilled. The little guys, frankly, we haven't seen any change in activity there yet either. They continue to be very active, and we're bringing on a lot of incremental volumes for the median and smaller guys. So to date, we have not seen a change in activity levels are high.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays.
Theresa Chen: On frac 10, in terms of the time line, that seems to match with when you may be able to move over some of the Y-grade volumes coming off with the legacy loss processing plants onto your own system. Now that you've had these assets under your belt for some time, can you give us a sense of when do you expect that to ramp up higher in the cadence?
Matt Meloy: Yes. Sure. Theresa, it's Matt. For frac train, whether it's 9, 10 or GCF, we really see that our underlying G&P business and continued volume growth and just execution from our producer customers. We do have some contracts that roll off from time to time. Those are -- most of those are T&F where it'd be more transportation and fractionation. So between now and 2025, we do have some of those. But the lion's share of the need for frac Train 10 is just from underlying continued activity from our producers in our G&P business.
Theresa Chen: Got it. And then in terms of capital allocation and on the buybacks specifically, I understand that you don't have a programmatic approach to this, and it's more on an opportunistic basis. But just given the volatility in the dislocation in the market we saw during the first quarter, was there a reason why you didn't want to utilize this tool kit this tool in your toolkit more?
Jennifer Kneale: Theresa, this is Jen. You saw us partially utilize the tool by buying a little bit more than $50 million in the first quarter. We also made a $1 billion acquisition of our remaining interest in Grand Prix during the quarter. So part of what we're just trying to balance each and every quarter and then annually is just our spending requirements, whether that be a result of acquisition activity, like in the case of Q1 with the Grand Prix acquisition or other capital spending with the opportunities that we see in the market. And we were able to step in, we believe, when given the opportunity in Q1 in a manner that we are very comfortable with.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.
Keith Stanley: I wanted to start on the NGL and gas marketing for the quarter. I mean it looks just based on the percentage of margin like a record quarter for the company. So can you talk a little more to the types of activities? I guess did you fully anticipate the strength you saw this quarter as of the last call? Or did you see more opportunities in March? And then just overall expectations for the rest of the year, should we assume you kind of go back to normal on marketing? Or are you continuing to see opportunities to do better?
Matt Meloy: Yes. Sure. Keith, I'd say when we gave our guidance, part of that was already factored in. The guidance was given in February, we already had some of those seasonal opportunities, I'd say, and saw the strong LPG export market. We really had good performance across traditional kind of NGL marketing, gas marketing and LPG exports, part of which was known when we gave the guidance. So that was factored in to some extent. . As we go forward, I'd say we do see kind of a more normalized level as we go throughout the year. That's why Jen kind of pointed to a weaker Q2. So I think Q2 is going to be a little bit weaker. We don't see those kind of outsized opportunities that we saw in but kind of more normalized as we move throughout the year.
Keith Stanley: Great. And then I guess just on the frac capacity. So I think you said in your prepared remarks, you were already at 800,000 a day recently, which I think is your capacity and then you reactivate GCF early next year. So can you still grow frac volumes within your system over the balance of the year? Or are you at a point where you need to start offloading a little more already into the second half of the year?
Matt Meloy: Yes. We do have the ability to grow more. So we said we're around 800. We can do low 800s of Y-grade at Bellevue. We also have our Lake Charles frac, which we can push some more volumes over there. And we do have ability to push volumes to other fracs. And in any given month, we're unloading and offloading back and forth between different players in Bellevue for different reasons. So we feel good about being able to handle all of our volumes between now and when GCF comes on the first part of next year, and then we'll get even more relief when Train 9 comes on. But that gives us comfort that we're going to have volumes for our GCF startup and when it comes on.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colton Bean with TPH & Co.
Colton Bean: Matt, I thought I heard you reference securing long lead items on two additional plants. So first, I wanted to verify the plural versus singular there. And then any comments on the planning horizon and how you see potential constraints shaping up across your Midland and Delaware footprint?
Matt Meloy: Sure. Yes, you did hear that correctly. Last call, we talked about long lead items for one plant. Now we're securing long lead items for two plants. So I'd expect us to be greenlighting 1 or both of those plants relatively shortly. So we're kind of signaling that. In terms of constraints, we have had really strong performance. We kind of gave those updates here where we are currently running. We have enough capacity to handle our volumes from processing and transport and frac, but that is why we're adding more capacity along kind of that whole value chain as we see continued growth through the rest of this year, we think it really sets us up for a strong 2024 as our volumes really ramp through the back half of the year, and we'll have more capacity coming on in 2024. For gathering and processing, I'd say it's getting pretty tight on the processing side in both the Delaware and the Midland. The good thing about our plants and just the way our engineering teams have designed these is we have stretched above nameplate. So we're putting in 275 million a day plants. So even when we're at capacity, we can stretch up on these plants and go to, call it, 300 or so on most of these plants. So that gives us good flexibility and we've got gross capacity of almost 6 Bcf a day out there. So if you can move that 10% it gives you a pretty good flex on the processing side. Then on the NGL side, we've been adding pumps on Grand Prix. That's giving us some running room, but that's why we're adding Daytona as we see pretty good line of sight to needing that when that comes on, and then we've talked about the frac expansions. I'd say the other piece that we're looking at. We have an expansion coming on in the export business this summer, one million barrels a month of propane loading. That is our next one. We're taking a hard look at and trying to determine for us what the right next project is for us. So we're still kind of working through that with engineering operations and just timing of our overall volumes when we may need further export expansion.
Colton Bean: Great. And just in terms of planning horizon, I think the latest dated plant we've got right now is Roadrunner II and kind of mid-'24. So should we think about these as being biased to the back half of '24, maybe early '25?
Matt Meloy: Yes, that's probably reasonable. Yes.
Colton Bean: Great. And then just back on the power supply issues you saw at Legacy II. I guess, one, can you expand on that? And then two, do you see any additional timing risk to ERCOT interconnects as you move toward completion on your other plants?
Matt Meloy: Yes. So we have Legacy I there already. So we're able to -- using the existing infrastructure. We had some extra capacity, which is why we're running Legacy I is kind of in that it has the ability to be about 100 million a day. If you load up legacy One, we can load Legacy II to about $100 million or so a day. that should be -- we should have all the electricity work done, the infrastructure done later this quarter. So we'll have full access to the full $275 million. That is 1 of our timing constraints as we're putting in future plants. That tends to be 1 of the longer lead items to get put in place is the infrastructure. These plants that we're putting in I mean the last 12 or so plants we put in have all been electric. And it just takes time to get all that situated as it's a very large electric load.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global.
Sunil Sibal: So when I look at processing ads in Permian, it seems like one to 1.2 Bcf per day of total processing adds you're going through end I was curious if you know out of that, how much visibility you have on the residue gas take away just as a ballpark page?
Matt Meloy: Yes. So for the plants that we're putting in, we are connecting to various residue outlets to make sure we have transport intra-basin to Waha that we can then get to market from there. So we'll have connectivity within the Permian Basin for those plants. And then it really just goes to the broader basin is their takeaway out of the basin and what does that look like? We have some compression expansions coming on. We have a long-haul pipes coming on mid next year, which should provide some relief. So it feels like when the long-haul pipe comes on next year, we'll have some runway. But that's why, as Bobby talked about, we're beginning -- we've begun work and discussions on Apex and what this next pipeline is after Matterhorn.
Sunil Sibal: Got it. And my second question was a bit more longer term. Where do you see the balance sheet in terms of credit ratings over the medium to long term. I think some of your competitors kind of looked at shoring up ratings to mid-BBB. Is that the thought process with your team also.
Jennifer Kneale: Sunil, this is Jen. I think that ideally we'd like to be at least a mid-BBB company. And right now, we're sitting one notch lower than that. I think that we have a very strong balance sheet right now. So we're really comfortable with where our leverage ratio is today and the trajectory of that leverage ratio. So ultimately, we believe that we'll continue to execute as we have historically, which is execute across all dimensions of our business plan and then the ratings will be a result of that execution. But I would expect as we continue to manage through this year and into next year and our leverage ratio continues to improve, we'll be looking to inquire about a potential upgrade with the agencies.
Operator: And your last question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Cap securities.
Neal Dingmann: This is Jamison for Neal. Thank you for the questions here. I know we've touched on this a couple of times, but I just want to go back to the EBITDA guide for the year. I know you end marketing specifically. So I know you guys said marketing was, I guess, a little bit stronger than expected to some extent and that is going to be normalized for the rest of the year. And so given the fact that you also said that volume growth is looking strong for the remainder of the year as well. Just trying to figure out, is there -- does this mean there's upside to the maintained EBITDA guide, given that 1Q strength in marketing? And I said that because I see a bullet in the slide deck that cite higher marketing and optimization, which I don't think was there prior. So just trying to get a sense of, I guess, what implications are there?
Jennifer Kneale: I think as we think about balance of the year, there's always the potential for additional upside in terms of higher commodity prices, if volumes exceed our expectation. If we see more optimization opportunities or if we've got commercial success beyond what we've already got baked into our forecast and that materializes this year. So we'll have to see how the rest of the year plays out. But certainly, you're hopefully hearing our excitement, not only that we have a really strong Q1 under our belt, but also that our outlook is as strong as it is. But we'll have to see what happens with prices and ultimately when volumes materialize. And if we see more volumes than we expect our volumes ramp a little bit more slowly than we expect.
Operator: And I see no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Sanjay Lad.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks, everyone that was on the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thanks, and have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-22 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Targa Resources Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Also be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to the Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations, Sanjay Lad. Please go ahead.

In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. Statements made during this call that might include Targa Resources' expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings. Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer; and Jen Kneale, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, the following senior management members will be available for Q&A. Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay. And good morning to everyone. 2022 was an excellent year for Targa, and I would like to recognize and thank our employees for their focus, dedication and execution. Some of our highlights from 2022 include record safety performance based on multiyear low total reportable incident rate, record gathering and processing volumes in the Permian, record volumes across our logistics and transportation assets, record adjusted EBITDA of $2.9 billion, a 41% increase over 2021 while also reducing our share count. Major projects came online on time, on budget and have been highly utilized since start-up. Execution and successful integration of our Delaware Basin acquisition and our South Texas acquisition, execution of our corporate simplification with our DevCo repurchase and preferred share redemption, successful sale of our 25% equity interest in Gulf Coast Express Pipeline for approximately 11 times EBITDA, upgrades to investment grade by all of the rating agencies and completion of two successful investment-grade offerings and higher year-over-year return of capital to our shareholders through both an increased common dividend and continued common share repurchases. We expect our momentum to continue through 2023 and beyond, given the strength of the business fundamentals underpinning our assets. There is a continued need for critical midstream infrastructure like Targa's to balance and link cost advantaged U.S. production to domestic and global markets. Global events have underscored the critical nature of safe, reliable and affordable fossil fuels to support everyday life domestically and around the world. Cost advantage basins like the Permian, where we are the largest gatherer and processor of natural gas, will continue to be a key supplier of hydrocarbons for decades to come. We are less than two months into the year and already had some notable announcements, including the successful negotiation and closing of our acquisition of the remaining 25% interest in our Grand Prix NGL pipeline, our early January offering of 10- and 30-year senior notes that funded the Grand Prix acquisition and reduced floating rate borrowings on our revolver. And within this morning's release, our operational and financial estimates for 2023, which are expected to be records across many fronts, including an estimated 24% increase in year-over-year adjusted EBITDA. Our transfer and construction of a plant from our South Texas acquisition to the Delaware Basin, which we are calling the Roadrunner II plant, where activity around Southern New Mexico is currently exceeding our expectations. And an expected 43% year-over-year increase to our 2023 annualized common dividend per share versus last year. For 2023, we estimate that our adjusted EBITDA will be between $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion. The significant year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA is driven by higher expected gathering and processing volumes, higher expected NGL transportation, fractionation and export volumes, higher expected marketing optimization and LPG export opportunities, higher fees from contract escalators, a full year contribution from our Delaware Basin and South Texas acquisitions, contribution from our acquisition of the remaining 25% interest in Grand Prix and higher hedge prices. Related to capital allocation, maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet across cycles continues to be a priority at Targa. We also have attractive opportunities to continue to invest organically, which we believe will support the continued creation of significant shareholder value over time. We currently estimate between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion of growth capital in 2023 as we build infrastructure that we expect to be highly utilized across our footprint. Our major projects in progress are core to our business, five new Permian gas processing plants, Train 9 fractionator and our Daytona NGL pipeline. Along with our partners, we are also in the process of restarting the 135,000 barrel per day Gulf Coast fractionator in Mont Belvieu, which we expect to be operational in the first quarter of 2024. Beyond those projects already announced, and in progress, we are evaluating when we will need additional gas processing capacity in the Permian, and we are ordering long lead time items for our next Midland plant. We believe our organic growth opportunities create value for Targa and our investors over time as we have demonstrated strong returns over the last five years. As you can see from Slide 4 in our earnings supplement presentation, we generated an attractive 26% return on invested capital since 2017, despite a volatile commodity price backdrop over the last several years. For our recent major capital projects, we have invested at a low single-digit multiple of EBITDA as the immediate high utilization of assets like new gas processing plants have resulted in very attractive returns despite higher build costs from inflation. A strong balance sheet and continued investment in high-return projects positions us to continue to prudently return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles. We announced an expectation of a 43% year-over-year increase to our annualized 2023 common dividend per share this morning. The increased dividend will be recommended to our Board in April for the first quarter of 2023 with payment to shareholders in May. Our expected 2023 dividend increase reflects a lot of different factors, including our near- and long-term business fundamentals and balance sheet strength across scenarios, flexibility associated with our increasing size, scale and fee-based margin and Targa's positioning relative to our midstream C-Corp peers [ph], the S&P 500 and cyclical industries within the S&P 500. We also expect to be in a position to continue to execute opportunistically under our common share repurchase program, which will allow us to further increase our return of capital to shareholders and reduce our share count over time. We bought back $225 million worth of common shares in 2022 and had about $144 million remaining under the $500 million share repurchase program we put in place in October 2020. Our current expectation is we will request Board approval to authorize a new $1 billion share repurchase program once we exhaust our existing program. We believe that we will offer a unique value proposition for our shareholders and potential shareholders, growing EBITDA, growing dividend and reducing share count. We expect to continue to set expectations for our annual common dividend each February when we announce our financial and operational guidance and expect to continue to increase our return of capital to shareholders over time. In addition, to our standard annual disclosures around our financial expectations, we also included in our investor presentation this morning, describing Targa across upside and downside commodity price scenarios. We have spent the last many years focused on increasing our cash flow stability and reducing our volatility to downward moving commodity prices. As you can see from Slide 12 in our earnings presentation relative to our full year 2023 financial guidance, a 30% move higher in commodity prices from our guidance levels would increase adjusted EBITDA by around $100 million, while a 30% decrease would reduce adjusted EBITDA by around $60 million. This asymmetric risk, where we have significantly more upside than downside across commodity prices continues to be an area of focus at Targa where our commercial teams are working really well with our producers and other customers to maintain alignment to be in a position to continue to invest across cycles. As we look forward, we believe that Targa is in excellent position to continue to provide best-in-class service to our customers and create additional value for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Jen to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results in more detail as well as our expectations for 2023.
Jen Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $840 million, increasing 9% sequentially as we benefited from the first full quarter of our Delaware Basin acquisition, optimization opportunities and recent processing additions across our Permian systems despite lower commodity prices and operational impacts from Winter Storm Elliott. Full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA was $2.9 billion, 41% increase over 2021, driven by record volumes in gathering and processing, NGL transportation and fractionation. Our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of the year was 3.7x well within our long-term leverage ratio target range. We spent approximately $552 million on growth capital projects in the fourth quarter and our full year 2022 growth capital spend was $1.177 billion, about $30 million of growth capital shifted from 2022 into 2023. Maintenance capital spend for 2022 was about $168 million. We repurchased approximately $28 million of common shares in the fourth quarter. And as Matt mentioned, had approximately $144 million remaining under our $500 million share repurchase program at year-end. In early January, we announced and shortly thereafter closed our acquisition of the remaining 25% interest in our Grand Prix NGL pipeline for approximately $1.05 billion. The acquisition price represented an 8.75x multiple of Grand Prix's estimated 2023 adjusted EBITDA, which we believe was an attractive purchase price. With 100% ownership of Grand Prix, including our Daytona pipeline expansion, we benefit from having significantly more operational flexibility and also near and longer term capital synergies. We funded the Grand Prix acquisition through a successful $1.75 billion offering of 10 and 30 year senior notes and used the incremental proceeds to reduce borrowings on our revolver. We currently have about $2.5 billion of available liquidity, which provides us with a lot of flexibility looking forward. Turning to our expectations for 2023, as Matt described in his remarks, we really are very excited about the continued momentum at Targa. We estimate full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA to be between $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion, a 24% increase over 2022 based on the midpoint of our range, assuming commodity prices of $2.25 per MMBtu for Waha natural gas, $0.70 per gallon for our weighted average NGL barrel and $75 per WTI crude oil barrel. We are well hedged across 2023 and beyond and are benefiting from significant additional fee-based margin year-over-year. We expect significant margin benefit in the first quarter from increased LPG exports, natural gas and natural gas and NGL marketing optimization opportunities. Please see the additional disclosures that we added to our investor presentation this morning on sensitivities to commodity price changes and our hedges. We currently estimate between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion of growth capital spending based on announced projects and other identified spending and $175 million of net maintenance capital spending. Operationally, high activity levels continue across our dedicated acreage in the Permian. Our reported full year 2023 average Permian Basin natural gas inlet volumes are projected to increase about 10% over average fourth quarter 2022 Permian inlet volumes. There is no change to the estimated in-service dates of our plants under construction with the Legacy II and Midway plants expected in service in the second quarter of 2023. Greenwood in service late in the fourth quarter of 2023 and Wildcat II in service in the first quarter of 2024. As Matt mentioned, we are also moving a plant acquired in our South Texas transaction to the Permian Delaware which we are calling Roadrunner II and expect in service in the second quarter of 2024. The significant increase in Permian Basin volumes is expected to result in record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes in 2023. There is no change to the expected in-service dates of our major downstream projects with Train 9 expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2024 and the Daytona NGL pipeline complete by the end of 2024. GCF will provide some much needed help on the fractionation side, and we expect it fully restarted in the first quarter of 2024. We will also benefit from the mid-2023 completion of our project at our Galena Park LPG export facility, which will increase our propane loading capabilities by about 1 million barrels per month. We are well contracted across our export facility and are estimating that 2023 will be a record year for LPG export volumes for Targa as well. We expect to pay an annualized common dividend in 2023 of $2 per share and have the flexibility to continue to use our common share repurchase program opportunistically to return incremental capital to shareholders through the year. Our balance sheet is strong with leverage near the midpoint of our long-term leverage ratio target range of 3x to 4x, and we expect to end 2023 around the midpoint of our range, providing continued flexibility for Targa going forward. Lastly, I would like to echo Matt and extend a thank you to our employees, their continued focus on safety while executing on our strategic priorities and continuing to provide best-in-class services to our customers. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks, Jen. For the Q&A session, we kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up and reenter the lineup if you have additional questions. Carmen, would you please open the lines for Q&A?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Matt Meloy: Hey, Good morning, Jeremy.
Jen Kneale: Good morning.
Jeremy Tonet: I wanted to touch on the 2023 guide, and I want to touch on three components to it, if I could. Just wondering as far as Permian volume growth, I'm just wondering, the growth seems very strong here. Do you see yourselves growing faster than the base on your acreage? Or do you see yourself taking market share just curious on the drivers of the strong Permian growth there. And then also, I guess, the drivers – what are the drivers behind marketing optimization stepping up in LPG exports stepping up? Just color on those points would be super helpful.
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure, Jeremy. On the Permian growth, yes, we are seeing significant activity across our acreage, both in the Delaware and the Midland, so part of that relates to the recent acquisition that we made. There is a lot of activity. And frankly, it's exceeding our expectations for the opportunities there. I don't know, Pat, do you want to give some additional color on what we're seeing in Permian?
Pat McDonie: Sure. And if you think about this year versus last year, you start January and February with basically 50 more rigs than what you had last year. They levelize for the remainder of the year, but obviously, off to a better start than what we saw last year. Then when you look historically of how Targa performed in the Midland Basin, we always have outperformed the average growth across the Midland Basin. We performed well in the Delaware Basin, but Lucid on the other hand, significantly outperformed the average growth in the Delaware Basin. So with that asset in our Delaware side of our overall Permian portfolio, we have the best-performing assets on the Midland side, the best-performing assets on the Delaware side. That coupled with the rigs currently running on that acreage. Our line of sight with a great producer group and what they're doing, and we're very in tune with them. We feel very, very good about our volume forecast.
Scott Pryor: And then Jeremy, as it relates – this is Scott, as it relates to the LPG export business and the growth that we're seeing for 2023. Just recognize third quarter versus fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter volumes were up. We expect that our first quarter volumes here in 2023 will be up there. And then obviously, with the increase in production that we're seeing, on our integrated platform, speaking to what Pat was talking about feeding through our downstream assets, we see opportunities there for continued growth. And that is certainly complemented by the growth that we're seeing across the global marketplaces. Benefiting on that side is things like the reopening of the Chinese marketplace. Increased demand for PDH demand in Asia as a result of that. We’ve also seen improvements on the shipping side because we’re seeing new deliveries of VLGCs which is providing more liquidity on the water and certainly some improvements in efficiencies out of the Panama Canal. So I think the combination of all those, which will certainly also benefit with the small expansion that Jen spoke to in her opening comments, that will be online mid-year. That 1 million barrels per month of additional capacity will just complement what we’re doing. And as Jen also mentioned, we continue to be highly contracted while also feeling comfortable about the available space that we would have to participate in a spot market when the market presents itself. So that lends flexibility to our customers, reliability to our customers while also providing economic benefit to Targa when the pricing firms up at times.
Matt Meloy: Yes. And just to add to that, Scott, and Jeremy, I know you asked about our optimization on our marketing, I’d say we had really good opportunities in the fourth quarter in both NGL markets and natural gas markets as we move a lot of volumes of both products. And when there’s increased volatility, which we saw in the fourth quarter, we were able to optimize and make some additional margin there. And we’re off to a strong start in the first quarter as well, which is why we kind of pointed to that in our 2023 guide. So we’re already kind of factoring in some of that that has already occurred this year. So we do expect a strong first quarter because of some of that optimization as well.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Great to hear, strong data points across all three components there. And just one last question, if I could. I want to touch on capital allocation a little bit more, and you gave some thoughts in the prepared remarks and in the PR, but I just wanted to touch on, I guess, how you think about that in the future? I mean, we had a very nice 43% step-up in the dividend here. It’s going to be an annual determination going forward. But – how do you see – can you give any more color on what future years could look like to bookend us to make sure we don’t get off the rails. And as far as capital spend is concerned, is this kind of how – kind of closer to the peak? Or do you expect this level to persist?
Matt Meloy: Sure. Yes, Jeremy, on capital allocation, our priority within how we want to spend both organically and return capital to shareholders. We want to start with a strong balance sheet and make sure we have flexibility to continue to invest and to continue to return capital to shareholders over time. The good thing about our forecast and what we’re showing this year is we think we can do all of that. We think we can grow our EBITDA, invest in our business while significantly increasing the dividend, which we did – or which we anticipate to do for 2023. I think we have the ability for future significant dividend increases as we go forward. Just as you look at our EBITDA growth, strong balance sheet, I think we’ll have some ability to continue to grow the dividend while continuing to buy back shares. We were pretty active in 2022, buying back shares. I see us being opportunistic in how we buy back those shares, but we have the significant ability to continue to repurchase shares. So that is where we see us position, growing our EBITDA, growing our dividend and reducing our share count over time.
Jeremy Tonet: Wonderful. Thank you so much.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thanks, Jeremy.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And it comes from the line of Brian Reynolds with UBS. Please proceed.
Brian Reynolds: Hi, good morning, everyone. Maybe just to follow-up on some of the guidance assumptions. You talked about the 10% Permian exit-to-exit growth, which implies just really strong Permian growth once again. You recently had some plants come online full during 4Q, and it seems like plants can’t come online fast enough with over half of capacity coming online next year. So curious of how much of those offloaded volumes coming back on the Targa system post the Lucid acquisition is baked into that volume forecast? Or should we effectively assume those volumes coming back onto the system as upside to your Permian growth forecast? Thanks.
Pat McDonie: I would say that we do have some offloads in the Delaware Basin and minimal on the Midland side because we just brought a plan up, right? And we’ve got another plant coming up fairly quickly in the next, call it, six to eight weeks on the Midland side. So we feel like we’re in pretty good shape in Midland. And there isn’t anything currently being offloaded that will come back on to the system. On the Delaware side, because Lucid was behind in processing capacity, we had some things to do there. We brought up the Red Hills VI plant in September. Frankly, it was immediately full. We had existing connections between the Targa Delaware system and the Lucid system, which we were immediately able to offload 150 million a day into our Far West plant complex is the Peregrine and Falcon plants and we had available capacity. We also had contracted some third-party offload capacity, which we have retained because, frankly, the performance of those assets is better than what we had in our acquisition case. And I think you can see by what we’ve announced, we’ve got the Wildcat II plant coming on. Midway will be that – Midway that will be that midway point, basically adding capacity in May. Wildcat II at the end of the year, the very beginning of next year because of the anticipated growth and the Roadrunner announcement right behind that coming on because, frankly, we’re going to need it. But we’ve done some things in the meantime. We’ve increased our ability to move the old Lucid system, what we call Targa North Delaware gas into our Far West plants, which, again, we have available capacity. So over the next, let’s call it, 9 months to 12 months, one will fill up the Midway capacity. We had a little bit of remaining capacity at Wildcat. We have a sweet plant at Loving that’s kind of our swing plant that will fill up. And then we utilize the offload in the Peregrine and Falcon capacity to get us to the Wildcat II plant. And don’t forget, we have the ability to run our plants over nameplate, which can give us another 100 million to 150 million a day of incremental capacity.
Brian Reynolds: Great. Thanks. Sounds like there’s a significant amount of roadway of growth in the Delaware over the year. As my follow-up, the last 24 months, we’ve just seen Targa integrate and simplify itself in a series of transactions to become the S&P 500 company it is today. Moving forward, as you talked about, there seems to be a healthy amount of organic growth opportunities within Targa. And thus, given the amount of organic growth backlog, should we view the recent Grand Prix M&A as kind of the last piece of simplification of Targa at this time? Or are there other missing pieces to the portfolio that could use some of that excess free cash? Thanks.
Jen Kneale: This is Jen. I don’t think that there are any missing pieces to the portfolio. I think we are very pleased with the asset footprint that we have and see significant opportunities for continued organic investment going forward that will help underpin that increasing year-over-year EBITDA growth that we expect. The Blackstone acquisition, you’re exactly right. That, in our view, was an acquisition, but a simplification as well. And I think operationally and in terms of how we invest capital around our NGL transportation assets going forward, it just gives us enhanced flexibility. So we do see that as sort of the final piece of our simplification story. Going back to beginning with the DevCo and then the TRC preferred repurchase.
Brian Reynolds: Great. I’ll leave it there. Thanks for the color and enjoy the rest of your day. Thanks.
Jen Kneale: Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And it comes from the line of Spiro Dounis with Citi. Please proceed.
Spiro Dounis: Thanks, operator. Good morning, team. I wanted to go back to the commodity sensitivity that and that asymmetry that Matt referenced earlier. I guess it’s a bit different than how you guys were traded in the past. And I guess I’m just curious, is that an indication that that fee floors could trigger before a 30% down move in commodity prices. I know the calculation is probably a bit complex, but just curious how you’re thinking about the fee floors and maybe what’s embedded in that low end of the guidance beyond the commodity move down?
Jen Kneale: Spiro, this is Jen. We’re really proud of the efforts of our commercial teams over the last many years to put in fee floors really across our gathering and processing businesses. And part of what we wanted to provide today was additional information that indicates that the Targa of today looks very different than the Targa of several years ago. And a big reason for that is the fee floors that we have in place. So we tried to publish was that if you had a significant move downward in commodity prices, it would be, call it a 30% down move would be about a $60 million impact to our 2023 adjusted EBITDA. And I think that is again reflective of not only the fee floors, but we also just have a lot more fee-based margin now both on the logistics and transportation side, which is essentially all fee-based margin and then also on the gathering and processing side, where the Lucid acquisition was the latest element of fee-based margin that we brought into the portfolio. So I really think it’s a combination of a number of factors that we think demonstrates that Targa’s downside exposure is significantly reduced today than what it was previously. And that’s all enhanced by our hedging program that really hasn’t changed over the last several years. But I do think that it’s realistic to assume that in a 30% leg down in commodity prices across the Board versus what we had in our guidance, the fee floors would all be in play at that point.
Spiro Dounis: Okay. Got it. That’s helpful. Thanks for that, Jen. And then maybe just to go back to the volume growth. It sounds like it is exceeding expectations and a lot of discussions so far has been around the processing plants. And Jen, I know you mentioned that all the in-service dates for expansions, including Daytona, are all still in place. But I guess on my math and just based on some of this discussion, it would seem like Grand Prix is going to get pretty tight potentially before Daytona could come online. So I’m just curious, is there an ability to bring that on sooner or in phases? Or do you have any sort of bridging solutions if that gets tighter than expected?
Scott Pryor: Spiro, this is Scott. First off, I would say that when we look at Grand Prix, we’ve been – obviously, the success of that is evident. And the continued growth that we’ll see in the Permian will feed into that. Just recognize that as we enter into 2023, we’ve got some additional pump stations that will commission throughout 2023, probably more heavily in the first half of this year versus the back half of the year. And during that time frame, we would push our overall capacity up to what we call our nameplate of roughly 550,000 barrels a day just on the West leg alone. We feel comfortable that we can likely operate above that, call it, in the 600,000 barrel a day range. And then we will certainly be expediting as quickly as we can the installation of the Daytona pipeline. Fourth quarter of 2024 is kind of where we’re at with that. We’re calling at the end of 2024, but we’ll be working hard to make sure we get that online as quickly as possible. In the interim, if we do have some situations where we need to offload capacity, we’ve got a number of plants that are connected to multiple pipelines, and they’re not solely dependent upon just the Grand Prix pipeline. So we feel that we’ve got a lot of flexibility to manage through it. We certainly want to make sure that it’s preferred that the volumes are moving on our pipelines. But we’ve got some opportunities to manage through that, if necessary, if the volume growth exceeds our expectations.
Spiro Dounis: Great. Appreciate all the color today, guys. Thank you.
Scott Pryor: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And it comes from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Theresa Chen: Good morning. I’d love to get your take on the frac outlook, given the tightness that we’re seeing evidence in anecdotes of tightness in the Gulf Coast, maybe most recently from the restart announcement at GCF, would you mind giving us an update on your outlook on utilization for the part of the value chain and general demand outlook for the purity product maybe touching on some that LPG export commentary? What are you hearing from your petchem customers? What are your general expectations for demand for ethane and LPGs?
Scott Pryor: Again, this is Scott. So when we look at the fractionation complex that we have, certainly bringing on GCF that the partnership has agreed to restart. That will start. We expect to commission that in the first quarter of 2024, and that will be needing capacity. I will say that when you look at our volumes that we had from third quarter to fourth quarter of 2022, those probably don’t illustrate exactly the volume growth that we’re seeing over time across our various assets and alluding to the comments that Pat made as it relates to our growth on the G&P side of our business. We did have some planned and unplanned outage at our facility during the fourth quarter, which really basically is behind us now. So we feel as though that we should be at our – basically at our full complement of fractionation capacity going forward. And some of that, when you look at the impacts of that, we’re also impacted by Winter Storm Elliott. We obviously have substantial amount of storage that allows us to manage the influx of products on the inbound side, whether it’s Y-grade, spec products as well as on the outbound side. So we feel very comfortable with that. But certainly, the additive of Train 9 coming on in the second quarter of next year will be an important piece of the pie for us from a fractionation perspective. As it relates to the distribution of products on the spec side, certainly, products of inflow of product coming into us. The LPG export facility that we have at Galena Park is a very important integral piece of our platform that we have today for propane as well as butanes. And again, what we mentioned earlier with the small expansion we have that provides us additional capacity there. And so we feel very comfortable with our expectations on that side. As it relates to ethane, certainly, the market continues to pull on the ethane molecule. We’ve had a number of petchem expansions that have been announced recently. New expansions have come online over the course of the last two years. And our team has done an excellent job as we’ve added fractionation capacity as we have future expansions that are coming online, the team has done an excellent job of increasing our connectivity to the downstream petrochemical market to make sure that we can clear that ethane molecule. So we view that that is a continuation of that. And I think the petchem industry is starting to really get more on solid footing as it relates to improvements in the global economy that going forward look good for us.
Theresa Chen: Thank you. And Jen, I wanted to go back to your comments about the breakdown between fee-based versus commodity-based margin. Now that you are 85% fee-based, as you bring online incremental processing capacity embedded with contract escalators over time fee floors, et cetera, how do you think this breakdown evolves? And with the asymmetric risk that you currently see within that 60% band, do you see that becoming more favorably skewed going forward as you layer in more for fee floors and general fee-based margin?
Jen Kneale: I think that we have demonstrated a commitment to our producers to continue to invest capital and infrastructure to support their drilling activities. But in order to do that, we need to have protections in place that we’ll get at least a minimum rate of return on that invested capital. And so I think that we have seen good support in our areas where we are spending capital to put in fee floors and we are trying to bring that to other basins as well as contracts come up for expiration or there’s a catalyst for a renegotiation. And I do think it creates excellent alignment for us to continue to invest and benefit from higher commodity prices, but have a little bit of production in a lower commodity price environment. I think it’s difficult to see us going from 85% fee-based margin to 100% fee-based margin just by the nature of our assets. I think we’re also very comfortable with the commodity price exposure that we have, particularly if it can be with a fee floor structure in place. So I think that’s the trend that will continue for us. And our commercial teams have really done a great job of putting those fee floors in place when they’ve had the opportunity to do so. And so I believe that, that will continue to be a big point of focus for us, but it’s difficult to predict what that means in terms of where fee-based margin goes in the future. But I would expect that we will continue to have more margin protected with the fee floor structure.
Theresa Chen: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And it comes from the line of Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Please proceed.
Colton Bean: Good morning. So the transport and frac unit margins were up materially relative to Q3. Any drivers on that apart from lower OpEx? And was there a mix shift in basin origin or any contracts that moved around and then between the two transport and frac any weighting in terms of the margin uplift?
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure. Hey, Colton. We really benefited from a couple of things there. We had, as I mentioned before, some optimization just related to our marketing activities in both NGL marketing and gas marketing. What Scott also mentioned is our fracs that we had some planned and unplanned maintenance, we were bringing in more fractionation volumes, and we were able to fractionate. So here in the first quarter, those are behind us, and we’ll be operating closer to nameplate, so we have the opportunity to either build inventory or to do some offload. So we were able to execute some offload at cheaper rates than our overall T&F. So it kind of creates the margin spread for us even though our volumes did move up as much. So I’d say we have more volumes coming in than kind of what was reported because that’s what we actually fracked, but we were able to do some third-party offloads that work is really behind us. So we have more capacity now in Q1. So that is, for us, creating a little bit more flexibility in terms of the overall frac market. And with other fracs coming on in 2023, we see some looseness in 2023 in the frac market. So we’ll be able to, I think, be in good position ahead of GCS start-up and Train 9 coming on. But it was really a combination of all those things.
Colton Bean: Okay. And so it sounds like it was more concentrated on the frac side and relatively stable for transport?
Matt Meloy: Yes. I think that’s about right.
Colton Bean: Great. And then on OpEx. So Q4 was relatively flat for G&P and actually down in logistics. I think previously, you were expecting continued increases as you had a full quarter of Lucid and then higher overall activity. So just – was Q4 more of a structural shift in your outlook? Or should we still expect that step-up in expense levels heading into 2023?
Jen Kneale: Colton, this is Jen. What tends to happen is through the year, we overestimate what our ad val costs may end up being just because we generally tend to forecast conservatively. And so as those costs come in throughout the year, it means that often fourth quarter OpEx for us steps down a little bit versus prior quarters on that front. So that was a benefit for us in the fourth quarter. And then our teams have also done just an excellent job of managing our operating expenses as well. Within the fourth quarter, we did have OpEx associated with Winter Storm Elliott, which our team did a great job of managing through. We’ll actually have a little bit of OpEx that comes into the first quarter related to Winter Storm Elliott, but it’s also just a really well management, particularly on the G&P side, where we did have the step up or expected step-up from the Lucid acquisition and then managed it very, very well. On the downstream side, we had the benefit also of lower ad valorem costs in the fourth quarter. And we also had repairs and maintenance in the third quarter that Scott mentioned. And so there was a step down there just because we did not have those repairs and maintenance in the fourth quarter. Those were one-time.
Colton Bean: Great. Appreciate the time.
Jen Kneale: Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thanks, Colton.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Keith Stanley: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Just wanted to start on commodities and hedges. So if I compare the hedge prices for 2023 to the forward curve where it sits, are your hedges now in the money, would you say, for this year? And so additive to EBITDA or are they below market still? Asking across commodities, just to try to give a better picture of where an unhedged outlook might be for 2023 versus the $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion guidance?
Jen Kneale: On the hedge disclosures that we gave this morning on the natural gas side, that’s aggregated swaps across everywhere that we hedge. So I’d say that the majority of those hedges are Waha swaps where actually would say that Waha prices for balanced 2023 are now lower than where we have hedged. So it’s a little bit of a mixed bag depending on each basis point that we hedge to and the swaps that we have in place there. On the NGL side, I think where prices are right now is really since the beginning of the year, we’ve seen NGL prices that are a little bit higher than where we have hedges in place. We’ll just have to see how that plays out for calendar 2023, and we’ll be continuing to layer in hedges as we move through time and then our exposure to WTI crude prices just isn’t that significant, but prices are a little bit lower, I think, today than where we’ve got our hedge prices sitting.
Keith Stanley: Okay. So overall, big picture, you’re a little above market on gas, a little below on NGLs and crude, but net-net, it doesn’t sound like the hedges materially change what the EBITDA outlook is for the year?
Jen Kneale: No, I think that’s fair. We had, call it, north of $400 million of hedged losses in 2022, and we’ve said that we’re hedged at higher prices this year. So articulated that that was a tailwind for 2023 relative to 2022. And then when we think about where hedges are relative to where prices sit today, maybe a little bit of a tailwind, but we’ll have to see how it plays out through the year.
Keith Stanley: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Second question was just on the CapEx guidance, are you baking in any spend for unannounced plants or other likely future spending? And related to that, just how are you thinking about the potential need to start work on a frac 10 before the end of this year? Or is that now pushed out into 2024 with the GCS?
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure. So for – we have the five plants that we have announced. And also said in the script, we are ordering long lead time items for another plant in the Permian Midland. So we factored in some of that CapEx into this overall guidance. So it really depends on when we greenlight that and say, okay, we are going forward with it. So there could be some additional shift of capital if we greenlight that plant sooner rather than later. And I’d say right now, we are evaluating even though we’re adding Wildcat II and Roadrunner II, we are evaluating potentially another plant out in the Delaware. So we’re going to see kind of how the first part of this year plays out and if we need to go forward with another plant sooner rather than later. Right now, that’s not factored in. We’re evaluating. We have a lot of plants coming on between the Midway Wildcat II, Roadrunner, and we have some offload capability. So we’re trying to be capital efficient there, but we kind of have our eye on when we’re going to need another plant in the Delaware. As far as frac Train 10, again, I think let’s see how volumes kind of play out this year and what producers are saying for next year. We have Train 9 coming on. We have GCF coming on. But we are talking about when we’re going to need Train 10 when you have kind of 10-ish percent growth on the footprint that we have, that significant amount of NGLs moving through Grand Prix moving into our frac. So I’d say we’re having discussions on when we’re going to need to add Train 10, and we’re trying to kind of evaluate that as the year plays out.
Keith Stanley: Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Neel Mitra with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Neel Mitra: Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could speak to the capital associated with moving Roadrunner to the Delaware. How that would compare to a new build? And then where would you be moving that plant into the Delaware? And where are you seeing that pocket of growth that would require that plant to be moved there?
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure. What’s great about where we’re moving that is it’s connected to our existing footprint, so the Roadrunner II will be right next to the Roadrunner I plant, which was part of the Lucid acquisition. There’s the Red Hills complex and the Roadrunner, which will now be a complex when we add that there. The overall capital fed is about $120-or-so million for that move. So it is capital efficient relative to just doing a new build. The new builds are, say, closer to $175 million, give or take. Those are – the new builds are about $275 million. The Roadrunner move is about, call it, $230-or-so million. So you get a little more capacity on the new build, but still on a per unit basis, a little bit better for the move and timing, being able to move it does help our timing. As Pat mentioned, we’re getting tighter on capacity out there. So moving it is quicker than just putting a new build out there.
Neel Mitra: Okay. So just to clarify, this would be for the Lucid acreage and wouldn’t necessarily connect to Grand Prix. Is that fair?
Matt Meloy: What’s interesting is what’s the Lucid acreage were started now it’s all Targa and it’s really getting mixed. When you talk to producers, is it – a Targa system, it’s all becoming really quickly all one system out there. And Sorry, Bobby, do you want to add some color on that?
Bobby Muraro: Yes, this is Bobby. I was just going to say also when you think about the scale of the system in the Midland Basin and the fungibility across areal extent of it. You don’t exactly drop a plant right on top of acreage that you see coming because we can move volumes across the entire system. So as we start to build out the Delaware in the same manner, such that we’re putting plants, generally speaking, where we see growth. All the growth doesn’t have to happen right at the top of the year because of the fungibility of that system. And the integration of the loose assets that we bought into our existing asset footprint with the big AMI we did with Chevron several years ago, it creates fungibility such that, that’s a convenient place and a fast place to put Roadrunner, but it also is gas can flow from lots of different spots to that plant.
Matt Meloy: We’re also working to connect Roadrunner and integrate that system into Grand Prix, so we’re building that line now.
Neel Mitra: Got it. And then if I could just follow up on Grand Prix. It seems like for the second half of 2022 volumes were relatively flattish. And I know early 3Q, you had some ethane rejection and that’s set to recovery, maintenance and weather, should we see a step-up back in kind of 1Q? Or are there any other kind of lingering issues on Grand Prix in the volumes for you, you start stepping back up to kind of be consistent with the processing growth?
Matt Meloy: Yes. We expect volumes to start moving higher here as we get into the year. What you see there is Grand Prix is mix between Permian and our North leg, which goes up into Oklahoma. We’ve seen continued growth on our West leg. We have seen volumes move South a little bit kind of as we’ve not as much strength there as you’ve seen in the Permian. So it’s looked relatively flat. But we are already seeing it. Frankly, the start of this year we’re seeing volumes move higher, and that’s what we would expect in Grand Prix as we move through the year, pretty strong growth there.
Bobby Muraro: And I would also just add, Matt, that we've got – the second half of this year, we've got some third-party contract contribution that will be coming in from the North leg more the back half of the year. So you'll see those volumes starting to ramp up for deliveries into Belvieu as well.
Jen Kneale: And just so we touch on every quarter of growth for Grand Prix. In the second quarter, we'll have Legacy II coming online and then the additional capacity available at Midway. So those will be nice catalysts in the second quarter.
Matt Meloy: Yes.
Neel Mitra: Got it. Thank you for all the color.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And comes from the line of John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
John Mackay: Hey. Thanks for the time. Wanted to just sit on Permian growth for another half second and clarify one comment from before. Were you saying that – the growth outlook right now is 10% off of fourth quarter 2022 assumes no incremental rate adds off of what we've seen so far through February? That's the first part. And then second, I'd love to just hear how you're thinking about the other basins, relatively less gas-driven exposure, of course, but we're seeing slowdowns elsewhere. So curious what your view on maybe the Barnett and others look like? Thanks.
Matt Meloy: Yes. I'll hit the first one, and then Pat can comment on the second. Yes, we were not specific on the rig adds I'd say we do a bottoms-up build with our producers in both Midland and Delaware, and there's a combination of some folks adding and doing more and some doing less or shifting, so it's an aggregate of all of those. We don't – we haven't given one number instead it assumes rig adds or takeaways. It's a bottoms-up build, but we also kind of do a top down and say how they performed relative to history. And then what do we really expect to do. So it's kind of the usual way we do a forecast on that. And then, Pat, do you want to hit on other basis?
Pat McDonie: Sure. We'll start in Oklahoma. We've seen, frankly good activity in both our South Oklahoma and our Western Oklahoma areas. Good activities relative to, let's call it the last three, four years prior to that, obviously, there was a lot of activity. But enough so that we're able to offset decline. Frankly, in Southern Oklahoma, we show where we were basically flat and frankly that includes a pretty significant chunk of volume rolled off under a contract, and we were able to fill that back in behind. So we are seeing some activity there. North Texas, we have – we've seen volume growth on our system, and we continue to see drilling activity. Certainly, it and frankly Southern Oklahoma are more sensitive to gas prices. So we have expectations at the beginning of the year here that we'll get to incremental volumes. There are planned drilling on our system throughout the year. We'll ultimately see how those pan out dependent upon commodity prices and the decisions of those producers. Our South Texas activity has been very good. The addition of the Southcross assets and the sour gas capabilities there have added a level of drilling activity and some of our contracts that originally underpinned the assets, those producers are active. So we've seen benefits in volumes from both of those kind of types of producers. So we feel good about volume growth there, but it's not significant in the overall scheme of things. [Indiscernible] same thing, a good steady pace of drilling. So good replacement of crude oil and natural gas, are we going to say how we're going to significantly grow in that basin. Now are we going to hold our own and see some slight growth probably?
John Mackay: All right. That's great. Thank you for all that. Maybe just one last one for me on CapEx. Just curious if you could talk a little bit about any inflation pressure you're still seeing flowing through, whether that's on the plants or on kind of just gathering compression side, just anything kind of directionally there? And how we can kind of think about that going forward? Thanks.
Matt Meloy: Yes. We are seeing some higher costs, whether it's compression pipelines or just the larger facilities we're putting in place. And I'd say part of the CapEx, too, that included in the 1.8, 1.9 this year is us with longer lead times on some of the assets, we are buying some compression right now, which is longer lead time, which is actually for 2024. So part of it is us getting ready because I know there's going to be future growth next year because lead times have been extended is pushing some more CapEx into this year as well. So part of it has been inflation, part of it is us trying to get ahead of kind of some of the supply chain disruptions and lead time growth.
John Mackay: All right. Thanks for the comment. Appreciate it.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thanks John.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Okay. One moment please. We have a technical difficulties on this side. All right. And our last question for today will be from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global. Please proceed.
Sunil Sibal: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everybody.
Matt Meloy: Good morning.
Sunil Sibal: I just wanted to get a little bit of clarity on the returns on investments. I think a few years back, you had talked about a 5 to 7x kind of EBITDA multiple for gathering and processing capital spend. I was curious how that has changed in the current environment?
Jen Kneale: I think that we've actually seen an improvement in those returns, partially because as a result of, I think, being very capital efficient when we bring new projects online, they tend to be very well utilized, particularly on the gathering and processing side. So we've actually seen the returns improve just as a result of utilization as we try to get plants constructed as quickly as possible, but as Pat mentioned, sometimes have to operate the system overcapacity prior to a new plant coming online and/or utilized third-party offloads, that means that once the new plant is online, it tends to be very highly utilized or at least that has been our very recent history. And so I think that's driving returns lower on that side of the business – returns higher on that side of the business, so multiples lower, sorry.
Matt Meloy: Yes. I'd say – just to add to that, I think as we think about going forward, 5% to 7% is still kind of what we think about and how we would articulate returns. We were able to execute better than that. If you look back over the last five years, closer to 4 times. And also part of that is we were successful in investments like, for example, GCX. We invested and we sold that at a significant multiple of capital, a really good return for us, and that kind of nets into the CapEx number. So we had some onetime items like that, which also helped drive that higher. But I think 5% to 7% is a good kind of planning case and we'll of course try to beat that through optimizing, but 5% to 7% is a good point in case.
Sunil Sibal: Okay. Thanks for that. And then one clarification. I think in the past, you've talked about the spend on the compression and pipeline being 1:1 with a new builder processing plant cost. So I think on the previously in the call, you said $175 million is what a new typical processing plant is costing. So is that 1:1 thumbnail [ph] still good for the other capital to fill up the plant?
Matt Meloy: Yes. I think over time, that's a reasonable assumption. I'd say now what we have been seeing recently is potentially even a little bit more capital efficient than that. So maybe a little bit less as some of our producers are being more efficient with where they're drilling; so– but it can vary from year-to-year. So I'd say that's not an unreasonable assumption. Maybe I'll take the under on that. Maybe it's a little bit less gathering and compression versus the $175 million to fill up a plant but it can vary from year-to-year as well.
Sunil Sibal: Got it. Thanks for that and congratulations on a good print.
Jen Kneale: Thanks Sunil.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A Session. I will turn the call back to Sanjay Lad for final remarks.
Sanjay Lad: Thank you, everyone, that was on the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR Team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, and everybody, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-03 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Targa Resources Corp. Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Webcast and Presentation. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Sanjay Lad, VP of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks, Gigi. Good morning, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call for Targa Resources Corp. The third quarter earnings release, along with the third quarter earnings supplement presentation for Targa Resources that accompany our call are available on our website at targaresources.com in the Investors section. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. Statements made during this call that might include Targa Resources' expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and latest SEC filings. Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer; Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; Robert Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer; and Jen Kneale, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Matt, who is recovering from laryngitis for his comments and Q&A participation today will be limited.
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning, and apologies for my hoarse voice. Our overall business is continuing to perform well and our strong execution continued across the third quarter, including record high quarterly EBITDA, record volumes in the Permian, record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes, integration of our Delaware Basin acquisition, successfully bringing on two plants in the Permian Basin safely, ahead of schedule and on budget, $73 million of opportunistic common share repurchases, and were also recently added to the S&P 500. Our record third quarter EBITDA was attributable to higher base business volumes, particularly in the Permian, plus a partial quarter contribution from our Delaware Basin acquisition. While commodity prices are significantly lower than the assumptions underlying the updated full year 2022 financial expectations that we provided in early August. There is no change to our expectation to generate full year adjusted EBITDA between $2.85 billion and $2.95 billion. Given the significant growth in volumes that we expect looking forward and to catch up on some of our Delaware Basin infrastructure, we announced this morning that we are moving forward with a new 275 million cubic feet per day gas processing plant in the Permian Delaware, which we are calling the Wildcat II plant. The growth in volumes across our G&P business also necessitated the announcement this morning that we are kicking off construction of the Daytona NGL pipeline, which will transport volumes from the Permian Basin and connect to our existing segment of Grand Prix and North Texas, to move volumes down to Mont Belvieu. The acceleration of these additional projects shift some spending into 2022, but there is no change to our year-end 2022 leverage ratio expectation of about 3.5 times, meaning we continue to have significant financial flexibility looking forward. Before I turn the call over to Pat, I would like to extend a thank you to our employees for their continued focus on safety while executing on our strategic priorities and continuing to provide best-in-class services to our customers. I will now turn it over to Pat, to discuss our G&P operations in more detail. Pat?
Pat McDonie: Thanks Matt and good morning everyone. Starting in the Permian our systems across the Midland and Delaware Basins averaged a record 4.1 billion cubic feet per day of volumes during the third quarter, including two months of contribution from our recently completed Delaware Basin acquisition. Given our performance year-to-date we expect our full year average 2022 Permian volume not including our Delaware Basin acquisition to increase at the high end of our initial 12% to 15% year-over-year volume guidance. In Permian Midland, our inlet volumes increased 8%, sequentially as our system essentially ran at capacity until our new legacy plant came online late in the third quarter. We have an incremental 550 million cubic feet per day of processing expansions underway in Permian Midland. Our Legacy two plant remains on track to begin operations during the second quarter of 2023. And our Greenwood plant remains on track to begin operations late in the fourth quarter of 2023. Similarly, we expect both plants to be highly utilized when they come online next year. In Permian Delaware, inlet volumes across our system not including contribution from our Delaware Basin acquisition increased 7% sequentially. We have successfully integrated our Delaware Basin assets and employees and appreciate the efforts of the collective Targa team that supported the integration. We commenced operations on our new 230 million cubic feet per day Red Hills VI plant in late September which was full at start-up. Our overall Delaware system is also running highly -- very highly utilized and volumes continue to ramp. And we remain on track to bring our new 275 million cubic per day Midway plant online during the second quarter of 2023. In response to strong producer activity levels and to meet the infrastructure needs of our customers across the Delaware and as Matt previously mentioned, we are moving forward with the construction of a new $275 million per day plant in Permian Delaware which we are calling the Wildcat II plant. Wildcat II is expected to begin operations in the first quarter of 2024. We are playing some catch-up on our newly acquired Delaware Basin assets as evidenced by Red Hills VI being full at startup, the expectation that Midway will be highly utilized on start-up and now moving forward with construction of the Wildcat II facility. All a positive reflection of how quickly current volumes are increasing and future volumes are expected to increase. We are also adding incremental treating infrastructure in the Delaware to increase our gas handling capabilities which enhances our ability to capture and handle increasing gas production and drive attractive returns from treating fees. This will also give us the ability to capture CO2 from the treating process and sequester the emissions in our acid gas injection storage wells. We have already obtained Class II permits and are working on MRV plans and additional Class II and Class VI permits to further enhance our carbon capture abilities. We expect to begin receiving 45Q tax credits as early as the fourth quarter of 2023. Shifting to the backgrounds our natural gas and crude gathered volumes rebounded in the third quarter following the reduced reported volumes impacted by late weather storms in the prior quarter. In our Central region a full quarter contribution from the acquired assets in South Texas and solid activity levels in Oklahoma and North Texas drove a sequential increase in aggregate volumes during the third quarter partially offset via contract expiration in South Texas. Scott will now discuss our logistics and transportation business in more detail. Scott?
Scott Pryor: Thanks Pat. Targa's NGL transportation volumes were a record 500,000 barrels per day. Fractionation volumes were a record 742,000 barrels per day during the third quarter. Our volumes would have been higher had it not been for some ethane rejection across our system and third-party systems during the third quarter plus some maintenance at our Mont Belvieu facility. Given the anticipated growth from our volume growth from our Permian G&P expansions growth of third-party volumes and volumes we can transport after the expirations of obligations on third-party pipelines our outlook for continued NGL transportation volume growth is strong. Today we announced plans to construct the Daytona NGL pipeline to transport NGLs from the Permian Basin and connect to the 30-inch diameter segment of the Grand Prix NGL pipeline in North Texas. Daytona is expected to be in service by the end of 2024. Targa will own 75% of Daytona and Blackstone Energy Partners will own 25% and with each member funding the respective share of the pipeline's cost based on their ownership percentage. With an estimated project cost of about $650 million Targa's net growth CapEx share is estimated to be approximately $488 million. In Mont Belvieu construction continues on our Train nine fractionator which is expected to begin operations during the second quarter of 2024 with an estimated cost of around $450 million. Turning to our LPG exports. We loaded an average of 8.5 million barrels per month during the third quarter as we were impacted by reduced spot cargo opportunities and some cancellations due to weaker global market conditions. We currently expect fourth core volumes to improve but will be impacted by similar global dynamics and some required maintenance at the terminal. Our low-cost LPG export expansion project to increase our propane loading capabilities with an incremental one million barrels per month of capacity remains on track for mid-2023. I'll now turn the call over to Jen.
Jen Kneale: Thanks Scott. Good morning everyone. Our record quarterly adjusted EBITDA and operational stats reflect that our business is performing really well. Our balance sheet is strong. We are continuing to invest in our business. We are returning an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders and we are very excited about Targa's outlook. Let's now go over some additional financial information. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $769 million increasing 15% sequentially as we benefited from a partial quarter contribution from our Delaware Basin acquisition, higher volumes across our gathering and processing and logistics and transportation systems and higher fees partially offset by lower NGL prices and higher operating expenses. Higher operating expenses were primarily attributable to our recent Delaware Basin acquisition, increasing activity levels across our G&P systems, including two plants placed in service in the quarter and inflation. While costs were higher, just a reminder that for Targa, inflation is a net tailwind across our businesses, as we benefit from inflation-linked fee escalators across our commercial contracts. Targa generated adjusted free cash flow of $291 million in the third quarter. We repurchased about $73 million of common shares in the quarter and year-to-date through September 30 have repurchased about $197 million of common shares at a weighted average price of $65.23. Since program inception, we have repurchased about $328 million of shares at a weighted average price of $35.45. As of quarter end, we had approximately $172 million remaining under our $500 million equity repurchase program. For the third quarter, we declared a cash dividend of $0.35 per common share or $1.40 per share on an annualized basis and consistent with previous messaging expect to maintain the same dividend for the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, we currently plan to provide our full year 2023 operational and financial outlook in February, in conjunction with our fourth quarter earnings call and will also then provide color on our expected annualized dividend and share repurchase strategy for 2023. We are well hedged for the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we are currently about 80% hedged in 2023 across all commodities related to our exposure from our percent of proceeds contracts and are hedged at higher prices in 2023 than 2022 hedge prices. As Matt mentioned, our performance this year has been strong and we continue to estimate our leverage ratio will be around 3.5 times at year-end. During the third quarter, we upsized our accounts receivable securitization facility to $800 million and extended the facility to September 1, 2023. We spent about $625 million of net growth capital through the first three quarters of 2022. With some additional spending accelerating into 2022 for the Wildcat II plant and the Daytona NGL pipeline announced today, we now estimate 2022 net growth CapEx to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. Our estimate for 2022, net maintenance CapEx remains unchanged at approximately $150 million. We have strong momentum heading into 2023, backed by continued volume growth across our integrated businesses and we expect to benefit from full year contributions from our Delaware Basin and South Texas acquisitions, higher fees and higher hedge prices. We are focused on continuing to manage our leverage ratio within our three to four times long-term target range, with a preference to be in the lower half of the range and believe that the strength of our underlying business puts us in excellent position over the long term to continue to invest in attractive organic growth opportunities and return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. We published our 2021 sustainability report in early October and kicked off an initiative that is very important to us, where we engage with our largest shareholders each fall specifically around ESG to get feedback on our latest report and ESG-related efforts. We take our responsibility seriously and are committed to practices that create value for our shareholders and benefit the communities we serve and our latest report is hopefully reflective of that commitment. Lastly, I'd like to echo Matt and thank our employees for their dedication and for continuing to prioritize safety. With that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks, Jen. For the Q&A session, we kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up and reenter the line up if you have additional questions. Gigi, would you please open the line for Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Colton Bean from Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.
Matt Meloy : Good morning.
Colton Bean: So just starting off on Grand Prix, is there a general capacity buffer that you all were targeting when deciding when to bring Daytona into service? I guess asked differently, is there any risk of constraint on target NGL egress of Daytona timing were to slip a quarter or two?
Scott Pryor: Hi, Colton this is Scott. We've, obviously, been watching our volumes as it relates to Grand Prix both on the West leg and the North leg that feeds into Mont Belvieu for some time now and clearly watching the cadence of the plants that we've been adding on the G&P side of our business and along with the Delaware acquisition that we made. So we are keenly aware of the volumes that are moving and the timing of announcing Daytona fits with our expectations. We feel very comfortable with the fourth quarter operating that start in fourth quarter of 2024. And again with Daytona when you look at the volume growth that we've got from our G&P business, third-party volumes, expirations the third-party pipe volumes over time. It's a very good project for us. And especially it leverages the capacity that we've got available on our 30-inch pipeline that feeds into Mont Belvieu. So that gives us plenty of room over a period of time. I'd also like to state that when we start up Daytona and how it complements our Grand Prix West leg we'll also get some efficiency on the fuel side of things as we operate. It allows us to better operate pumps that are along the existing West leg in addition to how we would operate the pumps on the Daytona side.
Colton Bean: Great. And Jen maybe commenting over to hedges. I think you mentioned being above the normal course 75% for 2023. Can you expand on where you sit for next year and just the broader thought process on doing above your programmatic level?
Jen Kneale: I think based on the view that we had that there was likely to be Waha tightness and potential impacts on prices on the Waha side. We've added additional hedges particularly around natural gas, Colton. So are hedged above the 75% level on natural gas, actually significantly higher hedged than that right now for 2023. Then on the NGL side, we're a little bit higher hedged than the 75% level. Just continuing to watch backwardation of NGL price markets, and to the extent that we get strength we have tried to hedge into some of that strength. And then we've got a little bit of condensate exposure in our well hedged they're well north of that 75% level to. And those hedges are all related to our percent of proceeds contracts. So we do have commodity exposure elsewhere in our business, but have tried to do a very good job of hedging in advance of 2023 to help underpin continued cash flow stability across our businesses.
Colton Bean: Great. And it sounds like a natural gas the hedges also include an attempt to reduce basis risk.
Jen Kneale: Yes. We hedge directly to our basis points and certainly have tried to be far in advance of any price risk around Waha in 2023. Our gas marketing team has done a really good job of trying to manage not only takeaway transport but also our hedge exposure there.
Colton Bean: Great. I appreciate the time.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Jen Kneale: Good morning, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: I just want to kind of walk through, I guess, the results quarter because if you look at the last guide and we overlay kind of the commodities how they changed and what your sensitivities were it seemed to put some pressure on EBITDA expectations for the year possibly below the bottom end, yet you were able to reaffirm the guidance range. So it seems like some positives materialize versus I guess prior expectations there. Just wondering if you could provide a bit more detail on what those were and if you see them continuing into 2023. 
Jen Kneale: I think that we have a pretty good track record of forecasting guidance conservatively, Jeremy, which is part of it. But also the underlying business is just performing really, really well. So when we think about the volume increases that we're seeing across our systems it feels like every quarter we're reporting record Permian volumes even ignoring the acquisition of the Delaware Basin assets, which will bring significantly more volumes to our system and then on the transportation and fractionation side as well. So while prices were weaker in the quarter, we're comfortable with where our guidance is set right now for the rest of the year. We've got only two months to go. And again, I think, that the business is performing so well that we're really setting up nicely heading into 2023 as well. 
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful there. And then looking at 2023 and recognizing the guide is not coming until February, but just wondering if you could provide any high-level thoughts as far as capital allocation where CapEx could shake out and how you think about the best way to return capital. 
Jen Kneale: I think 2022 provides a little bit of a road map for how we're thinking about returning capital to shareholders. We entered 2022 focused on managing our leverage to levels that we are comfortable with and then also simplifying and also continuing to invest in the business and returning capital to shareholders. And I think that we've been able to execute across all dimensions in 2022. So for 2023 thankfully, we've got the simplifications behind us. No more DevCo. No more pros more And so it really allows us to focus on maintaining that balance sheet strength that we've spent so much time over the last several years talking about and then continuing to invest in our business additional organic growth capital opportunities that are very attractive for us like Wildcat II and like Daytona and like all the other projects that we have in progress, and then continuing to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders through higher dividend and additional share repurchases. So I think it will be a similar road map in 2023 and we look forward to describing that in February. On the growth capital side there's some lumpiness just related to the types of projects that we spend capital on. So when you think about Daytona and Wildcat II, a little bit of capital accelerating into this year, but a lot of capital on both of those projects will be spent in 2023. And then there's still lumpiness around Train 9 spending. So there's significant Train 9 spending in 2023 as well along with just the natural cadence of plant ads compression ads and gathering line ads. So 2023 capital will be higher and we'll give more visibility to that in February as well. But certainly, we're very comfortable and believe that similar to our spending this year underpinning EBITDA growth 2023 over 2022, the spending that we'll be doing next year is what will set us up for continued EBITDA growth going forward as well. 
Jeremy Tonet: That’s very helpful. I will leave it there. Thanks.
Jen Kneale: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Reynolds from UBS. 
Brian Reynolds: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just to circle back on [indiscernible]. Could you just talk a little bit about the synergies seen so far to capture some of those offloaded volumes. Curious, if you can just talk about how the transaction multiple is being worked out perhaps before all of those volumes fully work its way through the target integrated system in a few years? Thanks.
Pat McDonie: Yes. Red Hills VI came on in September. It's full. Frankly, volumes were greater than the capacity of the system including Red Hills VI. So immediately what we were able to do is offload some of the gas on the Lucid system into our Western Delaware plants, which had spare capacity. Pretty significant volumes frankly. Lucid was in the process prior to acquiring them seeking out offloads. We had some in place with them already and certainly, upon completion of the acquisition we stepped that up considerably and are building additional infrastructure that allows better communication between the – what we call Target North Delaware system, the old Lucid assets in our existing Delaware footprint. So the integration has gone pretty seamlessly. The volume growth is substantial. So we can get it done the better. But we're definitely seeing benefits of the integration and we'll see additional benefits via some of the projects that we've announced this morning. 
Brian Reynolds: Great. I appreciate that. My one follow-up entering 2023 just given some operational issues from some peers. There's various projects that are coming online in 2023 but curious, if you could talk about the GCF frac on iLink [ph] or if there's any desire to simplify that JV over the next year or two? Thanks.
Scott Pryor: Hey, Brian, this is Scott again. We are evaluating with our partners at GCF recognizing that is in a partnership as to what the timing would be of moving that from an idled asset to an operating asset. So we don't have a definitive date at this point but the discussions are happening and just trying to understand what the volumes look like for not only Targa but respectively also for our partners in that. With that said obviously, we are moving forward with our Train 9. That would be operational in second quarter of 2024. And in addition to that we also have a permit in hand for our Train 10. So as we continue to evaluate the build-out of our GMP footprint, how that feeds into our Grand Prix system, the expansion with Daytona, those deliveries into Mont Belvieu, the termination of when we would start a Train 10 or restart a GCF asset, we will be certainly taking all those volumes into consideration.
Brian Reynolds: Great. Super helpful. [indiscernible] and everyone.
Jen Kneale: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research.
Keith Stanley: Hi, good morning. I wanted to start a couple of quick follow-ups on Daytona. Should we assume a pretty even split on the CapEx between 2023 and 2024? And did you say the capacity of the expansion I think previously you talked to maybe 550,000 a day. 
Jen Kneale: Keith, this is Jen. In terms of spending we've got a little bit that's coming into 2022. And then we'll have spending of course in 2023 and actually more in 2024 than in 2023 is what we currently have forecasted but we're trying to get Daytona online as quickly as possible. So that may shift between 2023 and 2024, but that's what the spending currently looks like right now. 
Scott Pryor: And then as it relates Keith to the volume expectations, when we start up Daytona, it will have an initial capacity of about 400,000 barrels a day. And just as a reminder, our current West Grand Prix leg has a capacity of roughly 550,000 barrels a day. So they will complement each other very well. And again, as I stated earlier in our comments, we would operate those two lines together in order to get fuel efficiencies across both lines.
Keith Stanley : Thanks for that. My second question is on Permian gas. I guess, first, I'm just curious how -- if you have a view on how much of the weakness we've seen this fall has been due to maintenance versus a tighter-than-expected market. And any updated thoughts on the potential to support a new takeaway project either through contracting or ownership and we might hear more on that.
Robert Muraro : Hi. This is Bobby. I'll tell you I think it's a combination of a lot of things at the end of the day. You have I think better production than some people have forecasted and then more maintenance than everyone had planned for along with some pipelines still being out relative to El Paso going west out of the basin. So I think from that perspective, it's all kind of intersected at a point where you saw some extreme weakness when multiple pipes went down. At the end of the day, I think, a big up would be El Paso coming back online. And then as the PHP and Marathon expansions come online -- the PHP and Whistler come online, sorry, and then Marathon comes online in 2024. I think we'll see the basin get a lot better. I think we have spent a lot of time preparing for that. Our group has been through this before. And I think we see a line of sight to target being able to operate all our assets at the capacity we will need through that period of time. As for Targa and long-haul gas pipelines, we want to say no, we'll keep saying that. We'll always say that. If it takes us participating, we're always wanting to participate. If other people get them done and gas gets out of the basin, and bottoms out basis we're excited to see that too. So I think we always stand by and stand ready for what's needed, because what we want to be is the gas costs that our plans keep operating our NGLs go through our system. 
Keith Stanley : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays. 
Theresa Chen : Hi, there. I wanted to ask on the comments related to the carbon capture opportunities and your anticipation of receiving 45Q credit. Can you provide some more detail on the nature of the economics with these projects in general and your outlook from here?
Robert Muraro : So I think -- this is Bobby, sorry. We look at them like we do our kind of traditional economics around the rest of our system. So it's not that we have specific hurdles, but we have thresholds of which the team here wants to invest capital in projects. And what I'd tell you is in looking at our carbon capture projects prior to the updated 45Q, they were economic. And as we get to the new and better 45Q credit that we will get and make them that much better. So we don't comment on specific projects and specific returns, but these projects went from economic in our view under traditional ways we run economics to just that much better when the new 45Q came out. So it's got to -- I won't say it's accelerated our thinking, but it makes us more intention about making sure we get all these done. 
Jen Kneale : And then related to timing, Theresa, we said in our script accounts that we thought that we could start getting credits as early as Q4 of 2023.
Theresa Chen : Got it. And in relation to your LPG exports just curious as to why you have confidence that it will rebound and get better in the fourth quarter. Just given the pervasive downstream headwinds at your customers both Asia and Europe, I imagine. And then also, can you remind us around what percentage of volumes you have currently contracted at this point?
Scott Pryor: Hey, Theresa, this is Scott. First off, just to reiterate our volumes were 8.5 million barrels per month during the quarter. That was down obviously from what we saw in the second quarter. But it was comparative to what really the industry saw as a whole roughly down about 15% quarter-over-quarter when you look at the exports out of the US to various markets across the globe. A lot of that was driven by just as you stated weaker global markets. Some of that related to Asian ethylene producers where they were faced with really some unattractive economics relative to the co-products and products they produce on that side of the business. And thus they cut some of their LPG usage as a result of that. We also saw some slowdowns in China due to some areas that may have been impacted by COVID shutdowns and things of that nature which slowed up some of the PDH plant activity. But in general, I would say the reason why we feel as though the volumes would look better in the fourth quarter is because where we sit today, what has been lifted thus far, what is on our schedule for the balance of the fourth quarter. That's why we feel comfortable stating that our volumes will be up in the fourth quarter. With that said, we're still going to be facing some global market issues that are weaker at this point, shipping issues and things of that nature as well as conducting some scheduled maintenance that we have -- that we need to do in the fourth quarter. But again, overall we would believe at this point that our volumes will be up in the fourth quarter.
Theresa Chen: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal from Seaport Global.
Sunil Sibal: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for all the clarity. So when I look at the base G&P business obviously, it seems like you have some impact of the inflation on your fees as well as on your OpEx. So I was just curious from here on should we consider that most of those inflation adjust has kicked in and that are incorporated in the 3Q results, or should we expect any significant movements in that?
Jen Kneale: Sunil, this is Jen. I'd say that across our entire portfolio of contracts, most of the escalators have kicked in for this year. We've talked previously about the fact that we have a number of contracts that essentially kick in January 1, then a number of contracts that kick in midyear and then there are some others that I'd say is more the minority that kick in on the annual renewal date of the contract or based on some other date during the calendar year. So yes, I think it's fair to say that we have benefited from the escalators that we would expect this year. And then heading into 2023 of course will be a net beneficiary of escalators as we move forward through into next year.
Sunil Sibal: Got it. And then could you give us a sense of ethane rejection across your Permian footprint? And what trends do you expect to play out in the near term on that?
Pat McDonie: I'm not sure I fully heard the question.
Jen Kneale: Ethane rejection in the Permian and trends. 
Pat McDonie: The natural gas takeaway situation is going to play into that pretty heavily right. If you can't move residue gas, then probably more barrels are going to be pulled -- more is going to be recovered than rejected adding incremental MMBTUs into a tight gas market is going to be problematic. So, I think one first it's always an economic decision and it will continue to be an economic decision. And then some of those other dynamics relative to the ability to move residue gas. And obviously, if that price gets really low, which we've seen recently relative to ethane price, I think you'll see recoveries and ethane being transported to Belvieu. 
Sunil Sibal: Okay, got it. Thanks.
Jen Kneale: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra from Bank of America.
Neel Mitra: Hi, good morning. I just had a few follow-ups on Daytona. First is it going to twin Grand Prix or are you going to maybe have it go a different direction in some places so it can access new processing facilities. And then the second part of that is it limited to 400,000 cubic feet a day because of the limitation on the 30-inch pipe from North Texas to Mont Belvieu? 
Scott Pryor: Hey Neel, this is Scott Pryor. First off the way you need to view Daytona is basically a loop of the existing Grand Prix West leg, albeit we will be taking advantage of the lines that move further west both in Texas as well as into New Mexico that Grand Prix system today will help feed both the Grand Prix West as well as the Daytona system. So, it will run virtually parallel of the Grand Prix West system tying into our 30-inch leg in North Texas what we refer to as our junction point which is just south of Dallas Texas. It allows us to leverage capacity that we have on the 30-inch pipeline. And when we say that it has an initial capacity of 400,000 barrels a day it's similar to how we said Grand Prix West had initial capacity of roughly 400,000 barrels a day when it first started up but we have put pumps on to amp that up to call it 550,000 barrels a day. We would have the same ability to do that with Daytona. So, we're taking advantage of where all of our plant activity is in the permit. So it will have the ability to again feed both Grand Prix West as well as Daytona and again take advantage of that line out of North Texas feeding into Mont Belvieu. So, it lines up very well with where our concentration of plant activity is.
Neel Mitra: And if I could just follow-up on that. It seemed like $9.50 is that the limitation from North Texas to Mont Belvieu, or could you get more capacity with pumps? 
Scott Pryor: Yes. I would -- we have had a cadence of where we've been putting on pumps both on the West leg as well as the South Lake to complement the volumes that are coming from West as well as in North Texas and up into Oklahoma. I would call it nominally one million barrels per day of capacity on the 30-inch leg going into Mont Belvieu.
Neel Mitra: Okay. Great. And then just the second question, it seems like you've had some commercial success Wildcat II and Winkler to second. Wildcat plant you brought on in the last four years in the legacy Delaware. Could you just comment on the customer mix, or private public and activity you're seeing in that area to cause you to go forward with that project? 
Pat McDonie: Sure. It is a mix as you described. We have a big chunk of the majors, dedication on both of those systems. And certainly -- if you think about the Delaware Basin, there's been acquisitions recently by majors that have gobbled up some of the smaller guys. So that has added to their portfolio, which is dedicated up under us. And then we have a ton of mid- to smaller guys that are extremely active, that some of which we've done business with a long time, and some of which as you described we've had commercial success with and added to our portfolio.
Neel Mitra: Okay. Got it. Thank you very much
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of John McKay from Goldman Sachs. 
John McKay: Hi. Thanks for the time. I wanted to pick up on that last piece. You guys are showing really a much better volume outlook than a lot of your peers in the midstream side are talking about. And we've seen a couple of the producers starting to slow down. I was just wondering, if you could spend another minute maybe just talking about kind of, what's differentiating your footprint what kind of giving you guys a confidence on the growth outlook and whether or not you have seen a little bit of slowdown from your producer customers?
Pat McDonie: I'll address the last part, first. This is Pat McDonie. We really haven't seen an appreciable slowdown. The people have employed rigs continue to employ them and just move them across their acreage and continue to drill. Certainly, we've been fortunate that a lot of those rigs are running on our acreage. But I would tell you that, our infrastructure underpins a lot of the best acreage in the Delaware Basin and also obviously in the Midland Basin, as seen by many years of history. You've seen the –Acorns [ph] the Chevrons the big guys come out and announce what their plans are for next year. And there's no appreciable slowdown from them, just their public information is available and Chevron is actually adding rigs. Our smaller guys the economics are very good, and they continue to stay active. So we have not seen a slowdown. There certainly has been some logistical constraints, that have a time made debt ponds a little bit lumpy. In other words, waiting on completion crews et cetera, but the wells are still getting drilled, eventually getting completed. So I can't speak to our competitors or our peers. But certainly, we're seeing a continued level of high activity. 
John McKay: I appreciate that. Maybe picking up on that one comment from earlier too, I think Theresa's question. Just back to the exports, have you guys commented on what your contracted levels are? 
Jen Kneale: John, I'm sorry we could not hear a word of that. 
John McKay: I'll try again. Just circling back to Theresa's question on the exports. Have you guys commented, where your current contracted level set? 
Jen Kneale: I'm sorry John. We couldn't hear a word of that. Either jump back in and you try from a different line.
John Mackay: I’ll follow-up offline.
Jen Kneale: Okay. We’ll follow-up offline. Perfect. Thank you. Sorry about that.
John Mackay: Thank you. Sorry about that.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cusimano from Pickering Energy Partners.
Michael Cusimano: Hi. Good morning. I just have a few follow-ups from some of the questions that have been asked. First, Jen, I appreciate the help on the hedge exposure. Specifically, in regards to Waha, though, should we think about any weighting throughout the year for how those hedges are on? I guess, I'm thinking are the first three quarters more heavily weighted for that basis than the back fourth quarter. And is that 80% an annual average?
Jen Kneale: The percent that I gave would be annual averages for next year, Michael. And then the way that we generally hedge is, there can be some shaping where there's more hedged earlier in the year than later in the year. But, I'd say, that for next year, it's actually all pretty ratable at this point in time on the gas side.
Michael Cusimano: Okay. That's helpful. And then on the ethane rejection that you experienced, is it fair to assume that that was in the Mid-Con with the volumes a little bit lower quarter-to-quarter? And then, a follow-on for that. Can we assume that the West leg of the Grand Prix line grew similar to what volumes did? Just how do we think about that? 
Jen Kneale: This is Jen. Related to the Mid-Con we actually had a contract expiration that we called out in South Oak and so that's part of what resulted in the volumes there being lower quarter-over-quarter. It was really in the Permian and a little bit elsewhere that we are making decisions around rejection recovery based on what we were seeing related to some of the maintenance issues on certain pipes and pricing around natural gas and ethane.
Michael Cusimano: Okay. Got it. And then, lastly, can you remind us the typical cadence spend for just your standard processing plant, if it's a fourth quarter lead time, how that typically looks and if there's any nuance to the ongoing processing plants that you're working on?
Jen Kneale: It depends. Each plant is a little bit different based on whether there's additional treating infrastructure or what else is required, if it's plumbed close to the structure or not. So, again, each plant is a little bit different. I'd say that generally the spend is across the life of the project prior to it coming online. So there isn't significant lumpiness for Wildcat II, for example, that would be hitting this quarter. But then as we move into 2023, you wouldn't see continued spending. So I'd say that, for modeling purposes, it's easiest and probably most accurate just to assume ratable spending from now until a project comes online.
Michael Cusimano: Okay. That’s really helpful. That’s all for me. Appreciate the help.
Jen Kneale: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Sanjay Lad for closing remarks.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks to everyone that was on the call this morning and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Targa Resources Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sanjay Lad, Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks, Cole. Good morning, and welcome to the second quarter 2022 earnings call for Targa Resources Corp. The second quarter earnings release, along with the second quarter earnings supplement presentation for Targa Resources that accompany our call are available on our website at targaresources.com in the Investors section. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. Statements made during this call that might include Targa Resources' expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings. Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer; and Jen Kneale, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, the following senior management team members will be available for Q&A. Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Matt.
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning. This is an exciting time for our company. And given the recent close of our Delaware Basin acquisition, I want to take this opportunity to publicly welcome our new colleagues to the Targa team. I would also like to thank all of our employees for their collective efforts as it has been a very busy first seven months of 2022, and the team has already accomplished a lot. And our strong execution continued across the second quarter, including record-high quarterly EBITDA, record volumes in the Permian, record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes, redemption of Series A preferred stock, completing the successful sale of our interest in Gulf Coast Express Pipeline, integration of our acquired South Texas assets, successful negotiation of our Delaware Basin acquisition and subsequent financing and $74 million of common share repurchases. Looking ahead, continuing to execute on our strategic priorities will drive increasing EBITDA, reduced common share count, a higher common dividend while maintaining leverage within our target range. Our performance this year has been strong, and we expect that to continue. We are updating our financial guidance for the year to account for the completion of the Delaware Basin acquisition effective August 1. We now estimate full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.85 billion and $2.95 billion. We continue to expect volumes to grow across both our Permian Midland and Delaware positions for the remainder of the year and well beyond. We have several gas plants under construction, Legacy I and Legacy II in the Permian Midland and Midway and Red Hill IV in the Permian Delaware. And given our line of sight to increasing G&P volume growth, we are continuing to invest across our NGL business. We are announcing two new projects, a new 275 million cubic feet per day processing plant in the Permian Midland, which we are calling the Greenwood plant; and a new 120,000 barrel per day Train 9 fractionator in Mont Belvieu. Investing in organic growth projects across our integrated footprint provides Targa with attractive returns and puts us in a strong position to continue to return capital to our shareholders. Turning to our Delaware Basin acquisition and our combined Permian Basin footprint. On a combined basis, we now have about 2.8 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity in the Permian Delaware, complementing our 3.6 Bcf per day processing position in the Permian Midland for a combined total of 6.4 Bcf per day of processing capacity. Our assets in the Delaware Basin overlay some of the most economic acreage in North America with the acquisition, increasing our size and scale by extending our reach into the highly active and productive Eddy and Lea counties of New Mexico. We now have several million acres dedicated to us across the Permian Basin, providing decades of future activity that will result in increasing volumes moving across our integrated assets. We acquired the Delaware Basin assets at an attractive 7.5x multiple of estimated 2023 EBITDA and expect volume growth as well as near- and long-term synergies to reduce the acquisition multiple. We expect to capture downstream synergies over time as existing contracts come up for renewal and from new Targa processing expansions. We funded the acquisition with cash on hand and debt and expect to end the year with leverage around 3.5x, comfortably around the midpoint of our 3x to 4x long-term leverage target ratio. Let's now discuss our operations in more detail. Starting in the Permian, our systems across the Midland and Delaware Basins continue to perform well, averaging a record 3.1 Bcf per day reported inlet volume during the second quarter. In Permian Midland, our systems continue to run full, and we expect to bring online our next 275 Mmcf per day Legacy I plant later this month, which is expected to come online highly utilized. A special thanks to our engineering and operations teams for working diligently and safely to bring Legacy online ahead of schedule. Our Legacy II plant in Permian Midland remains on track to begin operations during the second quarter of 2023, and we similarly expect it to be highly utilized when it comes online. In Permian Delaware, volumes across our system are also continuing to ramp. Our new 230 million a day Red Hills VI plant is expected online in September. And our new 275 million a day Midway plant is expected to begin operations during the third quarter of 2023. We expect Red Hills VI to essentially be full when it comes online, and we have flexibility across our Permian Delaware system to handle additional near-term production growth from Eddy and Lea counties with connections to Targa plants. Shifting to the Badlands. Late winter storms impacted our natural gas and crude gathering volumes for the second quarter, but volumes have since rebounded. In our Central region, the acquired assets in South Texas and an uptick in activity levels in Oklahoma and North Texas drove a sequential increase in volumes during the second quarter. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. NGL transportation volumes were a record 492,000 barrels per day to Mont Belvieu during the second quarter. Throughput volumes sequentially increased 7% driven by increasing NGL production from Targa's Permian plants and third parties. Fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex during the second quarter were a record 737,000 barrels per day, and the fractionation market in Mont Belvieu continues to tighten. We are moving forward with Train 9 given our outlook for continued supply growth from our Permian G&P systems and third parties. Train 9 is fully permitted and is expected to begin operations during the second quarter of 2024 with an estimated cost of around $450 million. In our LPG export services business at Galena Park, we loaded an average of 10.4 million barrels per month during the second quarter, providing a consistent outlook for our customers despite continued volatility in global commodity markets. We continue to expect to complete our previously announced low-cost expansion project to increase our propane loading capabilities with an incremental 1 million barrels per month of capacity by mid-2023. Lastly, year-to-date, we have purchased almost 2.4 million common shares at a cost of around $154 million. Our balance sheet is strong. We are continuing to invest in our business, both organically and through acquisitions. We are returning an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders, and we are excited about Targa's outlook. Before I turn the call over to Jen, I would like to extend a final thank you to our employees for their continued focus on safety while executing on our strategic priorities and continuing to provide best-in-class services to our customers. Jen?
Jen Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $666.4 million, increasing 6% sequentially as we benefited from higher commodity prices and higher volumes across our gathering and processing and logistics and transportation systems, partially offset by lower marketing margin and higher operating expenses. Higher operating expenses were primarily attributable to increasing activity levels across our G&P systems, our recently acquired assets in South Texas and inflation. While costs are higher, inflation continues to be a net tailwind for us across our businesses as we benefit from inflation-linked fee escalators across our commercial contracts. Targa generated adjusted free cash flow of $334 million in the second quarter. During the second quarter, we completed the redemption of all of our outstanding Series A preferred stock for approximately $973 million and also received the proceeds associated with the sale of our interest in Gulf Coast Express pipeline of $857 million. Our consolidated net leverage ratio was 3.1x at the end of the second quarter, and we had about $2.3 billion of available liquidity. We repurchased about $74 million of common shares in the second quarter and repurchased an additional $30 million during July. We have approximately $215 million remaining under our $500 million repurchase program. Since the inception of our common share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2020, we have opportunistically repurchased $285 million of common shares or about 8.6 million shares at an average price of $33.12. We continue to expect to pay a common dividend per share of $1.40 for 2022 with our next dividend increase likely to be announced in early 2023, concurrent with when we expect to provide 2023 operational and financial guidance. Throughout the year, we have added hedges and we are significantly hedged for the balance of 2022. We have also continued to add 2023 hedges at higher weighted average hedge prices than 2022. It has been a very active couple of months for the finance team as we were able to attractively finance our Delaware Basin acquisition through a combination of five-year and 30-year senior notes issued in the investment-grade market, a three-year term loan and availability under our revolver. Pro forma for the acquisition, we have about $1.1 billion of liquidity available on our revolver. Benefiting from now being an investment-grade issuer, we also recently entered into a commercial paper program. As Matt mentioned, we are updating our financial estimates to account for a partial year contribution from the Delaware Basin acquisition and now estimate full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.85 billion and $2.95 billion and continue to estimate a year-end leverage ratio of around 3.5x. With the addition of spending in 2022 for the Greenwood plant and Train 9 announced today, plus spending to support the newly acquired Delaware Basin assets, we now estimate 2022 net growth CapEx to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. Our estimate for 2022 net maintenance CapEx remains unchanged at approximately $150 million. Our continued investment in growing Targa's underlying businesses, supported by solid business fundamentals and the strength of our balance sheet means we are in excellent position looking forward to continue to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. Lastly, I'd like to echo Matt and thank our employees for their dedication and for continuing to prioritize safety. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks, Jen. [Operator Instructions] Cole, would you please open the line for Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Just wanted to dive into capital allocation thoughts a bit more. Big spend this year with the acquisition and all. But as you start to look into '23, it seems like there's a lot of available cash flow. And I just wanted to kind of get your thoughts with where you see that landing. It seems like the opportunity for buybacks would only increase. And when you think about buybacks, is it more price sensitive to the stock? Or is it more balance sheet capacity that drives time and buybacks?
Matt Meloy: Yes. Jeremy, we really are in a good position where we're going to have a lot of flexibility as we move through this year with strong EBITDA growth and then as we get into 2023, expecting continued growth in our business. I think we'll continue to focus on investing organically, which is driving some of the really good returns for Targa and then really increasing our ability to return more capital to shareholders over time. But we'll have a lot of flexibility in 2023 to increase that return of capital to shareholders. So this fall, we'll discuss with our Board what the right dividend level is. We'll kind of look at our peers. We'll look at broader industry peers, S&P 400, 500 and then come up with a recommendation for a dividend. That will be one piece of the equation. And then we'll also look at continuing our share buybacks. You've seen us actually ramp that up here even in light of the Lucid acquisition. We've been increasing our share buybacks. I would still like to say that it is an opportunistic program. I don't see us just setting a level and say it's going to be this. We're going to look at the macro environment. We'll look at our organic growth projects, where we set our dividend and then come up with a plan that makes sense but have flexibility in that such that if we see some good opportunities to increase that, then we can do so.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. And just wanted to kind of clarify two points there as my follow-up. When you think about the dividend, is it relative to midstream peers or more kind of like S&P 500? And I guess there's concern in the marketplace with regards to this much free cash flow coming out next year and whether that be returned to shareholders or put to M&A. I'm just wondering any thoughts you could provide on that.
Matt Meloy: Yes. I think as we look to the dividend, we will look towards broader industry peers. We will be informed by what our midstream peers do. We'll take a look at that. But I think we talked about when we moved our dividend to $1.40, having modest growth. We certainly have the ability to do that and a lot of flexibility and the ability to do more if we so desire to do more than modest growth. That will be a discussion with our Board. Either way, we're going to prioritize financial flexibility as we go forward to continue to invest in our business organically. And then I view M&A kind of similar to how we've talked about it. I think we continue to have a high bar for M&A. We need something that's going to put us in a really strong position coming out of the other side of the M&A with both the Southcross and the Lucid acquisitions. Our balance sheet is strong. We reported 3.1x leverage ratio. We're estimating 3.5x by year-end. So we want to make sure we have a strong balance sheet if we do any M&A. I'd say right now with as active as we've been this year, our focus is going to be on integrating those acquisitions and making sure we do those well and extract the synergies that we think we can get from those acquisitions. So I think our focus is going to be on integration here for a little while, even while we have significant cash flow to invest in our business organically and then increase return of capital to shareholders.
Operator: Our next question will come from Brian Reynolds with UBS.
Brian Reynolds: I was curious if you could just a little bit on commodity exposure post the recent Lucid acquisition and how we should think about the evolving kind of 60-40 G&P logistics and transportation earnings mix over time. Is it kind of fair to assume that we should see growth in fee-based in the L&T business going forward relative to G&P and POP exposure?
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure. Our commodity exposure with Lucid really being, I'd say, entirely fee-based contract. There still is some embedded commodity exposure in there with just the way those contracts are settled, but it's primarily fee-based. So all things equal, that's going to marginally increase our fee-based margin over time. As we look at that mix, what's G&P and what's downstream, we kind of think of it more as we're going to continue to invest in both of those businesses. It's an integrated business. We're going to invest in G&P. And we're going to invest like we are with Train 9 and the export dock as needed to handle those volumes. And then -- so the mix is just going to kind of be a result of investing in our integrated platform. To the extent we get higher commodity prices and we move above our fee floors, then it ends up shifting a little bit more margin into our G&P business. That's really a result of just excess earnings and having a higher commodity price environment. So we don't have a target we're going for. We're just going to continue to invest in both businesses. That said, we see increasing fee-based margin just on an absolute basis continuing to grow. We're going to continue to have growth in our G&P business from fees. We're going to continue to have fee-based margin increase in our downstream business from fees.
Jen Kneale: And we'll also continue to look to add fee-based elements or floors to any existing contracts where we don't already have those particularly as contracts come up for expiration or there's some catalyst to be able to renegotiate those contracts. So that will also help provide additional cash flow stability on the downside going forward.
Brian Reynolds: Great. I appreciate all that incremental color. Maybe as my one follow-up, the Lucid acquisition appeared to include some carbon and GC waste capabilities. Just given the recent 45Q credit increase included in Inflation Reduction Act proposal, how should we think about the potential opportunity set for Targa as the largest processor in Permian?
Matt Meloy: Yes. Thank you. We have been working prior to Lucid, just on working on carbon capture to see if there's something we can commercialize across our Permian footprint. Lucid has made really good progress on that as well. And so I'd say I'm excited about the opportunity to be able to develop that, both in the Delaware and on the Midland side. They have some really good people over there who are really smart and knowledgeable about how to do this. And yes, you're right, with the 45Q, if that gets passed, increasing it makes those projects easier to get over the finish line. So I think with their expertise plus the work that we have done, it kind of increases our ability to commercialize that opportunity.
Operator: And our next question will come from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.
Keith Stanley: I guess to start just on Lucid synergies. Can you talk a little more about near-term, long-term opportunities and how impactful it might be? I guess near term, you referenced potentially shifting some Lucid volumes if it's above your capacity onto other Targa assets. Just any color along those lines and how you're thinking about that over time.
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure. We think near term, there will be some synergies on the NGL side but just moving some volumes over to excess capacity we have out in our Far West Delaware processing plants. We have excess capacity. Lucid is running overcapacity. And so when we -- they're already tied together. We're actually working on putting in some more pipes to expand the capability to move more gas to and from. So some near term, just from what we call offloads on to our existing Targa system that then pushes those liquids down Grand Prix. And we expect over time as we add processing plants, those processing plants will be undedicated. We'll be able to capture some of those volumes and move those into our downstream business. That's another opportunity. And then as existing NGL dedications roll off over time, we'll be able to move those on to it as well. So I'd say there are some short term, some medium term and then some longer term where it's contracted or tied up. So I think it will be similar to how we think about that from our previous acquisitions we have done, it's going to be kind of a gradual increase in the ability for us to capture those liquids versus probably a cliff or just a really large amount coming all at one day. It's going to be a gradual move of NGLs onto our system over time.
Keith Stanley: Great. And second question, just with the Inflation Reduction Act. Jen, can you just give an update on when you expect the Company to be a material cash taxpayer and how that bill is currently written could impact the Company?
Jen Kneale: So currently, Keith, it depends on ultimately what our earnings and profits are and the amount of growth capital spending that we undertake. But our current assumption is that we wouldn't really pay any cash taxes of any material amount until 2024, and then it would ramp from there. So it's probably, call it, 2027 before we've worked our way through our existing NOL. And then again, that could be shifting depending on growth capital spending, et cetera. With the Inflation Reduction Act, we could potentially be paying a minimum tax in 2024. But that would really be available -- those taxes would then be available to reduce regular income taxes in the future. So it would really create more of a timing shift of when we pay cash taxes versus anything else.
Operator: Our next question will come from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering & Holt.
Colton Bean: So I apologize in advance for a few bundled questions here. But it looks like Grand Prix reached nearly 500,000 barrels a day during Q2. So one, can you frame the mix between Permian and Mid-Con? And then two, to the extent that Permian utilization continues to climb as new plants come online, is there any ability to push beyond that 550,000 barrel a day upside capacity? And if not, what sort of lead time would you need to loop the line to the 30-inch interconnect in North Texas?
Scott Pryor: Colton, this is Scott. I'll start it off and see if Matt has some other comments that he would want to add. But I would just say that we've not described exactly what the mix is from the West leg of our Grand Prix pipeline versus the Northern leg coming from Conway and in through the Kingfisher connection that we've got with the Williams pipeline with Bluestem. But it is a contributor to that, and that is one contributor that will grow over time as existing contracts with some of our customers roll off with competitors and those volumes roll on to us. We're certainly aware of the need of the west leg that we have today. And we are continuing to add pumps where it's necessary to pump up that pipeline. We are always evaluating what the needs are relative to increasing over and above maybe the 550,000 barrel limit that we have kind of stated publicly. And then we are obviously evaluating what the needs are to add additional transportation needs out of the Permian. It is our goal as we add gas processing plants in the Permian, both -- whether it's with the Delaware acquisition that we recently did or new plants on the Midland side, our goal is to make sure that those volumes run along our transportation legs, whether it's current Grand Prix pipeline or future expansions that we may do.
Colton Bean: Great. Maybe just on that last piece, any early expectations around what sort of lead time you would need to be able to loop the line to that larger interconnect?
Matt Meloy: Yes. So we are working through that. We've got a number of processing plants underway now that are going to add significant liquids to us. We still have a fair amount of capacity that gives us a lot of lead time to be able to capture those. So I'd say right now, we're kind of working through looking at the timing of our transportation volume in the build and kind of evaluating when the right time to add additional transportation capacity is. So that's kind of something we're actively working on. And so just kind of -- we'll have to just kind of look at that as we go forward.
Colton Bean: Got it. And then just switching over to the G&P segment. A fairly material step-up in OpEx Q-on-Q. Any detail on the trajectory you're expecting here through the balance of the year?
Jen Kneale: Colton, this is Jen. I think you should expect an increased Q3 relative to Q2 just as a result of the Lucid acquisition. We are seeing inflation across our businesses on the cost side in terms of chemical costs and things like that. I think our teams are doing a really good job of trying to manage through that, but costs are higher. And then just as activity levels increase, that also results in higher costs as well. And we certainly have an expectation of activity levels on the G&P side continuing to increase rest of this year, both Delaware Basin plus standalone Targa.
Operator: And our next question will come from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.
Danny Peak: This is Danny Peak on filling in for Neal today. My first question is really about on expansion. You guys have some attractive plants and attracting areas coming online. Do you guys see any material demand for additional products? And if so, which region would you say is the strongest?
Matt Meloy: Sorry, just to clarify, you say regional demand for products? Or are you kind of just referring to fractionation demand, is that...
Danny Peak: Yes. That's correct, yes.
Matt Meloy: Okay. As I kind of said in the scripted comments, we do see a tight frac market. Our volumes have ramped. A lot of the competitors' volumes, third parties volumes have ramped. So we're seeing a lot of wide-grade hit Belvieu. And so that market is tightening up. A lot of that is coming from the Permian from growth. A lot of it is also coming with some operational upsets we've had in the industry coming from other areas as well. So that's causing to kind of tighten up a bit. We still have some flexibility with our fractionation complex with Train 7 and 8 coming on and giving us some excess capacity. We have flexibility in Lake Charles. And we also are looking at what the right timing for a GCF potential restart is. So we're kind of sorting through that. So I think we'll be able to provide some outlets for that increased Y grade. But it is tightening up, and we do expect it to be tight for a while.
Danny Peak: Okay. Great. And my last question is on capital allocation. Specifically, is there a leverage level where you would become more aggressive with stock buybacks? I know you guys are at your midpoint or expecting to be at your midpoint by year-end. But can you give any color on that? That will be it for me.
Jen Kneale: This is Jen. I think it's easier to be more aggressive if your leverage ratio is trending towards the lower end of your long-term leverage target range. But that may not be when the best opportunity presents itself in the market. So if you rewind it back to October of 2020, when we put the repurchase program in place, I wouldn't say that we had our leverage where we wanted it to be. But we saw a unique opportunity in the market to go and repurchase shares. And so we stepped into that. I'd expect that it's an important part of how we'll return capital going forward. The most important element of how we want to manage the profile of the Company is with maintaining a very strong balance sheet. So if our balance sheet is strong, which we really believe is within that long-term leverage target range of 3x to 4x, with a preference for that leverage ratio to be the bottom end of that range, I think you'll see us continue to have the flexibility to be active. And then it will just be a matter of what opportunity do we see presented in the market.
Operator: And our next question will come from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.
Chase Mulvehill: I guess the first question is really just coming back to Permian processing capacity. Obviously, we've seen a lot of announcements recently for a lot of your peers adding processing capacity in the Permian. So if we kind of think about that and relative to yours, I think you got about 1.2 b a day of incremental capacity that you to bring online by the end of next year. Could you talk about the confidence you have of filling that? Would you bring those plants online?
Matt Meloy: Sure. Chase, yes. No, we've got a lot -- I mean we run five plants right now across the Permian. I'd say we feel just kind of starting with the nearest term ones, we feel really good about those being full. I think Legacy I and Red Hills are both going to be highly utilized really the day they turn on. We are running absolutely full in the Midland. And it was actually over full in the Delaware on the Lucid asset. So I think those are going to be full kind of day 1. And when you go to the Midway plant, that is a partial -- that's a replacement. We're going to be idling the Sand Hills plant. So we'll move those volumes over and then have available for growth there. So most of that is going to be utilized just from the Sand Hills volumes day 1. And so then that leaves two more processing plants in the Midland Basin. We've added a number of plants in the Permian Midland. And it's really been the same story for us as soon as we bring it on with the flush production coming from kind of lowering overall field pressures plus the growth. We feel very optimistic we're going to be able to have those highly utilized when they come on and then fill up very quickly. So I think really, the next question becomes when do we need more -- what's the cadence beyond that. We feel like hopefully, with -- on the Midland side with adding Legacy II and adding Greenwood, maybe that gives us a little bit of time. But I think we'll be quickly looking at the Delaware for when we're going to need another plant out there. So I think we're more thinking about when we're going to need another one as opposed to are we going to be able to fill the ones we've announced.
Chase Mulvehill: Well, good to hear. And then can I ask on Waha basis real quick. Obviously, there's some risk of widening out kind of 2Q, 3Q or maybe even before next year. I'm just kind of curious on kind of your thoughts on the risk -- more just the basis risk than the volume risk. But the basis risk that you have out there and maybe how much you kind of hedged of that risk?
Matt Meloy: Sure. Yes, I'd say our risk out there is we want to make sure that we can flow the volume. So when Waha tightens out, if it gets difficult moving it out, we want to make sure that we can move it. So we've been active at taking out transportation and making sure we can get the volumes away from our plant and to market. As far as the overall Waha basis risk, our length in natural gas, when we hedge, we hedge it at Waha. So really, what we want is kind of an absolute higher Waha price versus a whole lot of exposure to the spread. So we want absolute Waha prices to be high. We want to make sure we can get volumes out.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. Makes sense. I'll respect the two questions. And hopefully, somebody will ask about Medford.
Matt Meloy: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question will come from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities.
Sunil Sibal: So I wanted to start off on the capital side of things. So obviously, you've raised 2022 budget. I was kind of curious how should we be thinking about puts and takes for the 2023 capital spend. You obviously have outlined a few expansion projects. So from that perspective, what kind of cost inflation you're seeing? And then how should we be thinking about the '23 budget?
Jen Kneale: Sunil, this is Jen. For 2022, we've really accelerated projects that were in our five-year plan, but just we need them sooner given the visibility that we have to volume growth when you think about Train 9 spending shifting into 2022. Think about Greenwood spending shifting into 2022. And then the adder would be the Delaware Basin acquisition and the continued build-out of those assets. As we look into 2023, I think that part of what will impact our growth capital budget for next year will be potential spending on next plants, whether that be on the Delaware side or the next plant needed on the Greenwood side. But I'd expect that we will be spending capital at levels very much commiserate with the size of the Company. And so as we've gotten bigger, we just have more flexibility capacity to spend more. But we also don't have a lot of visibility to what I call additional large projects beyond those that we've already announced other than incremental processing expansions, a looping or other project associated with Grand Prix and NGL transportation down the road. That would be the one that just depending on what we're seeing on volume growth. The next large project that we have on the radar screen and the timing of that, again, will be dependent on the continued growth of NGL transport volumes.
Sunil Sibal: Just to clarify. So what you're saying is that unless you announce more projects, you should see a bit of a step-down in '23 CapEx based on all that you announced?
Jen Kneale: I don't know if I'd say that we'll see a step down. We'll provide formal guidance in February, typical with our time frame of when we provide CapEx guidance for the following year. We do have some spending that's shifting into this year and that spending on frac Train 9 that otherwise may have occurred next year. We've got spending on Greenwood shifting into this year that otherwise may have occurred next year. But I think we're very comfortable with spending around these levels. And then ultimately, it's our visibility to increasing volume growth and where the next pinch point is within our asset footprint that will result in us needing to move forward with the next project. I'd say that there isn't something large looming out there that would have a material impact on growth capital spending at this point in time.
Sunil Sibal: Got it. And then my second question was related to the IRA. I understand that there are some provisions in that with regard to limiting methane emissions from processing facilities. So I was curious if you had a chance to look through that. And how do you think that impacts your footprint? You've obviously highlighted plans to reduce methane emissions. But does your plans kind of tie in with new requirements in IRA. Or how should we think about that?
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure. So our -- yes, our ES&H group has been really active at kind of evaluating what that methane tax or what the regulations could entail. We actually were looking at it quite a bit in the last round this came about. We took a look at it. We are focused on reducing our emissions, improving our intensity. We have a lot of projects that we're moving forward with to try and reduce that. So we'll -- we're very good at compliance, very good at meeting rules and regulations. And I think our ES&H Group is up to the task on that. And we'll see what the ultimate -- what the fee or what all the operating parameters are for setting those limits and everything else. So it's early. We'll have to see what ultimately gets passed. But I'd say we are actively focused on it, working on it and we'll perform very well.
Operator: And our next question will come from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs.
John Mackay: I wanted to start on L&T. You guys touched a little bit on marketing being weak. But just given how strong volumes were, could you just talk a little bit about what's going on this quarter? Was it a kind of one-off on margin dipping? Or is this kind of the run rate unit margins that we should think about going forward?
Scott Pryor: I would -- first off, I would say, John, that we had a very strong first quarter as it relates to some of our marketing and optimization around that, not quite as active in the second quarter. And that's -- that would be somewhat seasonal and typical for us when we roll into the second quarter. With that said, when we look at the growth that we've had on the fractionation volume side, obviously, record volumes there. We've had increased volumes flowing down our transportation assets in and through Mont Belvieu. So we've seen some nice increases on that. And then our export business continues to be very consistent, quarter in and quarter out. Obviously, with pricing the way that it is today, with the backwardation that we're seeing across really the U.S. pricing as well as international pricing, that presents itself some challenges. But all in all, with the volume growth that we're seeing on our G&P side of the ledger, those volumes are going to be steered toward our transportation assets to our fractionation footprint. We're going to continue to see volumes increase over time. So we feel very comfortable where we sit. Obviously, we've got a lot of work to do as it relates to our announcement around Trade 9 and bringing those -- bringing that fractionation train back on. And we see opportunities there just to continue to grow with the volumes.
John Mackay: All right. Maybe just unpacking a little bit of what you said there, just in terms of the export business. We've seen some softness in petchem demand overall. Maybe you can just share kind of where you see that sitting right now and how that should trend for the rest of the year.
Scott Pryor: From an international perspective, is that what you're referring to?
John Mackay: Yes, for the export business.
Scott Pryor: Well, again, from our volumes, we've seen consistency quarter in and quarter out. There has probably been more of a challenge on the butane export side of the business. Some of that's related for backwardation, again, that we're seeing on propane as well as butane. But internationally, yes, it's been a little bit more -- a little tougher on the butane side. Spreads have been compressed. We have also seen that internationally, butane prices are actually trailing behind propane prices. And so when you look at the risk of waterborne traders, when you look at the consumption overseas, obviously, dealing with potential issues just with the economies, we'll be facing some challenges. We feel very comfortable, though, with our term contracts. We've not had any cancellations across our dock. So we, again, believe that we'll see consistency with that. We feel very comfortable also with our expansion that will come online mid next year, adding some additional flexibility. So all in all, I think the cadence of our export business looks very smooth relative to overall expansions that we're doing across our entire downstream business that complements our upstream side.
Operator: And our next question will come from Michael Cusimano with Pickering Energy Partners.
Michael Cusimano: On my numbers for '22, you have realized almost $300 million of hedge losses year-to-date on the G&P system. And disclosures are kind of stale, but my math shows a couple of hundred remaining for the rest of the year. So I was hoping you could talk about '23 hedges. We're not sure where they're priced necessarily. But given the recent commodity weakness, are those looking like potentially even a net benefit next year even if spot prices stay high? It just seems like there's almost a $500 million tailwind going into next year just from hedge realizations rolling off. I was hoping you can give some more clarity there.
Jen Kneale: We have hedged at higher prices in 2023 relative to 2022. So that will provide a nice tailwind for us. If you look across all commodities, I'd say that our hedge prices right now are, call it, 25% plus higher than where they are for 2022. So I think you're right in saying that, that will be a nice tailwind for us as well as just continued volume growth as well. So if we have continued higher prices like we're seeing more prompt given the backwardation in the market, then as we realize those higher prices on additional volumes, that will be a nice tailwind as well.
Michael Cusimano: Got it. That's very helpful. And then I'll kind of take the bait and asking about just Medford impact which I've seen on your system. And part of the strength in the frac volumes are a direct result of that.
Matt Meloy: Yes. So I really kind of answer the overall frac market question previously. The frac market is tied. It's a combination of increased volumes from Y-grade. And you have some operational upsets from the industry that is moving more volumes to Belvieu. So yes, that is tightening up the Belvieu to some extent.
Operator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sanjay Lad for any closing remarks.
Sanjay Lad: Great. Thanks to everyone that was on the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Have a great day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-05 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Targa Resources Corp. First Quarter 2022 Earnings Webcast and Presentation. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Sanjay Lad, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks, RJ. Good morning, and welcome to the first quarter 2022 earnings call for Targa Resources Corp. The first quarter earnings release, along with the first quarter earnings supplement presentation for Targa Resources that accompany our call, are available on our website at targaresources.com in the Investors Section. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website.  Statements made during this call that might include Targa Resources' expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings.  Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer; and Jen Kneale, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, the following senior management team members will be available for Q&A. Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer.  And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.
Matthew Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning. We are continuing to perform well and are off to a good start to the year on a number of fronts. Record high quarterly EBITDA of $626 million, record volumes in the Permian and record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes.  We also achieved investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies during the quarter. We completed our corporate simplification, with the DevCo repurchase in January and with the redemption of our preferred stock earlier this week.  We continue to invest across our businesses with ongoing construction of the Legacy I, Legacy II and Midway plants in the Permian, plus the acquisition of bolt-on assets in South Texas.  We repurchased additional common shares as part of our increasing return of capital to investors. And our reported leverage ratio at 3.4x is in the bottom half of our long-term target range of 3x to 4x.  Pro forma for the repurchase of our DevCo interest, our preferred stock redemption, our South Texas acquisition and our GCX sale, our leverage is 3.3x.  While we had a strong first quarter with EBITDA up $55 million versus Q4, commodity prices really began to move higher late in the quarter. So we did not see a lot of first quarter price benefit, as our realized prices were relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter. But since then, prices are providing some nice tailwinds for the balance of the year. Given the strong underlying fundamentals of Targa's businesses, we continue to expect that if prices average around current levels for 2022, we would exceed the top end of our previously disclosed full year financial guidance range.  Let's now turn the call -- or let's now discuss operational in more detail. Starting in the Permian, our systems across the Midland and Delaware Basins continued to perform well, averaging over 3 billion cubic feet per day inlet volume during the first quarter. Volumes across our Permian systems increased quarter-over-quarter despite being impacted by winter weather conditions, particularly in January and February. Volumes quickly rebounded, with March and April volumes up nicely over the first quarter average. We continued to see strong activity levels across both our Midland and Delaware footprint, and expect to benefit from this positive momentum as we move through 2022.  In Permian Midland, our systems continued to run near full and our engineering and operations teams are working diligently to bring our next 275 million cubic feet per day Legacy plant online safely later this year. Our Legacy II plant, another new 275 million cubic feet per day plant in Permian Midland, is expected to begin operations during the second quarter of 2023.  In Permian Delaware, volumes across our system are also continuing to ramp. Our new 275 million cubic feet per day Midway plant is expected to begin operations during the third quarter of 2023. Midway will provide us with additional flexibility to flow volumes between our Midland and Delaware systems in addition to improving our overall operational performance in the region.  For full year 2022, we continue to expect our average Permian inlet volumes to increase by 12% to 15% over 2021 volumes.  In our Central and Badlands regions, first quarter volumes were impacted by winter weather conditions, most notably in the Badlands. We are seeing stronger activity levels across several regions given the higher commodity price environment.  In April, we completed the acquisition of assets in South Texas and are quickly integrating the assets and related contracts acquired in our South Texas gathering and processing operations and expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive. We would like to thank everyone involved in helping make the integration go smoothly.  Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. NGL transportation volumes continued to increase, and we transported a record 460,000 barrels per day to Mont Belvieu during the first quarter. Throughput volumes sequentially increased 6%, driven by increasing NGL production from Targa's Permian plants and third parties. Fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex during the first quarter rebounded at 703,000 per day following fourth quarter's unplanned outage. Looking ahead, we expect NGL transportation and fractionation volumes to continue to benefit from increasing supply from our growing Permian G&P position.  In our LPG export services business at Galena Park, we loaded an average of 10.2 million barrels per month during the first quarter. The outlook for our LPG export business remains strong. We are advancing our previously announced low-cost expansion project to increase our propane loading capabilities, which will add an incremental 1 million barrels per month of capacity by mid-2023.  The longer-term outlook for Targa remains strong. Our premier integrated Permian NGL business, complemented by our talented employees and strong balance sheet, position Targa to deliver safe, reliable energy domestically and globally.  And before I turn the call over to Jen, I would like to thank our employees for their continued focus on safety, while executing on our strategic priorities and continuing to provide best-in-class services to our customers.  With that, I will turn the call over to Jen.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $626 million, increasing 10% sequentially as we benefited from the repurchase of our DevCo joint ventures and higher volumes across most of our assets, offset by the sale of our equity interest in Gulf Coast Express pipeline and lower marketing margin.  Targa generated adjusted free cash flow of $373 million in the first quarter. We are significantly hedged for 2022 and continue to add hedges for 2023 and beyond, while still benefiting from higher prices across our unhedged equity volume exposure and prices above fee floors.  Looking ahead, as a reminder, the integration of the recently acquired bolt-on midstream assets and associated contracts to our South Texas G&P operations will be reflected in consolidated G&P segment earnings for the second quarter.  Our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.4x at the end of the first quarter, and we had about $2 billion of available liquidity. In April, we successfully completed our inaugural TRGP notes offering in the investment-grade market, issuing $750 million of 4.2% senior notes due 2033 and $750 million of 4.95% senior notes due 2052. We really appreciate the support of our new and existing fixed income investors in our initial IG offering and are pleased to have been able to access the 30-year market for the first time.  Earlier this week, we completed the redemption of all of our outstanding Series A preferred stock for approximately $973 million. The redemption of the preferred completes an important strategic goal to simplify our capital structure, and we were able to do so sooner than previous expectations as a result of our strong company performance.  With respect to the sale of our interest in GCX, the call right process has concluded, and we expect to receive final payment on or around May 20.  As Matt mentioned, our pro forma leverage ratio is 3.3x and trending lower, which puts us in excellent financial position with a lot of flexibility.  We continue to expect to spend $700 million to $800 million on attractive organic growth capital opportunities in 2022, with approximately $121 million spent through the first quarter to support continued volume growth across our systems.  We are paying an attractive $1.40 annualized dividend per common share for 2022, and have been able to return additional capital to our common shareholders through opportunistic repurchases, with $50 million of shares repurchased in the first quarter.  Our continued investment in growing Targa's underlying businesses, supported by an attractive macro backdrop and the strength of our balance sheet means we are in excellent position looking forward to continue to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders.  Lastly, I'd like to echo Matt and thank our employees for their dedication and for continuing to prioritize safety. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks, Jen. [Operator Instructions]. RJ, would you please open the line for Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays.
Theresa Chen: First, I would just like to ask about your capital allocation priorities from here, given that you've streamlined your structure and fundamentals seem to be trending well. Can you talk about common share repurchases, increasing the dividend and so on?
Jennifer Kneale: Theresa, this is Jen. I think from our perspective, you'll see us kind of execute going forward, sort of as we are today, increase the common share dividend 2022 versus 2021, and that's the dividend that we'll have for this year, and then we'll revisit next February. You're seeing us continue to invest in our business. And also, you're seeing us to execute on opportunistic share repurchases.  So I think that's going to be the formula for us going forward. And then, it's just going to be a matter of the opportunities in front of us to figure out where we think our capital is best spent.
Theresa Chen: Got it. And there's been so much momentum in your story in the macro tailwinds. I think all of that is pretty clear. In your mind, what do you think the key risks are from here?
Matthew Meloy: Theresa, I think we feel really good about our business. We've made a lot of improvements to the balance sheet over the years, we've simplified our structure. So the risks that are out there inherent in our business are commodity prices and volumes. But even from both of those, I feel like we're better insulated and better protected to the downside today than we were a year or 2 ago. So I think it's the same risks that we look at.  We've made a lot of progress on recontracting and putting in fee floors in our G&P business. We also have a significant amount of hedges, which reduces our commodity price exposure. And just as we continue to grow across our footprints, we have really strong diverse customers across our G&P in multiple basins and have good diverse customer set out in the Permian.  So the risk kind of remain in our business, but I think we've done a good job at trying to protect ourselves from the downside.
Jennifer Kneale: I think the starting point, if any risks do present themselves, is just so different for us today than it ever has been before. We've just never been stronger, Theresa. So I think we'll be able to withstand and perform exceptionally well even if those risks do present themselves going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Just wanted to start off with the guidance here, if I could, the EBITDA guidance, I recognize it's early in the year. But just doing some simple math here. It seems like if you annualize first quarter, you'd be at the top end of the guide. In first quarter, didn't seem to benefit from commodity prices, I think, as you said there. And then also, January had a freeze-off weather impact weighing on the quarter. And it doesn't seem like the guide includes the Southcross benefit. And if I overlay spot commodity prices, it's something like a $250 million add to it.  So just reconcile these different things. I know the commodity price isn't baked into the guide where it is right now, but Southcross annualizing first quarter all points to above the high end. Is there any offsets over the balance of the year that we should be thinking about?
Jennifer Kneale: The only offset that I'd just start with, and then I'll turn it over to Matt, is just the sale of GCX was not part of our guidance. Oh, it was. I'm sorry, it was contemplated in our guidance. So yes, I think that you've got the pieces directionally correct. Current spot prices, just given the backwardation that still exists as we look out for the balance of 2022 is part of the unknown for us right now, but we are very well hedged and are continuing to add hedges. So I think we are in just an excellent position.  Matt, anything else?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. Yes, Jeremy, I think you laid it out pretty well. I feel like Q1 was a really good quarter for us. We had increasing volumes in the Permian. But if you look in the Permian Midland, it was up a little bit, almost flat Q1 to Q4. We had some winter weather and operational issues in January and February, but we've seen volumes rebound nicely in March and April. So it sets us up for good volume growth from now through year-end.  And if you look at prices, NGLs were up a little bit, but gas was actually quarter-to-quarter for us, realized, down. And as you know, Waha prices now are much, much higher than our average in Q1. So between gas and NGL, if prices hang around here, we're going to have a lot of uplift as we go throughout the year.  We also had lower volumes due to some weather impacts up in the Badlands and across our central regions, too. So with a little bit warmer weather, higher prices, I think it sets up really nicely for the balance of the year.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. So I didn't hear anything to walk me away from kind of $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion or more if commodity prices...
Matthew Meloy: We have not been that specific. We just said, I think we're in good shape as we kind of move throughout the rest of this year if prices hang around here -- even if prices don't hang around here, I think we're in really good shape.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Yes, it looks like that way to us as well. And maybe just pivoting more towards Permian logistics here. The numbers we run on the basin seems like processing capacity is pretty tight. Egress for natural gas, pretty tight as well. There's a number of solutions, I guess, out there on the egress side. Just wondering, your appetite to participate in nat gas takeaway kind of to match, I guess, yours -- your equity and your customers' nat gas production needs. And then, on the G&P side, you have several plants in the hopper, but just wondering, I guess, overall growth expectations moving forward in the Permian on those 2 fronts?
Matthew Meloy: Sure. We've seen pretty good growth here in the Permian, just in the aggregate and on our system over the last 12 months, and we think there's going to be continued growth as we look forward. I'm going to turn it over to Bobby, who can talk a little bit just about how we're thinking about residue takeaway opportunities.
Robert Muraro: This is Bobby. So on the residue side, we were excited to see the most recent announcements on the expansions. At the end of the day, we look like a producer relative to our exposure. So what we want to know is that the gas flows and then ultimately, we will obviously want basis as flat possible. So we've known about it for a long time, we've known about the expectations of where our expectations of where supply was going. So we're fully prepped for it on the target side even before any of the new pipes come online. But yes, we expect and hope for more pipes to get announced. And whether we participate in it or not really, you'll see us end them at times when they need us to go. And if they don't need us to go, we won't be in them, right? So I think as we think through those things, we just want to see the pipes get built, and the takeaway, egress get there in time for us to not see big basis blowouts.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. I'll leave it there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Colton Bean: So you all mentioned the weather impacts on the Badlands in Q1. And I think we've seen kind of a continuation of that severe weather here quarter-to-date. So can you just update us what you've seen as we move through April? And then are there any longer-term infrastructure damage and considerations that you have as you think about the balance of the year?
Matthew Meloy: Yes, sure. I'm going to turn it over to Pat to answer that one.
Patrick McDonie: Yes, you're right. I mean, obviously, there's been a couple of pretty significant weather events in April in the Badlands. And about the time you get back up from the first one, you know the second one follows up behind. And they were pretty severe. They took production across the Badlands almost to nothing across everybody's systems.  Certainly, we're in the rebound mode, we're coming back up, we are not fully up. So will it impact our second quarter? Sure. April, it was impacted. We're still not fully up in May, but we're getting closer, hopefully, mid, late May, we'll appreciably be fully back up to where we were before the weather impact. But on our side, at least, we do have some things that are positive throughout the remainder of the year that will help offset some of the occurrences relative to the weather here in April.
Colton Bean: Got it. And maybe just to clarify that. On the offsets, is that thinking for DMP in aggregate or Badlands specific?
Patrick McDonie: Badlands-specific.
Colton Bean: Okay. Great. And then, Jen, last quarter, I think you mentioned that M&A was a consideration for the first time in a while. Can you just update us on what you all are seeing in the market and if that may still be a use of cash going forward?
Jennifer Kneale: I think for us, you saw us execute on the Southcross acquisition, a great acquisition for us. We're excited to have those employees join the Targa team. Integration is going well, and that's an example of a transaction where we think we're able to buy at really attractive prices and then benefit from synergies, both near term and over the medium and longer term.  There are more assets and companies available in the market today than there certainly have been over the last couple of years, which is understandable given the strength of commodity prices. And so for us, the bar continues to be very, very high. And that means that there are a number of unique characteristics that any transaction would have to meet in order for us to even consider looking at it. So I think you'll see us continue to be very selective about anything that we spend our time on.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Reynolds with UBS.
Brian Reynolds: Maybe, to start off a little bit on future growth projects. No CapEx change with the earnings release, but kind of looking ahead towards 2023, we started hearing from many of your peers of adding additional frac capacity. I'm just kind of curious around Targa's thought process around pursuing a new build versus securing 100% of the economics versus potentially unidling the JV frac that's in Mont Belvieu currently?
Scott Pryor: Brian, this is Scott Pryor. Just to touch base, we do feel like the fractionation market is starting to tighten up. The number of inquiries that have come into us, both for short-term as well as long-term frac needs has increased. And some of those are actually folks that I think are trying to get a little bit ahead of the tightening of the market by trying to secure a fractionation that may start more dated into the future.  We've got a permit in hand for Train 9. We continuously are evaluating when we need to formally start that -- the construction of that. And we will stay well ahead of that relative to what our needs are. Recognize that we've got good transparency back to our producers behind our gas processing plant. And as a result of that, the timing of that, we will be well ahead of that.  So Again, I feel like the market is starting to tighten up, the number of inquiries coming in and the view that we have back to our producers, we feel like it -- there will be a time here in the near future that we'll look at starting Train 9 and the construction of that.
Brian Reynolds: Great. Appreciate that color. And then maybe, just as a quick follow-up on guidance and specifically, the Permian inlet volumes. So far this year, we've seen a major customer in the Delaware increase their production guidance expectations for the year. And the Midland seems to be a little bit flattish for the last 2 quarters. And ultimately, wondering if this is related to, one, is there any change to any change in cadence to that Permian outlook? Or maybe, said differently, does the guidance effectively imply just a really strong back half of the year as it relates to just volumes flowing through your system downstream?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. I think we continue to see really strong activity across our overall Permian footprint. Part of what you've seen in the Permian Midland, as we've seen in previous years, we tend to get more of our growth in that system over the summer when it warms up, spring/summer time frame. So it has some seasonality in it. And again, we had January and February, which was kind of impacted more by cold weather and some operational issues, and we are seeing some of that increase already in March and April.  So we continue to expect growth across both Permian Midland and Delaware. But we also have seen some of our larger producers stick with their -- kind of stick with their previous guidance and what they're telling us in terms of volume growth. So just because you're getting higher prices doesn't necessarily mean they're going to ramp up production.  But it is a mixed bag there. We have seen some of our larger customers point to increasing the growth rate. So I think that may have some impact on 2022, but perhaps that's more 2023 and as we go forward. We are still seeing good activity across our smaller private E&P customers who are continuing to drill. So no, I think we are pretty optimistic about our Permian growth from here going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.
Keith Stanley: First question, just with Gulf Coast Express, the sale proceeds coming in. Should we assume you use that to repay any short-term borrowings you might have done to take out the prefs? Or should we think of GCX cash as available for allocation with free cash flow over the rest of the year?
Jennifer Kneale: The expectation would be that when we receive those proceeds, we'll use it to reduce borrowings under our revolver right now, Keith.
Keith Stanley: Okay. Got it. And second question, can you just give an update on where you're at for 2023 hedging, particularly for Permian gas basis, just percent of equity volumes or however you want to frame it?
Matthew Meloy: Yes, sure. So we're significantly hedged on the gas side. And when we do hedge, most of our volumes are Permian related, so we do hedge Waha basis. So we try and cover as best we can kind of the basis risk associated with our hedges. And where we have gas in Oklahoma, we'll hedge at those physical points as well.  We were significantly hedged kind of earlier in the year, and we've added as we've seen strength in gas prices and NGLs. We've continued to layer on additional hedges not only for this year but for the next several years. So I'd say with prices hanging around here, we'll continue with our programmatic approach to continue to add more hedges.
Jennifer Kneale: And Keith, our 10-Q will be published later today so you'll be able to see in there the volumes that are now hedged across both gas, NGLs and condensate.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse.
Spiro Dounis: Just wanted to talk about the quarter-over-quarter variance on Slide 7. Two things that stuck out to me there. Just on OpEx, it looks like -- I guess I was a little surprised to see costs actually come down for G&P, for labor and chemicals, just given the inflationary environment that we're in. So just curious, is that sustainable? Is that part of a broader cost control initiative?  And the other item there was just on the G&P margin. Matt, I know you mentioned the commodity really to pick up until the end of the quarter, was just was surprised that, that was a negative contributing factor. So curious if there was a mix shift in the quarter, any hedging impact there to be aware of?
Jennifer Kneale: Spiro, this is Jen. I'll take the first part of the question. So some of what we did in our G&P business was in the fourth quarter. We actually went ahead and bought fairly significant amount of chemicals ahead of time. So our chemical costs for the first quarter went down as a result of that. I'd expect our Q2 through, really, Q4 OpEx to step up as we move through time here, as we are seeing higher costs as a result of inflation and just difficulty getting certain things.  So Q1, I think a little bit of an anomaly. And then also, on the compensation side, we had a higher bonus that we ended up paying for the fourth quarter. And so that was reflected in the fourth quarter, and then we tend to accrue at a lower number as we begin a new year, and so that's what we're doing in the first quarter. So that's part of what you're seeing as well that I think is, again, creating a little bit of an anomaly in Q1 relative to Q4.
Matthew Meloy: Yes. And then, on the mix shift. When you look at first quarter versus fourth quarter, really, the big increase in commodity price was relative to crude oil prices. We don't have that much exposure directly to crude oil prices. We have some, but not that much. It's really on the gas side and the NGL side and gas was down and NGLs were up almost offsetting. So a lot of the run that we saw was in March, so we had some benefit kind of late in the quarter, but it's really kind of through April and then into kind of where we are now.  So not a mix shift. It's just kind of the way all 3 of those different commodity prices move relative to Q4.
Spiro Dounis: Got it. Okay. That's really helpful. Second one, just going back to some comments from last quarter around energy transition. I think you all had mentioned evaluating a few renewable or carbon capture opportunities. Just curious if there's been any update on that front?
Matthew Meloy: I'd say we are continuing to work on a potential carbon capture solution. So I'd say that is ongoing. It's going to take a while for us to develop that. I think we're in a good position to develop that. And so we are working with others trying to put something together there to see if we can capture CO2 out in the Permian and move it down hole, there are discussions at other parts in and around our business as well. I think it's just going to continue to make progress, but I think it's going to be a while before we can move anything over the finish line, too.
Spiro Dounis: Got it. Great. We'll stay tuned.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.
Michael Blum: I wanted to ask about LPG export markets. I know you're more heavily weighted to South America, but wondering if you're seeing any drop in demand in China given the COVID-related lockdowns there. And then I guess, just more broadly, any impact to volumes from some of the global supply constraints and some of the shipping bottlenecks we've been reading about?
Scott Pryor: Michael, this is Scott. First off, I would say that when we initially started our export business, we were -- yes, we were heavily weighted towards South America. Since then, much like the rest of the players in the marketplace, we have diversified more heavily, if you will, to the Far East and that growing demand that is there. Places like China for PDH plants, for chemical plants and even for domestic... I would say, when you look at our performance on a quarter-by-quarter basis, we continue to be very consistent. At times, there are some weather issues that may impact it. There might be some logistical challenges as it relates to the shipping market from time to time. And we have seen some of that and did see some of that in the first quarter of this year.  But all in all, the market is still very solid. Over time, it will continue to grow. We feel very good about the expansion that we're doing. It's very -- it's small, but yet very complementary to our business, which will allow us for some incremental capacity, and provides additional reliability to our customers that are historical lifters.  So again, we've got a good portfolio of customers. They're strong, they stick with us, they appreciate the reliability that we provide, and I think as we continue to see LPG's production increase here in the U.S., we will look for incremental ways to continue to debottleneck where it makes sense and push those across the water.
Michael Blum: Great. I appreciate it. Other question I wanted to ask was just about ethane rejection and what you're seeing across your system right now, and then, how you see that trending for the balance of the year? And is there any upside to volumes related to that?
Matthew Meloy: Yes, Michael, we are in recovery across our systems, and we have been for some time. So I don't really see a big change for us there. Our exposure to ethane is really more on the price side than the volume side. So as ethane moves up, we have some hedge, but we do have some length on that. So we benefit from higher prices on ethane, but I wouldn't expect to see with ethane prices moving up, much of a volume impact, really.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities.
Sunil Sibal: Thanks for all the clarity on the call. I just had one follow-up from previous discussion on OpEx. So it seems like OpEx, over the last couple of quarters, has kind of swung around a bit. I was wondering, is there a good way to think about your OpEx in fixed versus variable buckets, especially when you think about exposure to commodity chemicals and all that?
Jennifer Kneale: I don't think that there's an easy framework that I can give you, Sunil, related to that. I think that as we think about OpEx Q2 going forward, it's likely to begin to look more like the fourth quarter than the first quarter. So that's probably the best visibility that I can give you right now. But we're also seeing prices increase real time. So it's a little bit tough to predict as well.  I think our operations teams and engineering teams are doing an excellent job of trying to stay in front of inflation and rising costs as much as they possibly can and are doing an excellent job working with our suppliers, but it's just a little bit difficult to predict right now. But I think the best visibility I can give you is that second quarter and go forward will look more like the fourth quarter than the first quarter.
Sunil Sibal: Okay. Got it. And then on the NGL marketing side, I think you mentioned in the press release also that there was less optimization opportunities. Obviously, some of that is seasonal, too. But I was curious, is there a good way to think about that part of your business? And what are the drivers of this optimization revenues for you?
Matthew Meloy: Yes, sure. I'd say it's really probably more in the comparison. If you look at last quarter, we had some contango trades that were still unwinding when we had contango that we put on some dated trade. So there's really just less of that in the first quarter relative to previous periods. So I think that is the primary driver of that.
Sunil Sibal: So then going forward, I guess, Q2, Q3 are normally seasonally weak -- seasonally weaker than you would expect that to kind of pick up, obviously, overlaying some contango opportunities which may show up?
Matthew Meloy: Well, the seasonality part of it, we do have some -- we get some benefit in both Q4 and Q1 from our seasonal wholesale propane business. And so that will come off in Q2 and Q3. Yes, as far as the contango or backwardation or those kind of opportunities that present our marketing team, that really just depends on market conditions. So I'd say, in Q1, there was just relatively less of those compared to prior periods, and it will -- we'll see what Q2 and the go-forward quarters present us.
Scott Pryor: And Matt, just to add -- this is Scott real quick. On the wholesale side of our business, we did see a strong fourth quarter in certain areas of our business, especially those areas where we have nice pockets of field inventory. So more of those volumes moved out during the fourth quarter than they did in the first quarter. So as a result of that, we had some uplift, probably earlier in the winter season than we did in the latter part of the winter season, just where our position is on inventories.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harry Mateer with Barclays.
Harry Mateer: First question, it seems like you guys made it up to investment grade just some time for the rates market to get turnarounds ahead a bit, but I'm curious whether you see more opportunities to optimize the capital structure and your interest expense in the second half now you've done your inaugural IG deal?
Jennifer Kneale: Harry, this is Jen. I think we'll have continued opportunities just moving forward. We do have some higher coupon notes. So depending on the callability and call prices of those notes, we'll be continuing to try to figure out how to best manage our liquidity and our notes positions going forward. I do think there is continued opportunities to benefit from savings, but the cadence of that is largely going to be dependent on the prices that we can call in those notes and then where can we issue notes in the market going forward. So we'll just have to see how that plays out. But I think we're in an excellent position anyway.
Harry Mateer: Okay. And then, earlier on the call, you answered that the call on the GCX proceeds is going to be towards paying down the revolver. Just would love to get a sense for how you structurally like to plan out liquidity, whether it's a cash balance you'd like to have? Or what are some guardrails we can think about it on a quarter-to-quarter basis that you'd like to keep in terms of available liquidity?
Jennifer Kneale: I think a lot of the cash that you see on our balance sheet quarter-to-quarter really has more to do with the JVs and the terms of the JVs and when cash is distributed out of those joint ventures than anything else.  So we're generally trying to manage our liquidity position as optimally as we can. And so that means utilizing the available tools that we have, whether that be our revolver or accounts receivable facility or just maintaining cash on the balance sheet.  So there isn't a hard and fast rule that we're following that I can give you. It's really just us trying to manage as best as possible to minimize interest expense and maximize the liquidity that we have at all times.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Mackay with Goldman Sachs.
John Mackay: I wanted to go back to some of the questions -- some of the comments on capital returns. Have you seen some of your peers that saw distribution or dividend cuts in the past kind of aiming to get back to where they used to be and they've kind of started that process now. Just curious if that's on the table for you guys or maybe just a little more detail on how you're thinking about that and whether or not it could be a payout that's more in line with the S&P 500 type framework?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. Sure, John. Yes, good question. I think as we really review our dividend payout, as Jen mentioned, we'll plan to provide an update for you early part of next year. It's not our goal to get back to where we used to be. I think we're looking at market indicators. We are looking at S&P 400, S&P 500 in terms of -- we'll look at yield. I know that moves around with the share price. So we'll look at percent return based on free cash flow and other cash flow metrics as well.  So I think we're going to be in a really good position to continue to move our dividend higher given all the free cash flow that we have. So we'll just evaluate it. I'd say similar to the way we evaluated it last year. We'll look and say where do we want to be? Well, we will look at our peers and see what they are paying out, but we'll also look at, I'd say, a broader peer group of the S&P 400, S&P 500. And I think both of those will inform our decision as we think about what we want to do for '23, but then also, as we think about kind of a multiyear, how do we want to be kind of layering in to increase payout over time.
John Mackay: That's great. Appreciate that, Matt. Definitely in the buyback camp over here, for what it's worth. Maybe just one more from my side. Some of the weather issues kind of masked some of the basin trends. So just wondering if you could give us an update on kind of what you're seeing in terms of green shoots or not in some of your other basins kind of outside of the Permian?
Matthew Meloy: Sure. Pat, do you want to give a bit of an update there?
Patrick McDonie: Sure. We have seen increased activity level across all our basins. We've seen not a huge uptick, but a pretty steady, nice uptick in our Oklahoma regions, more so on the southeast side of the state versus Western Oklahoma. Certainly, we've seen people that haven't drilled in 2, 3 years employing rigs and drilling wells. We've seen a lot of recompletions. So I'd say, we're stemming the tide there relative to past steady declines over the last 3, 4 years. We're seeing enough activity to offset decline and, frankly, in some areas to actually grow.  In the Barnett, we're seeing activity that we haven't seen in the past. And frankly, that's a little more lumpy. So you'll see that showing up in our volumes as we go throughout the year, but we have some positive tailwinds there.  South Texas is such a competitive environment, it kind of gets lost in the sauce. But certainly, with our new acquisition, there's different opportunities relative to sour gas capture, et cetera. So we see opportunity in our South Texas region.  And the Badlands is steady, is the best way to put it. The activity level is steady. Certainly, we've had weather events, but we haven't seen a huge uptick, but we've seen good, steady activity levels.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra with Bank of America.
Indraneel Mitra: I wanted to follow up on the ethane recovery, specifically how it relates to Grand Prix. In 2023, the basin should probably move to full ethane recovery. And I'm wondering how your third-party shippers will fare on this, whether your incentive rates will go up or your volumes, how do you see the outlook for Grand Prix with ethane recovery for the basin just trending up?
Scott Pryor: Neel, this is Scott. As Matt said earlier, when we look at our pipeline as we're getting into our fractionation facility in Mont Belvieu, both of the plants that are operating on our systems -- we do have a few third-party plants that will evaluate ethane recovery based upon their situation where, they're located and whatever their contracts are around their system. But all in all, for the most part, we don't see a lot of swing on both our pipeline as well as the third-party pipelines that are coming into our system.  So I would say that it's not a big needle mover. Matt kind of indicated that earlier. But I think that when you look at where the pricing is today, most plants should be in recovery, and that's what we're seeing on our system. And given the price advantage that we see on the petrochemical side, I think that, that will continue for a while. But there's going to be some noise from time to time that all in all, for the most part in our system, we assume that we're going to have some recovery [indiscernible] fractionation footprint.
Indraneel Mitra: Okay. And then second question, I know you market a lot of your producer volumes, residue gas volumes at the tailgate and you've been planning for a while for the gas egress issue. But can you kind of just walk me through how you plan for that when you have such massive growth on your systems, 10-plus percent every year. How far in advance you do that? And whether you see any potential issues running into 2023, even though you've started to plan for it early?
Robert Muraro: This is Bobby. What I'd tell you is it's important to both have your own transport out of the basin, but then, a vast majority of what we do is we team up with, I'll call it, partners in the basin that have their own transport out of the basin. So as you think about us being Waha-exposed and we look to go sell gas at Waha, we will sell it to people that we know -- for lots of different reasons -- have that physical transport to get it out of the basin. They're very large counterparties that everyone on this call would know. And that's how we focus it.  Then when you think about how long to go forward, we obviously we look at when we think pipes will be coming online, when we expect our -- there to be capacity issues out of the basin, and we make sure we're crossing across that. And we don't try to get cute within months. We make sure we're well beyond when those expansions and pipes will come online.  So we've been doing that, we're still doing that, we've got everything that we think we need covered. And we even take out some insurance beyond that over time. So yes, so it's one where we're able to plan as far out as we want because people want to buy the gas for as long as we're willing to sell it. And then, we try to do it and match it up with when we think the -- there could be issues.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Mosca with Mizuho Securities.
Robert Mosca: Just one question for me. Grand Prix volumes have grown pretty strongly over the last few quarters. Just hoping to get your latest thoughts on how that pipeline could be expanded in the medium term? And how early you think an expansion on the Permian segment would be required, just assuming that the potential residue constraint gets addressed?
Scott Pryor: Robert, this is Scott. Yes, we have been very pleased with the continuation of increased volumes on our transportation side of our business, quarter in and quarter out. First quarter averaging 460,000 barrels a day into out Mont Belvieu complex. So -- and again, we had good transparency back to our customers and our producers behind our plant and the additive of gas processing plants in the Permian.  So we will continue to add pumps along the pipeline sector. We've got good operating leverage today. And remember, when we throw out those stats around 460,000 barrels, again, to the first quarter, that -- part of that contribution is coming from North Texas and into Oklahoma from our applications in that area.  So we will evaluate the need for additional pipe and pipe expansions. We will be well ahead of that relative to what our needs are and the producers behind our system. So it's something that we're going to be well ahead of when it's necessary.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Sanjay.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks to everyone that was on the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The Investor Relations team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thanks, and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: 00:04 Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Targa Resources Corp. Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] 00:33 I will now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Sanjay Lad, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Mr. Lad, the floor is yours.
Sanjay Lad: 00:44 Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the fourth quarter 2021 earnings call for Targa Resources Corp. The fourth quarter earnings release, along with the fourth quarter earnings supplement presentation for Targa Resources that accompany our call are available on our website at targaresources.com in the Investors section. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. 01:09 Statements made during this call that might include Targa Resources' expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings. 01:34 Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer; and Jen Kneale, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, the following senior management team members will be available for Q&A: Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. 01:57 And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.
Matt Meloy: 02:00 Thanks, Sanjay and good morning. This is an exciting time at Targa, where our operational and financial execution in 2021 provided a lot of momentum for 2022. I would first like to recognize and thank Targa's employees that worked tirelessly across another year of challenges in 2021 to help drive record financial and operational performance. 02:22 Let's quickly mention some of the highlights from 2021: record Gathering and Processing volumes in the Permian, safely bringing the Heim Plant online, on time and under budget, record volumes across our Logistics and Transportation assets, record adjusted EBITDA of $2.05 billion, a 25% increase over 2020, about $1.2 billion of year-over-year debt reduction and a year-end leverage ratio of 3.2 times, and increasing return of capital to our shareholders through a higher fourth quarter dividend and fourth quarter common share repurchases. 03:01 Turning to 2022, we already have a number of highlights to mention, repurchased our DevCo joint venture interest in January, executed agreements to sell our 25% equity interest in Gulf Coast Express Pipeline, or GCX, for approximately 11 times EBITDA, upgraded to investment grade by Fitch and moved to positive Watch by S&P and Moody's, and refinanced our revolving credit facility to a five-year $2.75 billion facility at TRC. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities and have visibility to volume growth across our assets, which is driving increasing EBITDA as we look forward. 03:42 For 2022, we estimate full year adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, which is a significant increase over 2021. This guidance is based on forward prices where there continues to be backwardation. If prices averaged around today's levels for 2022, we would expect to exceed the top end of our full year financial guidance. With the repurchase of our DevCo interest and our flexibility to accelerate redemption of our preferred stock, given the sale of GCX, we have already simplified and will continue to simplify our capital structure. 04:19 We are also demonstrating our increasing ability to return capital to our shareholders with the execution of common share repurchases in the fourth quarter, in addition to the fourth quarter common share dividend increase. As previously discussed, we expect to pay a common dividend of $0.35 per quarter, $1.40 annualized to our shareholders for 2022. The strength of our balance sheet provides significant flexibility to redeem our preferred shares faster than we previously anticipated and to continue to assess opportunistic repurchases of common shares. 04:53 Let's now turn to our operations. Starting in the Permian, our systems across the Midland and Delaware Basins continue to perform well, averaging a record 3 billion cubic feet per day reported inlet during the fourth quarter. Our average 2021 Permian inlet volumes increased 12% over 2020, exceeding the top end of our 2021 growth range. We continue to see strong activity levels across both our Midland and Delaware footprints and expect to benefit from this positive momentum as we move through 2022. 05:27 For full year 2022, we expect our average Permian inlet to increase between 12% to 15% over average 2021. In Permian Midland, our system continues to run near full with our next 275 million cubic feet per day Legacy Plant on track to begin operations during the fourth quarter of this year. With robust activity levels expected to continue into next year and beyond, we are moving forward with the construction of our Legacy II plant, another new 275 million cubic feet per day plant in the Permian Midland. Legacy II is expected to begin operations during the second quarter of 2023. 06:07 In Permian Delaware, volumes across our system also continue to ramp. Today, we announced the construction of a new 275 million cubic feet per day plant -- the Midway plant. The new Midway plant is expected to begin operations during the third quarter of 2023. Midway will provide us with additional flexibility to flow volumes between our Midland and Delaware systems. We are idling an older plant, which is more prone to operational upsets, has higher operating costs, higher maintenance costs, lower recoveries and is limited in capacity. 06:40 The Midway plant improves performance on all of those items and will give us the ability to flow current volumes being processed at Sand Hills and an additional 110 million cubic feet per day of capacity that can be filled from the Delaware, Central or Midland Basins. This project is a good example of how to improve our overall environmental performance while also providing attractive returns. 07:07 The strong outlook across our Permian Basin footprint will continue to drive incremental volumes through our NGL downstream businesses and our recently announced expansions in both the Midland and Delaware, position Targa to realize very attractive integrated returns and continue to benefit from our embedded operating leverage with modest capital spending. 07:27 In our Central and Badlands regions, we are seeing stronger activity levels given the higher commodity price environment and expect 2022 average Central and Badlands volumes in aggregate to be flat relative to 2021 as higher production is expected to largely offset legacy decline in our systems. 07:46 Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. NGL transportation volumes continue to increase and we transported a record 433,000 barrels per day to Mont Belvieu during the fourth quarter. Throughput volumes sequentially increased 4%, driven by increasing NGL production from Targa's Permian plants, including our new Heim Plant and third-parties. 08:10 Fourth quarter fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex averaged 612,000 barrels per day and were lower sequentially due to an unplanned outage in associated repairs and maintenance, which impacted volumes by about 50,000 barrels per day. The unplanned outage was associated with cooling water exchangers that support a portion of our CBF fracs, which resulted in reduced operating rates for the quarter. 08:35 We have excess fractionation capacity, so we are handling all incoming NGL volumes as well as some volumes that normally would have been fractionated in Q4, so our Q1 average volumes are expected to be higher. We expect to be operating back to normal by the end of the quarter. This outage resulted in higher CapEx -- sorry, in higher OpEx in Q4 and is also expected to impact OpEx in Q1 of this year. 09:01 Looking ahead to 2022, we expect higher year-over-year Grand Prix and fractionation volumes as our downstream systems continue to benefit from increasing supply from our growing Permian G&P position. In our LPG export services business at Galena Park, fourth quarter volumes rebounded following maintenance completed during the third quarter and increased 19% sequentially as we loaded an average 10.7 million barrels per month during the fourth quarter. 09:31 The outlook for our LPG export business in 2022 remains robust, complemented by our contracted portfolio and supply position in Mont Belvieu. In response to growing international demand for cleaner feedstocks and U.S. LPGs, we are undertaking an additional low cost expansion project to increase our loading rates at our Galena Park facilities. This refrigeration expansion will increase our propane loading capabilities more than an incremental 1 million barrels per month by mid-2023. 10:05 The longer-term outlook for Targa is strong. Our premier integrated Permian NGL business, our talented employees, complemented by our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, we remain in position to grow our footprint and return increasing capital to our shareholders over time. 10:24 With that, I will now turn the call over to Jen.
Jen Kneale: 10:27 Thanks, Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $571 million, increasing 13% sequentially as we benefited from higher volumes across most of our assets and higher commodity prices. Our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA was $2.05 billion and exceeded the high end of our full year financial guidance range. 10:51 Targa generated adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.13 billion, which allowed us to reduce our leverage significantly across the year. At year end, our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.2 times. We spent $408 million in net growth capital during 2021 with spending largely focused on our Gathering and Processing business as we continue to benefit from operating leverage downstream. 11:17 We also had some spending shift from the fourth quarter to 2022, which is included in our 2022 growth capital estimate. Our net maintenance CapEx was about $130 million in 2021. During the fourth quarter, we recognized an approximate $452 million non-cash pretax impairment charge of our South Texas assets attributable to a lower outlook on future volumes. We are significantly hedged for 2022 and continue to add hedges for 2023 and beyond, while still benefiting from higher prices across our unhedged equity volume exposure and prices now well above fee floors. 11:53 We repurchased approximately $40 million of common shares in the fourth quarter and as of December 31, had approximately $369 million remaining under our $500 million share repurchase program. At year end, we had over $3.2 billion of available liquidity, which put us in excellent position to close on the repurchase of our DevCo joint venture interest for $925 million in January. 12:20 As Matt mentioned, we executed agreements to sell our 25% equity interest in GCX for $857 million. We expect to receive the full proceeds from the sale of GCX in the second quarter of 2022, and our current expectation is that we will utilize the GCX proceeds to redeem our outstanding TRC preferred shares. Last week, we closed on a $2.75 billion credit facility at Targa Resources Corp., eliminating the dual credit facilities at TRC and TRP as we continue to simplify our corporate structure. 12:54 Turning to our 2022 financial expectations. We estimate that pro forma for the sale of GCX full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, a 17% increase over 2021 based on the midpoint of our range. Comparing 2022 versus 2021, key drivers for EBITDA growth year-over-year include: a full year benefit from the repurchase of our DevCo interest; higher commodity prices and continued volume growth across our operations led by higher G&P volumes, primarily from our Permian assets; driving higher volumes across our transport, frac and export assets; and also higher fees across our contracts from inflation. 13:43 Offsets include the sale of GCX and higher estimated operating and G&A expenses from inflation and increasing volumes. As Matt described earlier, we are continuing to invest in attractive organic growth opportunities, including spending related to additional Permian plants, well connect and compression capital on the G&P side, additional pump station capital for Grand Prix and the expansion of our propane loading capabilities at Galena Park. We estimate 2022 net growth CapEx to be between $700 million and $800 million and net maintenance CapEx for 2022 of approximately $150 million. We currently expect year end 2022 leverage to be well within the bottom half of our long-term target range of 3 times to 4 times, providing us with significant flexibility. 14:32 For additional details related to our estimated 2022 outlook, please review our earnings supplement slides accompanying our webcast this morning, which are also posted to the Investors page of our website. Supported by our excellent operational and commercial performance through some very difficult environments over the last couple of years, we have been able to execute on our key strategies. And as Matt described, that means we are in an excellent position going forward. 14:57 Lastly, I would like to echo Matt's thank you to our employees that have continued to perform exceptionally well for our customers and have done so with a continued focus on safety. 15:08 And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Lad: 15:11 Thanks, Jen. For the Q&A session, we kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow up and re-enter the Q&A line-up, if you have additional questions. Chris, would you please open the line for Q&A?
Operator: 15:24 Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Mackay of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
John Mackay: 15:47 Hey, everyone. Thanks for the time. I wanted to start on capital allocation. I think you mentioned the GCX proceeds would kind of go first towards the prefs. You talked about kind of buying those back over kind of slightly longer period of time before. Should we think about that as you guys are trying to get them done kind of sooner now? And then maybe the second half of the year, the common buyback can pick up. Just how do you think about the balance of those two?
Jen Kneale: 16:16 I think our current assumption right now, John, is that with the proceeds received from GCX, we will be able to accelerate and potentially repurchase all of the preferred interest in the second quarter, that's the base case assumption that we're currently running. Of course, we'll maintain the flexibility to change course if we want, but that's the current assumption. And then related to common share repurchases, you saw us active in the fourth quarter based on our outperformance for 2021. And certainly, our expectation is that we'll be able to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders as we move through 2022 and beyond. We've got the common dividend set for this year. And so that means that our assumption is we'll continue to be opportunistic around common share repurchases. So it isn't necessarily that because we're accelerating the TRC prep takeout to the second quarter that changes our assumptions around common share repurchases, we think we've got a lot of flexibility to execute across all parameters.
John Mackay: 17:14 All right. Thanks for that. My follow-up is kind of on the CapEx side that fits in there. Can you just kind of frame up how much of the growth CapEx guide is going to the two new processing plants and also to the new export expansion? Just trying to think of those contributions above maybe a run rate level.
Matt Meloy: 17:33 Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We announced the Legacy II plant and the Midway plant this morning. We had highlight we were already ordering long lead time for Legacy II on our prior call. For this year, the Midway plant really was kind of an incremental from maybe what we had signaled previously. There was about $150 million of capital for that Midway plant almost all of that spending is in year, and then there's a little bit of capital, which would move into 2023. We'll still have significant spending on Legacy and Legacy II this year. And then we'll also have pump capital for Grand Prix, the export project. That export project is really more kind of a debottlenecking or a bolt-on. It's relatively small CapEx, which is why we really like that project. It gives us an incremental 1 million barrels a month of ability to load -- increase our capacity on the propane loading side for relatively modest capital. But the large movers are midway and then the spending on Legacy I and II.
John Mackay: 18:37 That’s great. Appreciate to them. Thank you.
Matt Meloy: 18:39 Okay. Thanks.
Operator: 18:41 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Michael Blum: 18:49 Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to stay on Grand Prix. Can you just give us a sense of where utilization sits on the kind of the Mid-Con and the Permian pieces of that type? And then how much are you planning to expand it and what's the timing?
Scott Pryor: 19:05 Hey, Mike. This is Scott Pryor. I'll first just state that we've got tremendous operating leverage when it comes to our downstream assets, and that's inclusive of our pipeline capacity relating to Grand Prix. When you look at the 433,000 barrels a day that we did in the fourth quarter, which was a record for us, we do have contributions that are coming from the North. We don't describe what those volumes are. But I would say that we still have a lot of leverage on our West leg and our South leg as well. We'll add pumps to West leg in the South leg dependent upon the production growth that we see in the Permian and from the North. We're going to stay well ahead of that to make sure that we can move all the volumes that are necessary. We can look at possibilities of loops in the future based upon the cadence as we hedge gas processing plants on our upstream side, again, with a lot of focus on the Permian Basin, but we'll also look for commercial opportunities that may present themselves with other existing pipes that might be in the Basin. So adding pumps, looking at opportunities, future puts us in a great position to leverage into what we have today and future growth.
Michael Blum: 20:21 Okay. Great. I appreciate that. And then maybe a question on the LPG export expansion you're announcing. Can you just remind us roughly kind of where you are on a contracted basis? And kind of what's leading your decision to expand here? And do you have -- will you continue to add contracts? In other words, will the contracted level as a percentage kind of stay the same as you increase the total capacity?
Scott Pryor: 20:49 Again, Michael, this is Scott. I'll restate kind of what Matt said. When you look at this project, it is a low capital type project. I would describe it less than $50 million. Barrel-per-barrel basis, it's our cheapest expansion that we can put in our system to debottleneck around Galena Park. When we look at the facilities that we're adding, we've got a tremendous contract structure today. We continue to have success with renewing contracts and adding contracts where necessary. The market growth potential continues to be strong. When you look at domestic use of LPG products where people -- developing countries are looking for clean burning fuels, this certainly supports that opportunity. And then obviously, you're going to see continued growth on the PDH side in the East with more focus on China. When I -- when you think about that and the continued success that we've had, really, this is a complementary type addition for us. 21:50 It puts us in a position to be more flexible, more reliable for our customers and our lifters that we have out of our facility. It gives us the ability to rebound from times of weather delays or fog delays or shipping delays that may happen, but it also provides us early, prior to increased production that we would see coming from the Permian into our assets, it provides us the ability to participate more heavily in the spot market when the market dictates and presents itself. So again, a nice bolt-on project, barrel for barrel with the cheapest add that we can do at this time, and we like how it complements, provides reliability to us and our customers that lift from us.
Michael Blum: 22:31 Thank you very much.
Matt Meloy: 22:33 Okay. Thanks, Michael.
Operator: 22:35 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis of Credit Suisse. Your line is open
Spiro Dounis: 22:46 Thanks, operator. Good morning, guys. First question, maybe just sticking with downstream CapEx, focusing a little bit more on fractionation. I believe you all have Frac nine as permitted. And so I'm just curious, given the rate of growth we're seeing here, is that something that's become a little bit more front of mind right now? And maybe just general thoughts on how you're thinking about the lead times for when that could come online and when you need to start acting on it?
Scott Pryor: 23:12 Again, this is Scott. I'll just start with it, again, the fact that we've got leverage on the downstream side as it relates to fractionation as well. So we've got current capacity today. We do have a permit in hand for Frac Train nine. So we will pay particularly close attention to the cadence of the processing plants that we add in the Permian Basin as well as third-party production that will be steered toward our downstream assets. So with that permit in hand, we can trigger a start up on that frac when necessary. We also have the ability to look at the restart of our Gulf Coast -- or excuse me, our Gulf Coast fractionator as it relates to our needs or the demand that we have with our partners at that facility. So again, we'll stay well ahead of the need. Having a permanent hand for Train nine certainly helps us and the ability to restart the idle frac with our partners is also a possibility.
Matt Meloy: 24:09 Yeah. And just to add to that too, Scott, I'd say we would also continue to look across Belvieu. So if there's some excess capacity from some of our competitors that could give us some more time to evaluate when we need to do Train nine, we can look at those solutions as well. So we're kind of looking at the volume growth and really have all options on the table for us.
Spiro Dounis: 24:31 Great. That's helpful. Switching gears a bit. I can't let you all go without asking you about natural gas, egress out of the Permian going forward. I think there's obviously a lot of projects potentially contending to be the next natural gas pipeline, whether it be expansion, a greenfield. Just curious, is it a concern of yours that somehow some of that growth gets stunted in any way. Do you think the industry will resolve the issue and how? And then you've obviously participated in some of these projects in the past, recognizing you just sold GCX, but is Targa interested maybe in participating in the future as well?
Matt Meloy: 25:05 Yeah. Sure. To start, I would say, yeah, we do see one certainly being needed, and it looks like it's coming sooner than maybe previous expectations. So we are looking to be part of the solution. We have a lot of gas. We want additional infrastructure to get built. So we're talking to a number of the pipes that are trying to basically get geared up to get to FID. We want to get something done. So we want to be supportive to be able to get something done. So I guess just stay tuned on that. We think the industry will solve it. It's added pipes before. And just stay tuned on how and when Targa is going to participate in that.
Spiro Dounis: 25:47 Got it. Helpful as always. Thanks, guys.
Matt Meloy: 25:49 Okay. Thanks.
Operator: 25:51 Thank you. Next, we have the line of Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Unidentified Participant: 26:08 Sorry, this is Steve (ph) jumping in for Jeremy. Sorry about that. Really just kind of one question for us. Most of them have kind of already been hit. So just looking at the 2022 EBITDA guide, commodity prices bring your guide to above the high end. And we just kind of want to know what other main moving pieces of the high end versus the low end of the guide are there?
Matt Meloy: 26:32 Yeah. I'd say as we gave a range, commodity prices, as I'd say, the largest variable. And then we also had a range in our Permian volumes, 12% to 15%. So depending on where volumes from the Permian shake out. We are seeing some drilling across the Central and in Badlands. So if prices stay here, we could see some additional upside to our Central as well. I'd say those are the main drivers on the G&P side. I'd say on the downstream side, the export, we see a continued strong export market. But I think there's still some upside to our assumption in our guidance number to exports. And if there's a real weak market, there's some potential. It's not all contracted. So there's some variability in exports as well.
Jen Kneale: 27:19 And we're doing a really good job of managing costs. So hopefully, there's upside to some of the conservative assumptions that we've made around cost. We'll have to see how those play out through the year.
Unidentified Participant: 27:31 All right, really appreciate you guys. Thank you.
Matt Meloy: 27:33Okay. Thank you.
Jen Kneale: 27:35 Thank you.
Operator: 27:36 Thank you. And next, we have a question from the line of Tristan Richardson of Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Tristan Richardson: 27:44 Hi. Good morning, guys. Just curious on the contracting environment, just in -- what we're seeing in the strong commodity today, and as you bring on additional plants. Are you seeing from producers a desire to retain more of the economics pushing more towards the -- obviously, you guys have done a lot over the past couple of years, incorporating some changes in the contracting styles? But maybe just the landscape today in this current environment, what types of structures are your customers looking for?
Matt Meloy: 28:17 Yeah. I'd say we're -- most of our growth is happening out in the Permian. Yes, there are some differences between the Delaware and the Midland. On the Midland side, that has been traditionally more POP, although we've done a good job at putting more fee-based components and fee floors on those POP. We have a lot of acreage dedicated to us under long-term contracts. And so a lot of the growth that we're seeing is under already existing longer-term contracts in and around that area. On the Delaware side, we do have more fee-based components on the Delaware side, but I'd say a lot of the volumes there for the growth is under long-term contracts. So it's really keeping the mix kind of similar to what we've had there. Pat, I don't know if there's anything you'd want to add to that.
Pat McDonie: 29:05 I think the only thing I would add, Matt, is that there's so many variables that affect how you contract, right? Is it sour gases? Is it sweet gas? Is it high pressure? Is it low pressure? And certainly, the Midland and Delaware Basin have some nuances related to some of those variables. But generally, the contracting hasn't materially changed. And as Matt described it, it was kind of spot on relative to the basins and how they break down. And we haven't seen a material change in and the way we're contracting.
Matt Meloy: 29:39 Yes. Thanks, Pat.
Tristan Richardson: 29:40 That's helpful. And then just a follow-up. Jen, I may have missed this, but -- and appreciating you guys offered the sensitivities for the '22 budget, but can you talk maybe about the hedge position where you sit today and for '22? And then maybe also just what 2023 looks like just from a -- where you stand today?
Jen Kneale: 29:58 Sure, Tristan. We changed our disclosures around hedging just because we found that we are creating potentially more confusion than we were helping folks work through our numbers. So really, from our perspective, the sensitivity is what's most meaningful to you. And that's our result. We do have our equity volumes from our percent of proceeds contracts, but then we also have our fee floor contracts, and fee floors are set at different levels. So there's just a lot that goes into now, I think, figuring out what our position is. But I think we have excellent cash flow stability because we are very well hedged. The last disclosures that we gave showed that we were north of 75% hedged across all commodities for 2022 and then had already put significant hedges on in 2023. So I think importantly, we aren't changing our hedge program at all. So the expectation is we will continue to look to hedge our equity volume exposure 75% next 12 months out, 50% 12 months out after that, and then 25% the 12 months out after that. So none of that has changed. But we really thought that just providing a simple sensitivity provided you with the most clarity relative to all the moving pieces around our Gathering and Processing contracts and positions.
Tristan Richardson: 31:18 Appreciate it. Thank you, guys, very much.
Matt Meloy: 31:22 Okay. Thanks, Tristan.
Jen Kneale: 31:23 Thank you.
Operator: 31:23 Thank you. Next, we have questions from the line of Colton Bean from Tudor Pickering. Your line is open.
Jen Kneale: 31:39 Hey, Colton. Good morning.
Colton Bean: 31:38 Sorry about that. Good morning. So just on the balance sheet, would love to understand any shift in how you're thinking about optimal leverage. I think you've said previously you wouldn't want to drop below 3 times debt to EBITDA, but it looks like you closed out 2021 at 3.2. And then just the year-on-year EBITDA increase alone, looks like it will drive leverage below that threshold before considering retained free cash flow. So are you thinking about a lower target at this point or considering an alternative cash outlay that might offset that?
Jen Kneale: 32:09 I think we're really comfortable within the target range of 3 times to 4 times. And I've said that our strong preference is to exist towards the bottom end of that range. That doesn't mean that we have to stop at an exact number, but our goal is to really operate within the lower end of that range. So are we comfortable going sub 3 times for a quarter or a couple of quarters potentially, but I think we'll also be able to identify some attractive uses of that leverage capacity to be able to return incremental capital to shareholders, to be able to continue to invest in the business? It's been a while since we looked at M&A opportunities. But certainly, I think with our balance sheet, where we are, are continuing to look at attractive bolt-on opportunities, too. So there isn't a change to how we're thinking about capital allocation. I think just the outperformance that we had in 2021 and now the expected performance in 2022 just provides us with even more flexibility than we thought we would have even a quarter or a couple of quarters ago. So the outperformance in 2021, that's part of what drove us repurchasing $40 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit earlier than estimates. But we felt like we had the capacity to do so and opportunistically executed on that. So I think, again, flexibility just means that we've got more places that we can identify the best use of that available cash flow or leverage capacity and then go execute on that strategy.
Colton Bean: 33:38 Got it. So looking out over the next couple of years, is it reasonable to assume that the incremental leverage capacity from that organic growth and then the amount of free cash that the business is throwing off, first call might be capital returns and the second, opportunistic M&A?
Jen Kneale: 33:53 I don't think that we exist with if you do A, then you can do B. If you do B, then you can go to C, right? I think you've seen us over the last couple of years really just execute across opportunities. And so that's going to be the strategy going forward, Colton. So to the extent that we've got more organic growth or M&A opportunities that are attractive, we're definitely planning on continuing to invest in this business. We think that's what sets Targa up best for the short, medium and long term for our investors. And then we also believe that we'll be able to return increasing capital to our shareholders. Year-over-year, 2022 common dividend versus '21 dividend, we're doing that. We've talked about the fact that we expect that we'll be able to increase the dividend going forward as well in 2023. So that's definitely part of how we'll return incremental capital to our investors. And then also we'll continue to be opportunistic around our common share repurchase program, but it's going to be a combination of everything that's available to us.
Colton Bean: 34:51 Got it. Appreciate the time.
Jen Kneale: 34:54 Thank you.
Matt Meloy: 34:55 Okay. Thank you.
Operator: 34:56 Thank you. Next, we have the line of Keith Stanley of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Keith Stanley: 35:06 Hi. Good morning. Two follow-up questions. The first one, just to clarify on hedging, and appreciate the policy as the same and the percentage targets for each year. Can you just remind us how you typically hedge gas basis? Is it at the same time, you're hedging your broader gas price exposure or are you more opened on gas basis?
Matt Meloy: 35:30 Yeah. Sure. When we hedge our equity volumes, we hedge really as close to where we sell the physical as we can. So for example, we'll sell Waha and other indices out in the Permian, and we'll sell other Mid-Con indices where we have length on gas. So we cover off the basis as best we can for the volumes that we are trying to hedge.
Keith Stanley: 35:55 Great. And second follow-up was on the commentary about not really being in the market for acquisitions as much in the past few years and maybe being more open to that. Can you give a little more color on things you would look at? I assume tuck-in type Permian G&P opportunities, would you look at anything outside the Permian? And I guess one thought I had too is, is there any potential with the DevCo now done to buy in the rest of the Grand Prix stake or is that unlikely?
Matt Meloy: 36:25 Sure. I'll give you some color there. We've, I'd say, kind of been actively looking at bolt-on, tuck-in acquisitions across our footprint. I'd say we just continue to have a high hurdle. It's not that nothing can cross over that hurdle. But as we look at acquisitions, we want to make sure we're staying within our leverage range. We want to make sure that we have good synergies on the G&P side and on the NGL side. We're in a good position where we don't need to acquire anything. So it's really got to be additive. It's got to be at a good value for us with synergies that drive that value down even more. So I'd say there are opportunities and things we're looking at, but we've -- that really hasn't changed. We've been looking at things for the last several years. There's opportunities in the Permian. There's also opportunities in other basins as well. And if it checks all those boxes of keeping our leverage where we need to be, good upfront value with G&P synergies and downstream synergies, a lot of those bolt-on or tuck-ins could look a lot like organic growth projects by the time you're done with them. So those are -- that's kind of how we're thinking about it, how we're looking at it. So I think, stay tuned, we'll see if anything meets all those -- it's a pretty high bar. We'll see if anything meets that. But if it does, there could be something there.
Keith Stanley: 37:52 Thank you.
Matt Meloy: 37:53 Okay. Thank you.
Operator: 37:56 Thank you. Next on the line, we have Theresa Chen of Barclays. Your line is open.
Theresa Chen: 38:02 Hi. I just wanted to follow up on the M&A line of commentary, if you don't mind. In terms of valuation of the things that you have been looking at for years, Matt, how has that trended recently given the commodity price outlook? And just more specifically, are there areas of the value chain or region-specific aspects that you're considering that would be most complementary to your existing footprint?
Matt Meloy: 38:30 Yeah. I'd say on the valuation trends, it really depends on what you're looking at. So I consider us to be opportunistic on the buy side, but we're also opportunistic on the sell side, right? So we sold GCX at 11 times multiple. We thought that was a strong market there for that. But I would say for other assets that don't have that cash flow, kind of take-or-pay cash flow feature, it's -- over time, I think those multiples have trended down, but we haven't transacted on anything. So I can't really say how they've moved over the years. But for non-highly contracted assets where it makes sense for a financial buyer, I would expect the multiple to be significantly less than where we transacted GCX.
Jen Kneale: 39:19 And just to repeat, there really isn't a difference in the strategy here, as Matt, I think importantly articulated, we've been looking at M&A opportunities all along, and the hurdle has continued to be very, very high, and that hasn't really changed. All that's changed is our balance sheet is a whole lot stronger now than it was a year ago or two years ago. And that just provides us with more flexibility as we consider opportunities. But the strategy really hasn't changed.
Theresa Chen: 39:45 Thank you.
Matt Meloy: 39:46 Okay. Thank you.
Operator: 39:49 Thank you. Next, we have the line of Chase Mulvehill of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Chase Mulvehill: 39:58 Yeah. Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in here. A few questions. I guess the first one is really just a follow-up to Keith's questions about -- the question around Waha basis spread. How much do you actually have hedged in 2023 for basis risk?
Matt Meloy: 40:21 So when we have our equity hedges, we're, call it, 75% and then 50% hedged for our position on our equity position. We have some transport that also provides us ability to move our gas out in various directions. We have a gas marketing team that manages that portfolio very actively to make sure we have contracted takeaway.
Chase Mulvehill: 40:46 Okay. All right. So it sounds like you got some FT (ph) on some pipes and maybe you could actually benefit from that. So would you say that there is -- the benefit is greater than the risk when you think about Waha basis for you?
Matt Meloy: 41:02 Chase, our primary focus for our gas is to make sure volumes are moving out of the basin. For us and for our producers, that is our focus to make sure we have a market that we can get to, that is our focus, and that is kind of how we manage that overall gas position. We want gas to move and we try and do it as best we can for us and for our producers.
Chase Mulvehill: 41:25 Okay. All right. A follow-up question, and I apologize if this was asked, but I don't think it was. But 4Q Midland volumes were down a smidge in the fourth quarter, and Delaware volumes were actually up pretty strongly, up 12% quarter-over-quarter. I guess two questions. Number one, you dropped below nameplate capacity. So should we think about -- in the Midland. Should we think that kind of running above nameplate capacity is tough to do consecutive quarters? And then number two is, were you able to move some Midland volumes over to Delaware, and that's why Delaware really saw a nice uptick in the fourth quarter?
Matt Meloy: 42:10 Yeah. Sure. So I'll start on that, and then -- for Q4, so if you're comparing to our reported in Q3, it would look like it's down. If you look at what we reported, it's in the supplement. It's actually we see an increase of about 2% on our Midland volumes. There was a kind of production month accounting change from some volumes that were in October into -- and from September into October, which changed it. So we actually saw when it was corrected volume growth in Q4 on the Midland side. As far as nameplate, we have the ability to run over nameplate. You've seen us do that. It can provide us good flexibility. We actually updated what we estimate our nameplate really to be for our plants. We used to call these 250s. We've been running them for over that and haven't seen a degradation in NGL recoveries or operational performance. So we're calling them 275s now. So we still have good flexibility across our system to continue to operate. So we -- so to be clear, we saw growth in the Midland in Q4, and we expect to see growth in Midland kind of throughout the balance of the year.
Chase Mulvehill: 43:19 Okay. Perfect. Thanks, Matt.
Matt Meloy: 43:21 Okay. Thanks, Chase
Operator: 43:24 Thank you. And next, we have the line of Sunil Sibal of Seaport Securities. Your line is open.
Sunil Sibal: 43:33 Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So my first question was a little bit of a follow-up on Permian. So when we think about the 12% to 15% volume growth in 2022, could you give us a sense where that is kind of skewed more towards Delaware versus Midland, especially in light of some of the commentary we are hearing from some of your producers in the Midland?
Matt Meloy: 43:59 Sure. We did not provide a detailed breakout of that. I'd say we see growth on both Delaware and the Midland. So we see pretty strong activity across both areas of our system. And so yeah, we see growth in both areas.
Sunil Sibal: 44:20 So you wouldn't handicap that 12% to 15% to be weighted towards any specific part of Permian?
Matt Meloy: 44:26 We haven't given that color. I think you'll see it as we report going forward. But no, we haven't provided a kind of basin level detailed breakout. But we do see meaningful growth in both, and we see strong growth continuing in the Midland, which is why we're adding those plants, but we also see growth in the Delaware.
Sunil Sibal: 44:44 Got it. And then one bit of a broader question. I think in the past, you have talked about some of energy transition investment opportunities. Obviously, I think the solar generation that you're looking at, you're doing at -- to provide a balance sheet. I was just curious, has that kind of opportunity set expanded for you guys or what is on radar screen currently?
Matt Meloy: 45:12 Yeah. I'd say we are continuing to look at opportunities in and around energy transition. We're continuing to look at renewable deals, whether it's additional solar or additional wind deals. We're continuing to be active to see if we can be part of the solution that way. Like, I said before, I think for those projects, it's unlikely we put our capital on those projects, but we could provide some offtake to help get those underwritten. So we're currently evaluating additional renewable projects on that front. We're also continuing to develop our carbon capture out in and around our assets. So we're continuing to make progress on that. That is going to take a while. So we are making progress. There are some hurdles. There's some -- there's permitting, there's just things that need to get done, but we are working through those. And I think we still are optimistic that we can get something done there in carbon capture. Part of it does depend on where is the 45Q going to settle out, and there was talk for a while of it going up 80. So is it going to be 80 or is it going to be 50? Those kind of things matter as well. So we're going to continue to work to try and develop the operational hurdles and get through that, and then we'll have to make the call on whether it makes financial sense for us or we need to source third-party capital.
Sunil Sibal: 46:31 Got it. Thanks for that.
Matt Meloy: 46:33 Okay. Thank you.
Operator: 46:36 Thank you. And I see no further questions in the queue. I will turn it back over to Mr. Sanjay Lad for closing remarks.
Sanjay Lad: 46:45 Thanks to everyone that was on the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thanks, and have a great day.
Operator: 46:57 This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.

Matt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning to everyone. This is a very exciting time at Targa, as highlighted by our earnings release this morning. Operationally, we continue to perform well and now expect to exceed all our volume guidance expectations for the year. Financially, our balance sheet is as strong as it's ever been, with our leverage in the midpoint of our target range and expectations for it to continue to trend lower. Strategically, several of our key areas of focus over the last several years are driving the strength of our results and are positioning looking forward; fully integrating our NGL business from wellhead to water, moving to a G&P contract structure that allows us to protect downside while continuing to participate from strong commodity prices and managing capital spending to focus on projects that leverage our integrated NGL platform and drive higher returns. The culmination of the successful execution of the Targa strategy gives me confidence to say that we are now where we want to be from a strategic and financial standpoint. Over the years, we invested outsized capital relative to the size of our company to fully integrate our business and create a best-in-class midstream footprint for our customers. These capital investments stretched our balance sheet more than we would have liked, but we believe those decisions would position us to generate significant long-term shareholder value, and we are now in a position where we are seeing the benefits of those previous strategic investments. We are also now in a position to unwind some of the structured financings that we utilized to finance our growth, and we will be able to do so while maintaining our leverage comfortably in our target range. Our EBITDA, free cash flow and balance sheet are as strong as they have ever been. And we now expect to exceed the top end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2021 and see continued growth thereafter underpinned by attractive organic growth opportunities that are integrated high return projects. All of this puts us in position to return additional capital to our shareholders. We plan to recommend to our board $1.40 per common share annual dividend or $0.35 per quarter effective for the fourth quarter of this year and payable in February 2022. This equates to approximately 30% of our 2021 free cash flow and provides a yield competitive to members in the S&P 400 and S&P 500. We would expect to be able to increase the dividend, a modest amount, going forward on an annual basis. This level of common dividend returns additional capital to shareholders while providing us significant financial flexibility across cycles. For 2022, our current expectation is to direct free cash flow after dividends toward the repurchase of our DevCo joint venture interest. While continuing to closely manage our balance sheet, we believe we will have the flexibility to redeem preferred stock and opportunistically repurchase common shares under the $500 million share repurchase program. Before I move to discuss our operational performance, I want to acknowledge the continued outstanding efforts of our Targa employees. Throughout pandemic, hurricanes, storms and other issues, our employees have performed exceptionally well and we are so proud of their efforts. Let us now turn to our operational performance and business outlook. Starting in the Permian, third quarter system inlet volumes increased 7% sequentially, and we now expect our average 2021 Permian inlet to exceed the top end of our previously disclosed 5% to 10% growth range over 2020. In Permian Midland, our new 200 million cubic feet per day Heim Plant, which began full operations in early September, is currently running near full, and our next 250 million cubic feet per day Legacy Plant remains on track to begin operations during the fourth quarter of 2022. With robust activity levels expected to continue into next year and beyond, we are evaluating the timing of our next Midland Plant after Legacy and are now ordering long lead items. In Permian Delaware, completions and activity levels continue to ramp and we currently have adequate processing capacity to accommodate our anticipated near to medium term growth. The stronger outlook across our Permian Basin footprint will continue to drive incremental volumes through our NGL downstream business. And in our Central region, we are seeing an uptick in activity levels given the higher commodity price environment and remained optimistic around higher production, offsetting Legacy decline on many of our systems. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment, Grand Prix volumes continue to increase and we transported a record 417,000 barrels per day to Mont Belvieu during the third quarter. Throughput volumes on Grand Prix sequentially increased 6% driven by increasing NGL production from Targa's Permian plant, including our new Heim Plant and third-parties. We also achieved record fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex averaging about 662,000 barrels per day during the third quarter, representing a 3% sequential increase. Our LPG Export Services business, third quarter volumes averaged 9 million barrels per month. Lower sequential volumes were attributable to general maintenance we chose to complete at our Galena Park export facility during the quarter, while it was an overall weaker global LPG market. The last couple of years have presented a number of challenges and we think that we have demonstrated the ability for Targa to perform exceptionally well across volatile markets with record 2020 adjusted EBITDA and expectation for a record 2021 adjusted EBITDA and current expectations for record 2022 adjusted EBITDA. So I will finish with another thank you to all of our employees. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jen.
Jen Kneale: Thanks, Matt. I would also like to give a big thank you to all of our employees. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $506 million, increasing 10% sequentially as we benefited from higher commodity prices including upside from fee floor volumes and higher volumes across our integrated Permian gathering, processing and logistics and transportation systems. Year-to-date 2021 Targa has generated adjusted free cash flow of $893 million, which has allowed us to reduce our leverage significantly across the year. We are highly hedged for 2021 and continue to add hedges for 2022 and beyond, while still benefiting from higher prices across our unhedged equity volume exposure and prices above fee floors. For 2022, we have now hedged about 85% of natural gas, 75% of NGLs and 75% of condensate. We are continuing to hedge into price strength and have added 2022 hedges at higher weighted average hedge prices. For 2023, we are around 50% hedged across all commodities. You can find our usual hedge disclosures in our quarterly earnings supplement presentation. As Matt mentioned, we now expect to be above the top end of our full year estimated 2021 adjusted EBITDA range of $1.9 billion to $2 billion. Increasing activity levels across our Permian systems and additional visibility to 2022, we now estimate our 2021 net growth CapEx to be toward the high end of our $350 million to $450 million range as we are ordering long lead items for our next Midland Basin plan. As we think about 2022 growth capital, our expectation is that it will be higher than 2021 with continued spending largely around additional plant, well connect and compression capital on the G&P side plus additional pump station capital for Grand Prix. Our full year net maintenance CapEx estimate remains unchanged at approximately $120 million. Our balance sheet is strong with a consolidated leverage ratio of about 3.5 times and we have significant liquidity with no near-term debt maturities. We now expect to end 2021 with consolidated leverage around 3.25 times and pro forma for our $925 million DevCo repurchase in January 2022, we expect to comfortably be within our target range of 2 to 4 times. Our outperformance year-to-date and balance sheet flexibility position us to begin returning incremental capital to our shareholders. In 2021, we focused on reducing leverage. In 2022, with the strength of our balance sheet, our focus shifts to simplifying our capital structure and returning more capital to shareholders. Complemented by our plans to recommend a meaningful increase to our common dividend in early 2022, we will continue to remain opportunistic around common and preferred share repurchases, and we'll continue to invest in attractive high returning growth opportunities that leverage our integrated system. Our recommendation to increase the common dividend to $1.40 per share annualized with the culmination of a lot of comparable company and industry analysis as well as scenario analysis. We believe that at $1.40, Targa offers an attractive common dividend per share that will provide for a stable return of cash flow to our shareholders across cycles. Our initial increase of the common dividend will be effective for the fourth quarter of 2021 and we expect to maintain that dividend level through the fourth quarter of 2022. Beyond 2022, we expect to provide modest increases to our annual common dividend per share and currently expect to articulate the next change to our dividend concurrent with providing our annual guidance in February 2023. We have worked very hard to improve our balance sheet and we remain focused on preserving our strong balance sheet and maintaining consolidated leverage of 3 to 4 times over the longer term. We are continuing our dialogue with the rating agencies with a focus toward achieving investment-grade rating, which is a priority for Targa. This week, Moody's upgraded us to Ba1. So we are now one notch from investment-grade at all three agencies. Shifting to sustainability and ESG. We recently published our third annual sustainability report. And we continue to advance Targa's sustainability disclosures with the report providing a review of our performance against various environmental, social and governance topics that are important to our industry. Also, as announced a couple of days ago, we entered into agreements to source renewable electricity from Concho Valley Solar to provide power to our G&P infrastructure in the Permian Basin. We continue to review and pursue other economic opportunities to advance our sustainability objectives that complement our core competencies and infrastructure footprint. In closing, we are so very proud of our Targa team. Our employees have continued to perform exceptionally well for our customers and have done so with a continued focus on safety, and we are very thankful for their efforts. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks, Jen. For the Q&A session, we kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up and reenter the line-up if you have additional questions. Ruel, would you please open the lines for Q&A. Ruel, would you please open the line.
Operator: I'm sorry. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Jeremy Tonet from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Matt Meloy: Hey, good morning, Jeremy.
Jen Kneale: Good morning, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: Great to see the rating agencies starting to pay attention to the improving metrics here. But I want to focus more on the 2022 outlook here, and just wondering if you could provide us more color on what you're seeing as far as producer activity in your footprint is concerned. This year we've seen kind of a bifurcation of private versus publics with the privates being more aggressive. Do you see similar trends like that continuing into 2022 or is there anything different there? And I think you've talked about processing plant every 18 months or so. Is that still kind of the current expectation?
Matt Meloy: Yes. Hey, Jeremy. I'd say, it really is probably more of the same from us for our larger E&Ps and larger publics and integrated. They are really sticking more or less with what they have told us. They have some ranges in their forecast they give us, but more or less are kind of sticking to the plans that they have. And we are still seeing a lot of the uptick in activity from the smaller and private guys really across our systems. I don't see a big change happening there. And then in terms of adding processing plants, last call we talked about adding the Legacy Plant, we just had Heim Plant come online, and we're ordering long lead times now for the next plant in the Permian Midland. So as we're really working through our, I'd say, capital budgeting and planning for 2022, we're ordering long lead times so we can be ready. We're not sure exactly when we think we'll need the next plant after Legacy, so we're still kind of in that evaluation phase, but we want to be ready in there for customers when it comes in. So I guess, stay tuned. When we think that next plant will come in, we would likely announce more specifics around timing on the next earnings call.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And maybe just touching on capital allocation, great to see the dividend show up a little bit early and ahead of what we were looking for. But just wondering if you could just walk us through maybe the priorities of the waterfall here. It seems like you're able to do multiple things at once, but just kind of curious if that's how you think about it or how you prioritize? And just when it comes to buybacks, is it just going to be solely opportunistic or could there be some programmatic side to it?
Matt Meloy: Sure. I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Jen to provide some more details there. As we look through the strength of this year, we saw our volumes and just overall business performance going very well with some commodity price tailwinds. As we kind of looked through – even our outlook continuing to be very strong. I think we found ourselves in a position in the midpoint of our leverage range where we said, we're here, we don't necessarily need to wait till next quarter to be more specific around returning capital to shareholders. And so that really is kind of signaling a bit of a shift from debt repayment, which is what we've been focused on. We're now in the middle of our leverage range and forecasting to get toward the lower end of it by year end to now wanting to return capital to shareholders. So the first step in that was moving the dividend to a more reasonable level. We looked at our S&P 400 and 500. We looked at our peers across the space and felt that that was an appropriate amount which allowed us to grow while providing financial flexibility. And that financial flexibility does give us the opportunity to continue to return capital to shareholders through simplifying repurchasing the preferred and opportunistic share repurchases. So we felt like that was kind of a good start along the way. Jen, any other color just how you think about opportunistic?
Jen Kneale: I'd say, Jeremy, clearly the near-term priority is now we're in excellent position to take out the DevCos in January and leverage will move a little bit higher when we do that, but then we expect to leverage to come down thereafter as we benefit from increasing EBITDA, not only in company's assets. but from the rest of the business. And that's what's really going to drive a lot of the flexibility that we see us having in 2022 that will allow us to return capital to our shareholders in a variety of ways. The simplification is still an important part of this for us though, and that starts with the DevCo and then also taking out the preferred. And that's what we'll largely be focused on in 2022. But again, I think we now have the flexibility to think about a go forward where we've got increasing EBITDA, which allows us to return more capital through both increasing dividends and potentially decreasing share count. And that's what we'll be focused on as we go forward through time, assuming a continued strong balance sheet.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.
Jen Kneale: Thanks, Jeremy.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is now open.
Shneur Gershuni: Good morning, everyone. From my perspective, not a lot of big picture questions. I think you guys have really answered the questions on return of capital, dividend increases today, timing of simplification. Congratulations on that, very much appreciated. Maybe just some smaller type questions. First of all, just with respect to the ramp in the Permian and so forth, appreciate the color that you gave, privates version publics. Wondering if you can talk about it more geographically. Any sense on how the ramp is going to work in the Delaware? Are you seeing any increased activity there or some shifts and so forth? Just kind of wondering if anything has kind of changed in terms of producer conversations or activity around that.
Matt Meloy: Yeah, sure. So Pat McDonie, our President of G&P elaborate there.
Pat McDonie: I think it's pretty csonsistent across both the Midland side of the basin and the Delaware side of the basin. We're seeing the steady growth from the large publics, as Matt alluded to, and we're seeing more activity levels in both the Delaware and the Midland side of the basin from the smaller guys. And certainly, when you look at rig count adds, etc., it kind of indicates that there's probably a little more lag in the Delaware than there is in the Midland side of the basin. But certainly, in our conversations with those parties we contracted with, they're definitely ramping up in some form or fashion. Not crazy ramp up, but good, thoughtful investment of capital. So that's what we're seeing right now.
Shneur Gershuni: Great. Thank you for that. And then as a follow-up question, obviously, there's a lot going on from an inflation perspective right now. Many of your peers have talked about the fact that they have PPI or CPI style in players and the vast majority of their contracts, whether it's G&P, whether it's long haul pipes and so forth. Kind of curious if you can update us on where receipts in that respect. We have an inflator adjuster in there. Do your contracts in the Permian in general have those types inflators as well too?
Jen Kneale: Shneur, this is Jen. I think similar to a lot of our peers, we have escalators across our contracts both in G&P and also in Logistics and Transportation. So we would expect going forward that we're in that beneficiary of inflation. And so that's part of what would be a potential tailwind for us next year and then the go forward after that.
Shneur Gershuni: Taking the time today.
Jen Kneale: Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Christine Cho from Barclays. Your line is now open.
Mark Devries: This is Mark on for Christine. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on your discussions with the rating agencies. Obviously, with the continued strong results, it seems like you're well on your way to IG. But just curious how you're thinking about the path forward? And then as a second part to that, it would seem like you're trending below your long-term leverage target for next year. So could that open up capacity for share repurchases or how should we think about that?
Jen Kneale: Mark, this is Jen. I think that we are in an excellent dialogue with the rating agencies. I think from our perspective, we already have strong investment-grade metrics. And so have spent a lot of time with the agencies to make sure that they understand what our short, medium and long-term strategies are and really get comfortable with the direction that we're headed in. And I think with the recent upgrades from S&P and now Moody's, they're recognizing the progress that we've continued to make. And then Fitch with their initial rating, I think spent a lot of time with us to understand where we are and what the vision was going forward. So I think we're in a good position with all three. What has been articulated to us is that the DevCo repurchase in their minds is an important step for us in our simplification. So we'll do that in January of 2022. Leverage will move a little bit higher just as a result of where leverage is now and where we expect it to be at year end and then we'd expect it to come down thereafter. So I think we're really well positioned. And our hope is that it will be a 2022 event that we become investment-grade. And then obviously, we don't control the timing of that, but we’ll continue to be in dialogue with the agencies to figure out what the appropriate timing is for us. And then related to the second part of your question, can you just remind me what that was?
Mark Devries: Just that you’re trending below your long-term leverage target for next year. So does that open up any capacity for share repurchases or how should we just think about that?
Jen Kneale: I think, hopefully, what you’ve heard from us this morning is that we’re really excited about where we’re positioned today and the flexibility that that affords us going forward. We focused on reducing leverage this year. And you’ve heard already that in our minds there is a shift in 2022 where we’re able to return more capital to our shareholders. And to the extent we are able to continue to manage leverage where it is and where we expect it to go, I think that increases our flexibility to do a lot of different things that will improve the return of capital to our shareholders and increase the value of Targa as we move through time.
Mark Devries: Great. Appreciate that. And then looks like your implied G&P fees came in pretty strong again this quarter. How should we think about that going forward into 2022? It looks like you are above the fee floor levels at this point. And should we think there is a cap to how much upside the volumes on these contracts can participate in?
Matt Meloy: Yes. So you are correct in that our fee floors were put in place to protect the downside. And right now, our average NGL is around $1.06 and gas prices are much higher than they were last year. So we are above the fee floors on our POP contract. So the way those generally work is they’re still POP contracts, percentage-of-proceeds, just has a fee floor in them. So as prices will continue to move up, it will look like a regular POP contract.
Mark Devries: Great. Thanks for the time.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Jen Kneale: Thanks, Mark.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Colton Bean from Tudor Pickering. Your line is now open.
Colton Bean: Great. So I’ll stick with the leverage theme there. So Jen, you mentioned exiting 2021 near the low end, it seems likely that you’ll be able to fund the DevCo buying with free cash. So even if there is a little bit of a tick higher in early parts of the year as you move through the balance of 2022 and certainly to 2023, it seems likely that you’ll be below that 3x to 4x range. So just conceptually, can you update us how you think about the appropriate level of debt on the business? Should we expect an updated leverage target over time? Really just interested in kind of broader thoughts there.
Jen Kneale: Our long-term target is 3x to 4x, Colton, and that’s not something that I would expect that we’ll be updating. We’re very comfortable within the 3x to 4x range. That doesn’t mean that we couldn’t have quarters or quarters where we’re lower or even higher than that. I think we’re very comfortable existing anywhere around that zip code. To the extent we’re in the lower end or even below, that gives us more flexibility. So we’ll just be continuing to manage our balance sheet as we go through time. But again, very comfortable within the 3x to 4x range and that’s really over the long-term where we expect to manage the business.
Colton Bean: Got it. And then just on the Series A, any thoughts as to the cadence we should expect over the course of 2022 there?
Jen Kneale: The base plan that we have right now is that we’ll ratably take it out beginning really in the second quarter after it steps down to 105, and that will continue until, call it, the end of 2023 when it will be fully redeemed at that point in time. But to the extent that we want to take some out sooner, we obviously have that flexibility. So that’s a lever that we’ll be able to pull as we move through 2022 just depending on the performance of the business and the outlook for the business.
Colton Bean: Great. I appreciate the time.
Jen Kneale: Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of John Mackay from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
John Mackay: Hey, good morning. Congrats from me as well on the dividend and the capital allocation investment. Wanted to touch on the 2022 CapEx comment, signaled at little higher year-over-year. Just curious if you could kind of talk about how much of that is from increasing activity? You mentioned the Midland plants and Grand Prix pumps, but is there any of that also coming from any inflation on the sourcing side? Thanks.
Matt Meloy: Yes. No, really I think as we look for 2022 CapEx, it’s really more related to our – this increase in activity out in the Permian. We’re looking to exceed our guidance on volumes for this year, ordering long lead times, it looks like we’re going to have more plant capital as you get into 2022, and then also, it’s just more volumes, more gathering compression pipelines and the like. So I’d say it’s more related to that. We are seeing some higher costs for steel and other things. The team has done a really good job for whether it’s Legacy or even this next plant we’re kind of getting in the Q4 are trying to manage that as best we can. There will be some pressures on that, but I’d say it’s primarily related to more activity than just inflation.
John Mackay: All right. That’s helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just following-up on your comments around the export downtime this quarter. Just curious if, one, you could kind of frame-up how much of the lower margin, lower volumes quarter-over-quarter was the downtime versus shifts in kind of the overall macro? And then maybe you can kind of just give us a snapshot maybe on where exports sit right now? Thanks.
Matt Meloy: Sure. Scott Pryor can handle that one.
Scott Pryor: Hey, John. Yes, as it relates to the third quarter, first of all, we performed on our term-related contracts as it relates to that working with all of our term customers. But we opted to do the maintenance at our facility during the quarter. And really doing that against the backdrop of the fact that there was a softer market globally and the result of really less arb opportunity. So we foregoed, if you will, the opportunity to sell some additional spot cargos across our dock. That teases up very well as we move into the fourth quarter domestically. Prices have kind of stabilized here. We’ve seen increases in the arb and the opportunities across the market to the Far East and other areas. So I think it puts us in good position obviously to perform very well in the fourth quarter, not only for our term-related contracts, but taking advantage of the opportunity to move additional spots across the dock. So I think we’re in good position there.
John Mackay: I appreciate that. Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thanks, John.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Spiro Dounis from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, everyone. This is Doug on for Spiro. Maybe just to start on one on margins, a few peers have talks this quarter about frac T&F becoming more competitive in the Permian. Just wondering if you’re seeing similar pressure on margins? And if so, kind of what it takes to scale back toward midstream?
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure. Right now, I would agree with that assessment that the T&F market is very competitive. There is excess capacity. And so new deals that are coming, it’s very competitive, and there’s a lot of competition to get the marginal barrel there. I’d say the good thing for Targa is we have, we are underpinned by either long-term contracts if it’s a T&F agreement. We have long-terms, a lot of them are 10-plus years, our longer term T&F contracts. And then in our Gathering and Processing business, we have long-term contracts on the G&P side. So most of the volumes that are coming and most of the volumes that are underpinning our growth are already contracted for multiple years to come. So I’d say, while we are in that same market, we’re still very well positioned for the next several years because of our contract structure.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just to follow-up on the dividend, realized the next decision is a little ways away, but this quarter you kind of referenced that 30% of free cash flow around the dividend increase. As we look towards what the next increase could look like, is that a good reference point to think about? Are there other metrics you’re looking at in terms of determining how big of an increase you could see next time?
Jen Kneale: Doug, this is Jen. When we think about 2022, there is still a little bit for us to continue to work through related to the corporate simplification, right? So primary use of free cash flow in 2022 will be the DevCo repurchase. As we think about beyond that, I think we’ll wait to articulate more about our plans. We tried to give a reference point that said that setting the dividend at $1.40 for the fourth quarter we were looking at how much of 2021 free cash flow that represented and are very comfortable with the dividend that approximates to call it 30% of this year’s free cash flow. But as we move through time, that could change. And so I’d say that that’s something that we will continue to evaluate. We have said that we think that we will be in position to return more capital to shareholders as we move through time. And so how much free cash flow that means we are comfortable paying out on any given year will be dependent on our performance for that year and then our expectations for the go forward as well.
Unidentified Analyst: All right, great. That is all from me. Thank you.
Jen Kneale: Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Michael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I think I know the answer to this, but just wanted to confirm the transaction that was just announced for the Pioneer acreage. I assume that includes acreage tied to your assets and I assume the contracts will just move and there will be no really change from your perspective. Just wanted to confirm that.
Pat McDonie: Yeah, that is correct. The Continental acquisition of Pioneer acreage, a lot of it is dedicated to us and it will just move over with the existing dedication.
Michael Blum: Great. Perfect, thanks. And then I know it’s early, but I wanted to kind of get your read on the EPA’s proposal to regulate methane emissions. Do you see this as a potential costs for your business or is it potentially a positive upside, for example, producers are no longer permitted to flare any natural gas? Just want to get your thoughts there. Thanks.
Matt Meloy: Sure. Yes, with the proposed additional regulations from the EPA, I’d say, as we look through those, we’re in overall agreement with what they’re trying to do, and that’s trying to keep methane in the facilities, which makes sense. We’re already operating with best practices in a lot of these areas. So the recommendations they are putting forth we’re already doing in a lot of the areas, and we’ve been retrofitting and making changes for years doing this. So this may perhaps speed that along some work that we’re already doing. We’re already looking and trying to find leaks along our pipelines and facilities. As outlined in our ESG report, we’re hiring third-parties to fly, kind of going above and beyond and flying our facilities looking for leaks and fixing them. So overall, this is things we’ve already done. It puts some more parameters in place, which we’ll have to follow. But I don’t see that as being an issue for us, it’s things we were already doing. And then an opportunity, I’d say, as we provide really good service to our customers and can have good metrics there, yes, I think there is some potential opportunity as we kind of become leading in this and continue to perform very well. That could be beneficial for some of the larger E&Ps who are focused on our overall performance there.
Michael Blum: Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Keith Stanley: Thanks. Good morning. So appreciating there’s rounding involved in your disclosures, but I was looking at the year-end leverage expectation of 3.25 versus 3.50 last time. If I kind of look at debt outstanding, that implies a pretty big increase in EBITDA for the year, it would be like $2.1 billion for 2021. Is that a possibility based on the math or am I over thinking that and it’s just rounding involved?
Jen Kneale: I mean, clearly, we’re not giving specific numbers on exactly what our expectation is right now for full year adjusted EBITDA. I think we do have a pretty good outlook for the fourth quarter. And now that we’re a month into the fourth quarter, feel good about it. But ultimately, we’ll have to see how the next couple of months shake out and how we finish up the year. But yes, I mean, prices are strong, fundamentals are strong. We do expect increasing volumes really across the business this quarter so to the extent that those materialize. I think it should end up being a pretty good quarter for Targa and that will drive a very nice 2021 overall adjusted EBITDA year for the company.
Keith Stanley: Great, thanks. And second question. The Midland plants just in Q3, I mean, they look like they are already running above nameplate even with Heim. Should we assume you’re somewhat limited on Midland growth until Legacy starts up or can you still kind of flex those facilities higher and meet, I guess, demand?
Pat McDonie: Yes. We have the ability to get some incremental capacity out of the plate above – out our plants above nameplate. When you think about the size of our Midland system and then number of plants that we have, and let’s just say, we’ve got 10% at least capability above nameplate, it’s a pretty substantial amount of incremental capacity that allows us to go ahead and continue to handle all of our producers’ volumes, while we’re building that next plant and putting that incremental capacity in place. Does that answer your question?
Keith Stanley: So 10% above nameplate you think you can get to if needed?
Pat McDonie: I think that’s very comfortable, I’ll put it that way, and some of our facilities have capabilities beyond that 10%.
Keith Stanley: Okay, great. That does answer it. Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Chase Mulvehill from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Chase Mulvehill: Hey, thanks, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess, one quick follow-up to Keith’s question. If you were to run out of capacity in Midland before kind of Legacy comes on, and I know you said you could squeeze more out above nameplate, is it possible for you to move any kind of wet gas over to the Delaware and process the gas there?
Pat McDonie: Yes. We do have some capability of moving gas from the Midland site to the Delaware site. And frankly, looking at ways to improve our capability of doing so. So some looking to grow that. And certainly, we have the ability to offload to peers in the marketplace that having incremental available capacity. So we feel pretty good about our ability to handle the growth in volumes before our next plant comes up just based on the fleet of plants that we currently have. But we certainly have some other flexibility.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay, great. Unrelated follow-up. I know we’ve kind of talked about this a lot on the call so far about capital allocation, but it sounds like excess free cash is going to go to the DevCo buy-in and retiring some of the preferreds, and at some point, you’re going to look at buybacks. So can I ask a question on buybacks? Like, how are you approaching buybacks? Is it kind of more of a planned and measured program each quarter or will it be more opportunistic and price sensitive?
Jen Kneale: We’ve characterized it as opportunistic, Chase. So it’s really going to depend on what’s happening in a given quarter and what’s our outlook for the year, what’s our outlook beyond that. And so we’ll look under – we’ll look at that decision under a number of different frameworks. But I think hopefully what you’re hearing from us is that with the balance sheet flexibility we now feel that we have, it certainly can be part of how we’re going to return capital to shareholders. But we’re not going to provide clarity under the frameworks under which we will or will not participate in the market.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. And noticeably absent was any mention of a special or potential special dividend. Is that off the table?
Jen Kneale: I think from our perspective, everything always has to be on the table. We’ve clearly articulated that as we think about our priorities for 2021. It was managing our leverage lower. And then for 2022, it’s really continuing corporate simplification with the DevCo and the preferred, while also being able to return more capital to shareholders, which I think initially we’re talking about in terms of paying a higher base common dividend and then also potentially being able to engage in some opportunistic repurchases. But everything is always on the table, and that’s what we work through with our Board each and every quarter to make decisions. From our perspective, that’s not something that makes sense for us today, but that doesn’t mean that that couldn’t change in the future.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay, perfect. I’ll turn it back over. Thanks, Jen.
Jen Kneale: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Sunil Sibal from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.
Sunil Sibal: Yes, hi. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for all the color. So my first question is related to the M&A. So obviously, we continue to see fair bit of M&A in the upstream space and some has also started in the midstream side also not too far away from your footprint. So my question was, now that you’ve kind of got the company to where you want it to be over the longer term, how do you look at M&A in the midstream space going forward?
Matt Meloy: Yeah, sure. Good morning. I think for us, it’s really been – it’s really going to be more of the same. I think we’re going to continue to have a high hurdle for us. We have a really good organic growth projects outlook to continue to grow that. So we’re not in a position of need where we feel like we have to go get something to complete our integrated story or that we are really falling short in any area. So we’ll continue to look at assets. We have looked over the last several years. If there is something that’s complementary to our existing assets and it fits well on the G&P side and it has liquid synergies, so it’s a good G&P business with some liquids, we will look at that as we’ve continued to look at it, but we also want to make sure if we do anything there, we’re staying within our 3x to 4x target leverage. So it’s kind of got to be just right for us. So we haven’t really found anything that’s fit that, but we’ll continue to look. But it continues to be a high bar because we have – we think we’re going to able to grow our EBITDA just through organic growth.
Sunil Sibal: Got it. Thanks for that. And my second question related to the ESG initiatives. So obviously, you’ve signed up for solar power through PPAs. I was just curious, should we kind of think about that as the line you intend to take as you look at your ESG initiatives or there could be more kind of meaningful participation there?
Matt Meloy: Yeah. So we have talked quite a bit about the opportunities in terms of investments and how we’re thinking about purchasing power. So I’m excited to be able to announce supporting that power project. Robert Muraro has been working with the team to try to evaluate other opportunities whether it would be additional renewables or carbon capture. Bobby, you just want to talk a little bit about some opportunities?
Bobby Muraro: Yes. I think the way we think about it, this is Bobby, as we look at all these projects that either fit our capital profile or third-party capital profile. So to the extent we can go to low carbon projects that supply power to our assets or carbon capture or something else that we’re willing to fund on our balance sheet or someone else is willing to fund on their balance sheet, we will look to do those projects. I think this is the first example of one where there were someone that was willing to build a solar project that fit within the parameters we want to do from a low carbon standpoint and their return parameters. It probably didn’t hit our return parameters, which is why you won’t see us put money in the projects like that. But to the extent we start to fund ones that do, that will be part of the evaluation going forward. I wouldn’t set a standard to what we would or wouldn’t do, but that’s kind of how the analysis goes internally.
Sunil Sibal: Got it. Thanks for all the color, and congratulations on the good update.
Jen Kneale: Thanks, Sunil.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Bobby Muraro: Thanks, Sunil.

And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt. 
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning everyone. We're excited to announce another great quarter at Targa, as our overall business continued to perform well, led by our position in the Permian Basin and our integrated NGL business. As we continue to execute on our key strategic priorities, we are very pleased with our positioning. Taking into consideration, our first half performance and the strength in our business outlook for the second half of this year coupled with stronger commodity price fundamentals, we are increasing our estimated 2021 EBITDA to be between $1.9 billion and $2 billion. 2021 EBITDA is now estimated to be 19% higher than last year based on the midpoint of our new guidance range. Our prioritization of free cash flow for debt reductions mean we reduced our debt balance by $780 million in the first half of the year and our consolidated leverage was 3.8 times at the end of the second quarter, within our target range of three to four times, and well ahead of schedule due to our strong performance. This provides us greater flexibility and bolsters Targa's financial position. We now expect to end the year at about 3.5 times leverage with a strong balance sheet and well positioned to repurchase the DevCo interest in the first quarter of next year. We're also very proud of the efforts of our Targa employees over a difficult last year and a half. Our employees have continued to perform exceptionally well for our customers, and have done so with a continued focus on safety, and we are very thankful for their efforts. Let's now turn to our operational performance and business outlook. Starting in the Permian, second quarter system volumes rebounded quickly following the major winter storm, during the first quarter, as system inlet volumes increased 15% sequentially. We now expect our 2021 Permian inlet volumes to increase to the high end of the previously disclosed 5% to 10% growth over 2020. Our Permian Midland system ran above nameplate capacity for much of the second quarter, and we're pleased to announce our new 200 million cubic feet per day Heim Plant is mechanically complete and expected to begin full operations in early September. A special thanks to our operations and engineering teams for safely bringing online Heim, well over a month ahead of schedule and under -. We expect Heim to commence operations highly utilized. And given our outlook for continued production growth we announced this morning our plans to move forward with the construction of our new 250 million cubic feet per day Legacy Plant, which is expected to begin operations during the fourth quarter of 2022. Even with the addition of Legacy there is no change to our 2021 net growth capital spending estimate of between $350 million to $450 million. Our current year spend on Legacy is estimated to be about $70 million. In Permian Delaware, completions and activity levels have continued to ramp and we currently have adequate processing capacity to accommodate our anticipated near to medium-term growth. The stronger outlook across our Permian Basin footprint coupled with our new plant announcement will continue to drive incremental volumes through our downstream businesses. Moving on to the Badlands, we saw sequential increases to our gas and crude volumes during the second quarter. Producers are completing wells and we continue to have positive producer dialogue. Turning to our Central region, gas inlet volumes during the second quarter also rebounded from the winter storm and increased 8% sequentially. While the system continues to largely be in decline we are currently seeing a modest uptick in completions and activity, which could mitigate some of the decline. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment, overall system volumes during the second quarter meaningfully rebounded from the effects of prior quarter's major winter storms. Our Grand Prix pipeline continues to perform very well with total deliveries in the Mont Belvieu increasing 14% sequentially. During the second quarter, we transported a record 392,000 barrels per day and we expect volumes to ramp through the balance of the year. We also achieved record fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex, averaging about 644,000 barrels per day during the second quarter, representing an 18% sequential increase. In our LPG export services business at Galena Park, second quarter volumes sequentially increased 20%, averaging 10.3 million barrels per month. While we remain highly contracted, the current higher NGL prices are causing reduced short-term demand for spot opportunities. However, overall the long-term fundamentals remain strong for LPG exports and the current strength in propane prices is still a net positive for Targa. Looking ahead, with our leverage already in the target range and on track to be even lower by year-end, we expect to be in a position to return incremental capital to our shareholders in 2022 after repurchasing the DevCo joint venture interest. We have the ability to return capital to shareholders in a number of different ways, through additional dividend, share repurchases, repayment of preferred equity, and/or continuing to reduce debt. We are currently evaluating along with our Board the best way to deliver value to shareholders while maintaining our long-term financial flexibility. We will prioritize a strong balance sheet that keeps Targa and strong financial position across downside scenarios. We expect to articulate more details in February with our 2022 outlook and capital plan for the year. Targa continues to benefit from the strength of our business and our talented employees and we remain very well positioned for the long-term. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jen.
Jen Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Targa's adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $460 million as second quarter volumes across our integrated Permian Gathering and Processing and Logistics and Transportation systems, meaningfully rebounded from the effects of the winter storm experienced during the first quarter. Second quarter EBITDA was sequentially lower predominantly due to the storm-related benefits and seasonal opportunities in our marketing businesses realized during the first quarter and from higher OpEx from additional volumes moving through our systems and higher G&A. Through the first half of 2020 -- sorry, through the first half of 2021, Targa has generated free cash flow of $593 million versus $171 million over the same time period in 2020, and significantly hedged for 2021 and continue to add hedges for this year and beyond while still benefiting from higher prices across our unhedged equity volume exposure and prices above fee floors. You can find our usual hedge disclosures in our quarterly earnings supplement presentation. As Matt mentioned, we are increasing our full year estimated 2021 adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.9 billion to $2 billion. Our updated financial estimates assume full year 2021 WTI crude oil, prices average $65 per barrel, NGL prices average $0.70 per gallon and Henry Hub and Waha natural gas prices average $3.20 and $3.10 per MMBtu. The biggest drivers of our continued performance relative to previous expectations for 2021 are commodity prices, particularly as we benefit from prices above these floors, also higher volumes and continued cost management relative to expectations. Inclusive of expected spending this year for the newly announced Legacy Plant our 2021 net growth CapEx estimate remains unchanged at between $350 million and $450 million and we now estimate net maintenance CapEx to be lower at approximately $120 million. Our continued strong performance means we expect to end 2021 with consolidated leverage around 3.5x. This puts us in excellent position to repurchase our DevCo interest in the first quarter of 2022 while still maintaining consolidated leverage within our target of three to 4x. Looking forward we believe that existing in the lower half of our target consolidated leverage ratio range provides for more flexibility which is why we are continuing to prioritize free cash flow for debt reduction particularly in advance of our DevCo repurchase. As we look forward our balance sheet is well positioned. We have an excellent liquidity position with no near-term debt maturities. Also in early June Fitch issued their inaugural ratings for Targa and assigned us with a BB+ rating. We really appreciate the amount of work that the Fitch team invested to provide that initial rating. We are now rated by the three leading agencies and are continuing our dialogue with each related to our trajectory towards investment grade which remains a priority for Targa. Shifting to our focus around sustainability and ESG we continue to advance our efforts and internal initiatives in this area and we plan to publish our next sustainability report in the fall. In closing on behalf of all management we say thank you to our talented Targa team for all that they do. And with that I will turn the call back over to Sanjay. 
Sanjay Lad: Thanks Jen. [Operator Instructions] Victor will you please open the lines for Q&A? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni from UBS. You may begin.
Shneur Gershuni: Hi good morning everyone. Maybe to start off a little bit just wanted to chat about your guidance. Obviously it was taken up today and you sort of cited the fact that you expect to be at the higher end of the volume -- or volume growth range. Just kind of curious there's been a lot of discussion around increased activity specifically in the Delaware. Curious if that's around your assets and that's what's driving the guidance increase? Or is there a potential that if this activity in the Delaware continues to increase that we could actually see an even higher exit rate for Targa, when you close out the year? Just kind of curious what was baked in. 
Matt Meloy: Sure. Good morning Shneur. Yes. We are seeing stronger volumes. We pointed at the high end of our range. I'd say it's -- in both the Midland and the Delaware we are seeing I'd say higher activity. But it's really the dynamic we talked about last call, I'd say is still for the most part there which is the larger producers are really staying within what they told us. But the smaller and some of the private guys we are seeing ramp up more. We've seen a steady increase in the rig count but not a huge spike up. So I think we're just seeing just continued strong activity across the board for our producers. Pat is there anything else you'd want to add to that or? 
Pat McDonie: I'd just say that we're seeing activity in both basins. Obviously the Legacy Plant announcement. We're seeing continued strong growth on the Midland side of the basin. We have seen more activity in the Delaware Basin but delineated just as Matt described. The big guys staying kind of on the programs and more little guy activity. So both sides are growing. 
Shneur Gershuni: Cool. Definitely appreciate the color there. And then maybe to follow up in terms of the whole simplification approach. Meaning you've been pretty consistent in saying that this is really a '22 event. I think in your prepared remarks today you talked about DevCo probably happening in 1Q. I imagine you have to give notice and you'll let us know that ahead of time. And if I remember correctly your pref steps down in March as well too which is another component to that. But at the same time, you're kind of in this interesting position today where you can actually write that you're going to be 3.5x leverage by the end of this year. Does that increase your flexibility to be a little bit more opportunistic around buybacks? Or right now everything is parked to take out the DevCo and maybe work on the pref later in next year? 
Matt Meloy: Yes. I'll start, Jen and then if you want to add in. We did say we are targeting 3.5 through year end. And that does assume that we're prioritizing our free cash flow to go towards debt reduction. That is our base case plan is to get there and that just puts us in a good position to be able to take out the DevCo in the first part of next year. We do have a share buyback authorized. But what you've seen us do this year for the first part is prioritize that free cash flow towards debt reduction. That's my expectation that we'll continue to do that. We're still having the ability to do share repurchases. And then we're taking a hard look at that with our Board and we'll kind of lay out what the 2022 capital plan is in February for our free cash flow. 
Jen Kneale: All, I'll add Shneur is that I think the flexibility of our outperformance -- the flexibility as a result of our outperformance this year positions us really nicely to be able to take out to DevCos in the first quarter and still have our leverage within that long-term target range which is great. And then as we think about the pref we've got a lot of optionality there. It steps down to 105% in mid-March, but that's something that we also could look at taking out ratably over a number of quarters in order to maintain that balance sheet flexibility that we've worked so hard to get. 
Shneur Gershuni: Great. So it sounds like a lot of flexibility here and the outperformance in guidance increase -- sort of positions you to have a lot of options. Is that kind of the takeaway guide? 
Jen Kneale: That's right. 
Mat Meloy: Yes, that's right. 
Shneur Gershuni: Perfect. Thank you very much. Really appreciate the color, today.
Mat Meloy: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of John Mackay from Goldman Sachs. You may begin.
John Mackay: Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the time. Maybe for a first one I'll just circle back on Shneur's first question on Permian volumes. So I'm thinking if we look at where you guys sit right now you're kind of at the top end of the range or close for the growth guidance even if you're kind of flat for the next couple of quarters. Just curious to balance that against your comments of activity overall picking up. And whether or not that's just some conservatism or you see anything else going on? 
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure. We typically see especially on the Midland side a lot of growth as we get into second quarter and into the third quarter. So some of it is seasonal. We see a lot of activity. We see that continuing. And sometimes it feels like the activity is more ratable, but the volumes tend to grow more in the second and third quarter. And we are seeing that this year I think which is part of that. So while we do expect some growth as we kind of continue through the back half of the year and into 2022 it may not be at the same rate that we kind of experienced in the last few months. Pat anything? 
Pat McDonie: No, I agree. We're lumpy in that second third quarter but we do expect growth through the end of the year probably not as lumpy as what we've seen over the last six months. 
John Mackay: Okay. That's fair. Thank you. And then just on CapEx. The first half was lower than we expected. Looks like the Heim Plant is coming in sooner than expected. You guys reduced the maintenance guidance, but not the growth guidance. I'm just curious on kind of what else is kind of filling out that second half of the year spending. And is that because of more activity we're seeing more well connects and that can kind of give us a read on 2022? Or anything else going on in there? 
Jen Kneale: I think the biggest piece John is the announcement of the Legacy Plant. So as Matt mentioned in his scripted remarks that moves essentially $70 million of spending into this year that we otherwise -- we're probably likely going to spend this year. And so when you think about where we are year-to-date we've spent call it around $150 million and then we now have that additional $70 million. So the remainder of our expected spending is for additional gathering and lines and compression to support the continued growth of our gathering and processing footprint and then some small downstream projects that are consistent with what we've been forecasting previously. 
John Mackay: Okay. Thanks. I guess just to clarify that. So the Legacy Plant -- that is still the same one you guys were, I guess, evaluating last quarter and now it's just kind of formally in the  budget. Is that the right way to think about it? 
Matt Meloy: Sure.
Jen Kneale: That's right. It's formally Board-approved now and the spending has begun on it.
John Mackay: Okay. All right. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.
Matt Meloy: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. You may begin.
Michael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to just clarify just looking at sequentially that the marketing margins were down. Is that just due to the absence of every [ph] opportunities, or is there something else going on with NGL marketing that -- I just want to make sure I understood that.
Jen Kneale: It's really two pieces Michael. And we talked a little bit about this on our first quarter earnings call that was in the first quarter. On the marketing side, we benefited from both the winter storm and then there were also some benefits from contango opportunities that we entered into in the sort of early in the second quarter and late in the first quarter of 2020.
Michael Blum: Got it. And then I wanted to ask about LPG exports. You mentioned perhaps some fewer spot opportunities. But in light of just how high propane prices are, do you think in the second half of the year, you're going to see actual cargo cancellations? It just seems like something's got to give. 
Scott Pryor: Yeah, Michael, this is Scott. I would first point to the fact that our export performance was strong in the second quarter, a nice recovery from what we saw in the first quarter, which was impacted by the February winter storm. Certainly as you pointed to of late and really throughout this year the increased price on both propane and butane here in the US versus global pricing has impacted some opportunities for spot. So I think when you look at it the international market is choosing at times to look at other places as opposed to US Gulf Coast for exports. And at times quite frankly, Targa may choose to not participate at certain pricing levels. So as a result of that, I think spot opportunities may be impacted. As Matt pointed out though higher prices here on propane in the US help us in other areas of our integrated platform, so we benefit from that. We have not experienced any cancellations to this point. But again the fundamentals with inventories here in the US about 20 million barrels behind this time last year that supports propane prices, which could have an impact on spot opportunities. We're well contracted. And should we see cancellations, obviously, we collect the cancellation fee as a result of that.
Michael Blum: Understood. Thank you.
Scott Pryor: Okay. Thanks Michael.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. You may begin.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Matt Meloy: Jeremy, good morning.
Jeremy Tonet: Just wanted to start off on the credit side here and we get to similar numbers. You guys being around 3.5 times levered at the end of the year, delevering rapidly into next year, two billion being a quite notable size and scale. I'm just curious why the agencies I guess haven't been moving a bit quicker towards IAG here. I mean, it seems like you check all the boxes those metrics that leverage is actually better than all the other C-corp peers. So am I missing something here, or is there something else for the agencies? 
Jen Kneale: I think with respect to -- we're in a consistent dialogue with the agencies and we certainly I think share your view Jeremy. I think part of what they're looking for is just continued sustainable performance and delivering on what we said we were going to do related to our deleveraging, related to our continued discipline around CapEx spending and the like. So I believe that we already have incredibly strong metrics. And I'm really proud of the organization for getting us in the position that we're in where we could end this year with leverage around 3.5 times. Certainly agree with you and I hope that the rating agencies similarly will continue to assess our strong performance thus far this year and really over the last 18 months and will start to take positive credit actions. All we can do is continue to stay in front of them. And I think that we have an excellent dialogue with all three agencies and appreciate the amount of time that they've been willing to spend with us over the last 18 months too. So I do feel like it's just a matter of time.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Yeah. I just wanted to make sure they knew you had the lowest leverage of all C-corp peers because that kind of stood out to us. But maybe moving on here to carbon capture. It seems from the maps that we can tell. Some of your processing plants in the Permian are, kind of, a stones throw away from some CO2 plants. So I'm just, kind of, wondering is that something you see in the near future? If there's all this, kind of, ESG green PE money out there. Is there any reason not to invite them into a JV where they put up the capital, you guys put in the assets and get something going together there that's positive ESG doesn't cost a lot for Targa?
Matt Meloy: Yeah Jeremy, we are [Technical Difficulty]. So we're looking at carbon capture up our processing plants and evaluating what that project could look like. We are -- as we go through it, I agree with you. I don't know that there's going to be a shortage of capital is going to be the issue, just kind of getting through some of the operational where we're going to sequester it, and permitting and some other things that we're working hard on. So -- and you also said in the near-term, I think this is also -- it is going to take a while right, for us to figure if we have a viable project here or not? I'd say we're making good progress. As we kind of learn more, I'm becoming increasingly optimistic that there's a potential to do something here but it's still going to take -- it's going to take sometime.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. So hopefully if the Railroad Commission gets primacy there that things can kind of move a bit quicker but great to hear things are going in that direction. So I'll leave it there. Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thanks Jeremy.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Tristan Richardson from Truist Securities. You may begin.
Tristan Richardson: Hey good morning guys. I appreciate all the comments. Just a follow-up to an earlier question on capital in 2022, obviously you guys make very clear priorities in 2022 around leverage and DevCo consolidation and cost of capital management. But just thinking, if we've got a very short list of identified projects and really only half of the Legacy Plant spend in 2022, even on the back of increased completion activity should we think capital could come in further next year than even kind of where you've talked about where the guidance is today for 2021?
Jen Kneale: Tristan, this is Jen. I think ultimately it will depend on activity levels. We're certainly continuing to see good growth around our systems particularly on both, the Midland side and also the Delaware side in the Permian. So we certainly expect continued spending on gathering lines compression et cetera. Plus we'll have the remaining spending of the Legacy Plant and then we'll be, having to likely think about the right timing for the next plant in the Midland Basin just depending on how forecast flows. So I think right now we're not in a position to give 2022 CapEx, but I think that my expectation was the -- would be that it would be more similar to this year versus we'd see a material drop-off year-over-year.
Tristan Richardson: That's helpful. And then, just secondly, just curious thoughts on sort of hedging philosophy in 2022, I mean I think this time a year ago the world was very different and you guys were very intentional on taking out equity links just taking it out of the question for 2021. But just thinking in somewhat more normal world thoughts on equity links particularly against the past several years of VL's big shift to a much more fee-based model?
Matt Meloy: Yeah. As far as our hedging goes I mean, we are going to want to stay -- we call it programmatic hedging, our target is 75% year one, 50% year two and then 25% year three. I see us continuing to execute kind of along that programmatic amount and be somewhere around those ranges. But you're right with our leverage lower and with more fee-based we would have some opportunity to even go inside of that. But I think right now, where we are is kind of sticking with that 75% 50% 25% is approach that's worked for us and something we're likely to kind of hover around for a while.
Tristan Richardson: Great. Matt, thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Spiro Dounis from Crédit Suisse. You may begin.
Spiro Dounis: Hi good morning team. Two quick follow-ups from me first one on capital return and kind of tying it back to Jeremy's question around investment grade. It sounds like you guys are on a path there. It's all about execution. Just curious in your discussions with the agencies have they provided any sort of guardrails for you as you sort of formulate that plan to return capital? And then, also kind of imagine you've been getting feedback from investors as you go through this process. So curious what so far has kind of resonated with you as you formulate that plan?
Jen Kneale: I think clearly our existing investors potential investors and then the rating agencies are some of the important constituents where we have to take their points of view into consideration as we work with the Board through this fall really to then be in a position to articulate what our go-forward strategy on capital allocation will be. That again as Matt said, we expect to articulate in February Spiro. So I'd say that, it's an evolving dialogue. I'd say that, we're getting a lot of advice. And I'd say that that advice is varied as one would expect just depending on what type of investor we're talking to or certainly the rating agencies want to see more credit positive decision-making versus the alternative. So those are all very important voices and we are certainly listening to them and then providing our Board with that feedback. And that's an important part of the evolving conversation at Targa.
Spiro Dounis: Great. Thanks a lot, Jen. Second question just on asset sales. Obviously, not in a position where you need to do anything but I know at one point you had contemplated selling some non-core assets last year. It seems like the M&A market has dramatically improved, valuations seem to be coming back assets are changing hands. Just curious where that stands and if there's any interest there?
Jen Kneale: I think you'll continue to see us be opportunistic Spiro. So to the extent that we think there's an asset or assets that make sense for somebody else to own, if they have a lower cost of capital for other reasons and that's something that we'll consider. But as you said in your opening part of the question, the great part of this is we've got a lot of flexibility and we don't need to do anything. So that means that the bar and the threshold for us willing to sell assets is higher than it certainly was before when we needed to sell assets in order to be able to finance our growth capital.
Spiro Dounis: Got it. That’s all I had. Thanks for the time, Jen.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. 
Keith Stanley: Hi, good morning. I wanted to clarify one thing on return of capital for next year. You listed options of buybacks, dividends and buying in the preferred equity. So I guess how do you compare buying in the prefs versus the other alternatives? And you talked a little bit about maybe buying it in gradually. Is it fair to say you have a more patient tone on the pace of taking out the prefs than perhaps in past quarters? 
Jen Kneale: I think from our perspective the TRC pref is a material amount of capital that we need to deploy in order to be able to redeem that. So as we look at it, it is higher cost to us at 9.5%, but we also have a lot of flexibility in terms the amount of time that we have that we want to redeem it. So I think you are hearing from us that our base case assumption right now is that there really isn't a driving reason to have to take it out in the first quarter in mid-March, when it steps down to 105%. We can maintain and even enhance our balance sheet flexibility by being a little bit more deliberate with the TRC prefs and taking it out more slowly over time. And so that's the base case assumption that we're running Keith. Of course that can evolve as we move through this year and into next year as we have more flexibility with the increasing free cash flow but that's the current assumption that we're running.
Keith Stanley: Got it. Thanks. And second question you've talked about increased activity in the Permian. And I feel like we've heard some mixed things this earnings season on that. And the one thing I'm wondering just last year you had associated gas production meaningfully outpace oil. Are you seeing any changes in that dynamic? Or do you think gas NGL production growth from here continues to outpace the oil production growth in the Permian? 
Pat McDonie: No. We see it continuing. As you described it's exactly right. And obviously, the Delaware is a little more oily than the Midland side of the basin, dependent upon where our overall volume growth could affect it a little bit but absolutely more gassy.
Keith Stanley: Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Mosca from Mizuho. You may begin.
Robert Mosca: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. One whom was already asked. But just curious one of your G&P peers in the Bakken seems to be benefiting from rising gas oil ratios and -- assets there and in the Permian. We're just curious to hear whether longer term you expect to see a similar sort of GOR trajectory in the Permian as that base matures? Or whether Permian is a bit of a different animal in terms of underlying geology? Just curious to hear your thoughts. 
Matt Meloy: Yes. I mean I think we are benefiting similarly to others as you see higher GOR go up. You have seen that help us out in the Permian and you've seen our gas performance be even a little bit better than our crude here, when you look at this quarter. So I think the higher GOR is a tailwind for us across multiple systems. 
Robert Mosca: Okay. thanks. That’s all from me.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Sunil Sibal from Seaport Global. You may begin.
Sunil Sibal: Yes. Hi. Good morning everybody. Couple of questions from me. There has been a fair bit of industry discussion on ethane recovery. I was just curious, if you could talk about some trends that you're seeing on your systems. And also kind of remind us with regard to your commercial contract with the customers, is those decisions on ethane recovery made at the Targa level or is it primarily at the customers? Especially, considering that it seems like you do have some frac capacity and also ability to expand Grand Prix. 
Matt Meloy: Sure. Yes. On ethane recovery I'd say it varies across our systems for whether producers have elections or we make the election. So it varies by contract by system. But for the most part our assets are in recovery and kind of have been in recovery. So that's how most of our assets are operating. You did see if you look -- you saw an uptick in South Texas where it was in rejection. Now it's in recovery. So you saw an NGL uplift there. But for the most part the other systems were really already in recovery. 
Sunil Sibal: Okay. Then second question, was related to the margins in the logistics segment. So clearly there was a rapid downtick there. I was just curious, on the transportation and services side are you seeing any kind of movements in the rates? Or those -- that part of the business is fairly steady and most of the dynamics or the changes are on the marketing side of things? 
Matt Meloy: Yes. So most of our volumes that are going downstream business whether it's transportation or fractionation are under long-term contract. So there's not a whole lot of movement in terms of rates there for, where the volumes that are going through our assets. I think when you look at the unit margin you just look at the reported numbers what Jen talked about was we had some marketing gains in the first quarter. So we had some outperformance due to the winter storm and some marketing gains, which kind of skewed the unit margins higher. But overall just run rate business is performing well and are generally under long-term contract. 
Sunil Sibal: Okay. Got it. Thank you 
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And I'm not showing any further questions in the queue at this moment.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-06 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. And welcome to Targa Resources First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After this presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Sanjay Lad, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. 
Sanjay Lad: Thanks, Carmen. Good morning and welcome to the first quarter 2021 earnings call for Targa Resources Corp. The first quarter earnings release along with the first quarter earnings supplement presentation for Targa Resources that accompany our call are available on our website at targaresources.com in the Investors section. In addition, an updated presentation has also been posted to our website. Statements made during this call that might include Targa Resources' expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings. Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer; and Jen Kneale, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, the following senior management team members will be available for Q&A, Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.
Matthew Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning. During the quarter, our overall business continued to perform very well, led by our position in the Permian Basin and our integrated NGL business and positive aggregate benefits from the winter storm. We continued to execute on our key strategic priorities, including prioritizing free cash flow towards debt reduction as we reduced our debt balance by $383 million quarter-over-quarter. The severe weather from the February winter storm impacted us across our operations during the first quarter. Over a 10-day period around the storm, we experienced, on average, a 50% reduction across our gathering and processing and downstream system volumes. Our overall system volumes quickly rebounded and returned to around pre-storm levels later in the first quarter. Those operational impacts were offset by storm-related benefits elsewhere in our business, which resulted in an aggregate margin benefit of about $30 million for the quarter. Let's now turn to our operational performance and business outlook. Starting in the Permian, we remain on track and expect our average total 2021 Permian inlet volumes to increase between 5% and 10% over last year. We are seeing increasing activity levels across both our Midland and Delaware footprints with our current Permian inlet gas volumes ahead of pre-storm levels averaging about 2.7 billion cubic feet per day. With our Permian Midland system running close to capacity, our new 200 million cubic feet per day Heim Plant will be much needed and remains on track to begin operations early in the fourth quarter. We continue to evaluate the timing of our next Midland plant, which we estimate would cost about $150 million and could be needed as early as the second half of 2022. We currently have adequate processing capacity in Permian Delaware to accommodate our anticipated near- to medium-term growth. Moving on to the Badlands. Our gas and crude volumes during the first quarter each sequentially decreased 6% largely due to the winter conditions in North Dakota. We are seeing completions increase across our system and are having increasing producer dialogue around a ramp in activity levels. Turning to our Central Region, which continues to largely be in decline, gas inlet volumes in the first quarter were further impacted by the effects of the winter storm. We are currently seeing a modest uptick in completions and activity levels, which could mitigate some of the decline. Across our Gathering and Processing business, our margins are also benefiting from the inherent tailwinds associated with higher commodity prices and the upside participation embedded in our fee floor arrangements as a result of our recontracting efforts. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment, our Grand Prix pipeline continues to perform very well. Current Grand Prix deliveries into Mont Belvieu are approximately 380,000 barrels per day, and we expect volumes to continue to ramp from here. We continue to estimate full year 2021 average deliveries into Mont Belvieu to increase over 25% from 2020 average throughput. Our fractionation volumes in Mont Belvieu rebounded from the winter storm, and we are once again seeing higher volumes of around 630,000 barrels per day. In addition to the winter storm impact, lower sequential frac volumes were also attributable to some minor repairs. And recall that fourth quarter 2020 frac volumes benefited from working down inventory as a result of scheduled maintenance performed in the second half of 2020. In our LPG export services business at Galena Park, first quarter volumes averaged 8.5 million barrels per month and were down 23% sequentially. Fourth quarter 2020 volumes benefited from the very strong export fundamentals, which enabled us to capture some shorter term volumes during the prior quarter. The impact from the winter storm, combined with periods of fog along the Houston ship channel during the first quarter, also contributed to the sequential volume decline. The outlook for full year 2021 and beyond remains strong, and we expect our LPG export volumes to be higher during the second quarter over first quarter levels. Taking into consideration our first quarter results, strong business performance and continued focus around cost management, coupled with a stronger estimated commodity price outlook for the balance of 2021, we are increasing our full year estimated 2021 adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. 2021 adjusted EBITDA is now estimated to be 13% higher than 2020 based on the midpoint of our new guidance range. With our higher full year adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow estimate, we expect to end 2021 with reported leverage around 4 times. As we look forward, our integrated NGL business is poised to continue to benefit from an overall recovery, and we have the ability to capture growth volumes from the Permian without having to spend much incremental CapEx on Grand Prix, fractionation or LPG export facilities. This puts Targa in a position to generate strong returns going forward and increasing free cash flow after dividends available to reduce debt and further strengthen our financial position. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jen.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $516 million, increasing 18% over the fourth quarter. The aggregate net benefit from the winter storm, lower operating in G&A expenses and higher commodity prices drove the sequential increase in adjusted EBITDA. Commodity prices meaningfully increased quarter-over-quarter. And while we are significantly hedged, our Gathering and Processing segment gross margin directly benefits from higher prices across our unhedged equity exposure and to the extent prices are above our fee floors. During the first quarter, Targa generated free cash flow of $336 million, which, as Matt mentioned, was utilized to reduce our aggregate debt balance significantly. And our consolidated reported debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 4.3 times at the end of the first quarter, which was a reduction from 4.7 times at year-end 2020. We did make a reporting change that you may have noticed, beginning in the first quarter of 2021, we now include certain fuel and power costs, previously included in operating expenses, in product purchases and fuel to better reflect the direct relationship of these costs to our revenue-generating activities and align with our evaluation of the performance of the business. Prior periods have been updated to reflect this change. We remain significantly hedged for 2021 and continue to add hedges for this year and beyond. Relative to when we last reported in February, we added incremental hedges across most commodities as we benefited from higher prices, particularly in the prompt year. You can find our usual hedge disclosures in our quarterly earnings supplement presentation. As Matt mentioned, we are increasing our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA estimate to be between $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Our updated financial estimates assume full year 2021 WTI crude oil prices to average $60 per barrel, NGL prices to average $0.60 per gallon and Henry Hub and Waha natural gas prices to average $2.75 and $2.65 per MMbtu. Given the strength of first quarter adjusted EBITDA and the seasonality of some of our businesses, we expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA to be lower than ramping through the back half of the year, providing significant momentum heading into 2022 as we expect to end 2021 with reported leverage of around four times. Also, we would expect aggregate OpEx and G&A to be higher in the second quarter as some costs shifted from the first quarter related to the winter storm. In Q2, aggregate OpEx G&A is estimated to more closely approximate the fourth quarter. We continue to be very proud of the organization's efforts on reducing costs, and this will continue to be an area of focus across the company. Our 2021 CapEx estimates remain unchanged with net growth CapEx to be between $350 million and $450 million and net maintenance CapEx of approximately $130 million. There is no change to our near-term capital allocation strategy. To continue to improve our leverage ratios and simplify our corporate structure, we are making significant progress on advancing towards our long-term consolidated leverage ratio target of three to four times as we continue to focus on improving our corporate ratings and becoming investment grade. There is no change to our assumption that we will repurchase the DevCo interest in the first quarter of 2022, which would generate additional EBITDA in 2022 and beyond and be about leverage neutral. Shifting to Targa's focus around sustainability and ESG, we continue to advance our efforts and internal initiatives in this area. We recently announced the formation of a Sustainability committee at the Board level, which will report to the Board on a quarterly basis. Targa has also joined the ONE Future Coalition, and we plan to publish our next sustainability report in the fall. Finally, I would like to echo Matt's comments. Targa continues to benefit from the strength of our integrated business, and we remain exceptionally well positioned for the long term. On behalf of management, we would all like to say thank you to all of our Targa team for continuing to prioritize safety and providing best-in-class service to our customers. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks, Jen. We kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up and please re-enter the Q&A line up, if you have additional questions. Carmen, would you please open the lines for Q&A?
Operator: Thank you. And our first question will be Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Matthew Meloy: Hey, good morning, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: I think you touched on this a bit during the prepared remarks, but just wanted to kind of dive in a bit more when it comes to capital allocation philosophy, a few different things that can happen here, be it lowering leverage outright, the press that can be kind of brought in simplifying to bring in the opco, I just wanted to see kind of how you think about these different priorities at this point. And also, I guess if activity levels are starting to tick up, I mean do you see pressure on CapEx moving up to kind of facilitate that? Or do you think it's really these other measures I mentioned first are top priority?
Matthew Meloy: Sure. Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. I'll touch on capital allocation and let Jen kind of fill in some additional comments there. Our overall capital allocation priority is on leverage reduction. You saw us do that in the first quarter. That's going to be our priority to try and make progress towards getting ratings increases, towards investment-grade and getting into our target, three to 4 times. So that is going to be our overriding priority there. And then on your second point in terms of CapEx pressure, with increasing volumes, we are optimistic that Permian volumes are going to continue to grow year-over-year. We do have capacity out in the Permian Delaware. So we really think in terms of CapEx pressure where you're going to see it is on that Permian Midland side. And I mentioned in my remarks, we're evaluating right now the timing of when we may need to add another plant out there. With volume currently running around 2.7 Bcf a day, we're kind of hitting our capacity. So we're going to need the Heim Plant to come on. We do have some ability to stretch beyond nameplate and provide us some cushion for that next plant. But we're evaluating right now that next plant. And that's for the tune of about $150 million, which would be spread out over the bill cycle. So it's manageable. We can still continue to generate free cash flow, deleverage and make progress with all of our goals even in an environment if we see some more strength on volumes. And then, Jen, you want to add anything more on the capital allocation...
Jennifer Kneale: I'd just say, Jeremy, that being ahead of schedule essentially gives us more flexibility. And so from our perspective, that flexibility doesn't change the base plan that we articulated in our scripted remarks and that Matt just reiterated, which is really reducing leverage, improving our ratios and then simplifying both taking out the DevCo and redeeming the TRC preferred. So those will continue to be our areas of focus, which is very consistent with how we've been talking about our capital allocation strategy over the last many quarters.
Jeremy Tonet: That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then maybe kind of shifting gears, you've seen changes recently out of D.C. with the 45Qs kind of more credit happening there, supporting initiatives such as carbon capture. And it seems like where processing plants stand on the cost curve for carbon capture, the 45Qs could possibly make that economic given the purity of the CO2 stream there. Just wondering if you had any thoughts on that side, if that's something you could see Targa doing at some point in the future. Or any other thoughts on energy transition efforts like that you might want to share?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. Sure. Yes. In terms of broader energy transition, we think NGLs, crude gas are going to be here for decades to come, and we're really well positioned within that environment. That said, we will continue to look at other opportunities. We mentioned on our previous calls, we'll evaluate are there some renewable projects that we could either support or help underwrite with commitments to off take some electricity, whether it be solar or wind. We're continuing to evaluate those projects. And then on the carbon capture front, we are taking a look at that. So we have folks internally that are looking at can we aggregate CO2 and either sell the CO2 or sequester it and just put it down hole. So we are evaluating that. I would say that does fit what seems like more of our core competency, gathering CO2, putting it in a pipe and then moving it. So we are looking at that. I'd say we're in the early stages of that. And whether the 45Q credits are enough or not, I'd say right now, it's still too early. We're in the scoping and seeing if something could work out there. But we are evaluating that as that one seems that may have more potential. But for any additional capital that we would spend, whether it's carbon capture or anything else, it would have to generate strong returns relative to our other organic growth opportunities and if -- so there may be some projects that we help support, and we can find other sources of capital if it's not meeting our threshold.
Jeremy Tonet: That’s quite encouraging to hear. Thank you.
Matthew Meloy: Okay. Thank you, Jeremy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your question please?
Shneur Gershuni: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe start off, just kind of wanted to talk about your guidance a little bit here. Jen, definitely appreciate the color around timing for 2Q as to why your guidance is not even higher, and don't take this as I'm complaining, guidance increase is good. Last quarter, you had mentioned that the high end of the range was achievable without any changes in volume expectations. Is that still the case? And within the context of the guidance question, we're just wondering if you can talk about the performance of the fee floors as well, too. And are there any elements of conservatism within your guide?
Jennifer Kneale: Shneur, this is Jen. I don't recall saying that we could meet the high end of our guidance range without changing any of our volume expectations. But I think that the guidance range that we put out today is one that is higher for a variety of factors. We've actualized the first quarter. We did benefit from the storm to the tune of $30 million, which is certainly additive. And then as we look forward over the rest of the year, I think just a continued expectation of strong operating performance. Matt gave some color on where our volumes sort of sit today. And again, I think we just feel better about the base performance of our business as a result of where volumes are and really, the fact that it feels like maybe there's light at the end of the tunnel around COVID. So that's providing I think a little bit of a tailwind as well just in terms of more macro stability and how that relates to Targa. Clearly, to the extent that we continue to benefit from higher commodity prices that will be additive to what we published today. To the extent that we have higher commodity prices that result in more activity levels, then that could obviously increase our expectations for volumes for this year. So there are a lot of factors at play. But I think that it feels like we've got a lot of momentum right now, and that momentum is creating a lot of flexibility, and that's what we're really excited about. And importantly, it's really the base business that's creating a lot of that momentum along with discontinued management of costs related to our base business activities, which, again, the organization has done a really good job of doing. We haven't provided a lot of color around exactly where sort of the fee floors are set and what the upside at different commodity prices means related to our fee floors. But what we have done is consistent with what we published in February, the commodity price sensitivity that we have for our business that we published also in our earnings supplement and broader presentation today, that encompasses our expectations for additional margin from not only just direct commodity price appreciation on unhedged volumes, but also if prices move higher, what that would mean for our fee floors. And then there are a variety of other factors that are also included in there. So I do think that that's a pretty good sensitivity related to performance of aggregate Targa business in higher commodity price environments.
Shneur Gershuni: Perfect. Really appreciate all the color there. Maybe following up on the momentum seen here just sort of thinking about the simplification process as it unfolds, you talked about in your prepared remarks that you have not changed the expectation around the DevCo. Does that mean the - despite the momentum, the [indiscernible] hasn't changed? Or you're just not updating the time line? And maybe as we think about the whole simplification process, your leverage and liquidity are certainly there for the DevCo at this stage right now. Should we be thinking about perhaps as the next simplification step? Or is rightsizing the dividend something on the radar screen? Just any color with respect to your thoughts there would be great.
Jennifer Kneale: We've talked a little bit about the EBITDA expectations from the DevCo buy-in. And so there, you've got Train six and GCX, which are relatively stable cash flows. Those essentially have been full since they came online. So really, the upside asset that's within the DevCos is Grand Prix. And so from our perspective, certainly, Grand Prix is continuing to perform phenomenally well, but it's not changing that base case assumption that we'll take out the DevCos in a single tranche in Q1 of '22, which is an assumption that I think has been well received. It's easy I think for investors and potential investors to understand, and it is consistent with what our base plan is, and that plan hasn't changed. Clearly, the second part of what we characterize as our corporate simplification prioritization is redeeming the TRC preferred, and that steps down to 105% at the end of the first quarter of 2022. And I think if you look at where our balance sheet is expected to be at that point in time, we have a lot of flexibility. And our continued outperformance would just enhance that flexibility. And so I think you're absolutely right that, that is definitely a priority. And that is, again, very consistent with what we've laid out over the last many quarters, which is our simplification isn't really complete until the TRC pref is also redeemed.
Shneur Gershuni: All right. Perfect. And then I guess the upside to the dividend would be further down the road.
Matthew Meloy: Yes. I think once we kind of achieve our target leverage ratio, hit the simplification that Jen talked about, then the best way to return capital, look at our free cash flow and whether it's more organic growth or dividend or share repurchase, that will be evaluated with the Board and then decided about what the right - appropriate way to distribute that is.
Shneur Gershuni: Perfect. Thank you very much, everyone. Really appreciate the color. And have a safe day.
Matthew Meloy: Okay. Thank you
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks, Shneur.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Michael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I had a question on the guidance. As you know, I'm sure propane inventories are somewhat depleted. And do you think we could see domestic demand drive prices higher in the back half of the year as you head towards winter potentially narrow the ARB, which could impact exports. Just curious how you're thinking about that scenario as the year plays out and what exactly is factored into guidance.
Matthew Meloy: Yes. Sure, Michael. Yes. We have seen really strong NGL prices across the board. And you're right. On propane, inventories are low, and we've seen strong pricing there. That could have some impacts for the shorter-term kind of uncontracted volumes as we go through the remainder of the year. We have significant contracts in place. We feel good about our base business. For the remainder of the year on the export side. But if there is some strength in pricing there, we do have upside exposure through our G&P business. So we have some offsets there. So overall, higher NGL prices, generally speaking, are going to benefit Targa. There may be some offset to some shorter-term opportunities in export. But I think, overall, higher propane prices, other NGL prices, is likely going to be a positive for us.
Michael Blum: Great. And then I wonder if you can just talk a little bit about Pioneer's sort of tuck-in acquisition of DoublePoint. At least my understanding is that acreage is already dedicated to you, but just curious if there's any ancillary benefits or incremental upside there from that transaction as it relates to your volumes.
Matthew Meloy: Yes. Sure. I'm going to - we don't like to talk about specific customers and contracts that we have in play. So I'm going to answer that more generally, Michael. I think as some of our larger customers in general are growing, whether it's in the Delaware or Permian Midland side, as they grow, we have good relationships with those larger customers. I think in the short term, it's not going to be -- have any material impact, really positive or negative for us. But over the longer term as the larger guys, the relationships we have with our customers continue to increase, over the longer term, it is a good thing for us. So the consolidation on the upstream side longer-term is a -- we view it as a net positive for us.
Michael Blum: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt Company. Please go ahead.
Colton Bean: Morning. So just looking at the business mix there on Page nine of the presentation, looks like marketing may have been north of $100 million for Q1. So can you just walk us through the marketing results last quarter and then how that reconciles to $30 million of net benefit from weather?
Jennifer Kneale: Colton, this is Jen. We generally are a little bit opaque about the benefits that we get within the marketing business just because there tends to be a lot of moving pieces each quarter and we tend to have marketing benefits each quarter. So I'm not going to really get into the specifics here. But you'll recall in 2020 that we benefited from being able to enter into trades when there was a lot of contango in various commodity markets. And so you're seeing some of that be realized as we really moved through time, going back to earlier in 2020. And in particular, we did benefit in the first quarter from that. And then there were also some storm-related benefits, which, again, we're not going to get into the specifics of, but those were also factored into the outperformance for the marketing business.
Colton Bean: Got it. So some of that - it sounds like a decent portion was already in the works in 2020, it wasn't necessarily related to February?
Jennifer Kneale: Correct.
Colton Bean: Okay. And then maybe just to ask Shneur's question a little bit more pointed. I think on the updated EBITDA guide at the midpoint, it looks like it implies just under $450 million for the remaining three quarters. So if we back out that $30 million from Q1, it's still a little bit lower. So just - is that primarily the OpEx impact that you referenced, Jen, or anything else to point to?
Jennifer Kneale: That's primarily the delta that I think you're looking for, is we do expect that we'll see higher aggregate OpEx and G&A in the second quarter. And then we'll be continuing to try to manage those costs as we move forward through the year, but a little bit dependent on volumes and also just dependent on higher costs. And there are some elements that we need to purchase for our operations where we are seeing some increases in costs. But our guys are doing a really, really good job of managing costs lower everywhere across our businesses. So we'll continue to look for outperformance in that realm as we move through the rest of the year.
Matthew Meloy: And there is some seasonality in our NGL business on the wholesale refinery services side, which generally has a better Q4 and Q1 as there's more sales in the winter. So there is some, all things equal, softness in the second quarter relative to the first quarter because of that. But Jen's right, I'd say it's largely probably more on the OpEx side, but then partially due to some seasonality as well.
Colton Bean: Understood. Appreciate the detail.
Matthew Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Christine Cho: Thank you. I actually have a follow-up to the propane question. Given that inventories are depleted and earlier in the quarter, we saw propane prices at Conway trading at a nice premium, and I suspect that we can see that later again this year, can you remind us if you're able to benefit from higher Conway prices? Would that just be from any supply that you physically have hitting that hub from your Mid-Con operations? Or is there any other way to, I don't know, physically bring up volumes from Mont Belvieu benefit from your pipeline that you now have?
Scott Pryor: Christine, this is Scott. First off, just to reiterate some of the things that Matt was saying, certainly from an inventory perspective, which is leading to what Michael's question was, inventories across the industry stand at about 41 million barrels with the most recent inventory stats. We didn't have much of a build from the last stats, again, just a week on week. That puts us below where we were this time last year. But certainly, that has helped increase the prices, which is -- I think it will take some time before we see some of the pricing across the world -- globe to reflect some of that activity. But increased prices, obviously, is going to help sustain some increased growth on the production side of things. As it relates to Conway, on the margin, we have opportunities to bring products down from Conway, recognizing that we've got the pipe in place, but it is predominantly a Y-grade pipeline, but there are some opportunities on the margin to bring it down. So I think relatively speaking, though, we're going to continue to see increased production from the Permian, and that's going to help us translate into larger volumes of Y-grade coming into our systems. And I think it will help shore up inventories over time. But again, depending upon what we see from an export perspective and just touching base on that for just a little bit, certainly, our volumes were down from the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. But as Matt alluded to in our comments, we certainly see that our second quarter export volumes will be up over our first quarter volumes.
Christine Cho: Okay. And then just going on to CapEx for the new Midland plant, is that going to be new build? Or are you moving around one of your other plants? And can you remind us the lead time on that? So if you want it potentially in second half of next year, when would you have to start spending money?
Matthew Meloy: Sure. Yes. We're evaluating and kind of have evaluated and are continuing to evaluate the best plan to put in for the next plant. Right now, the reason I said the $150 million that I think we're leaning towards putting in a new build there, just for timing and just other factors that makes the most sense. So we think it's likely going to be a new build. That $150 million reflects new build. And then depending on infrastructure, one of the lead time -- long lead time items is getting electricity out of these plants. These are typically electric plants. But I'd say, think of it as kind of '18 months or so, 12 to 18 months, depending on how much -- how far you have to go and the like. So that gives us confidence that we'd be able to do something in the back half of '22.
Christine Cho: And when would you - so like how much could that impact CapEx this year?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. Really depending on when we greenlight and, say, we're seeing enough strength in volumes, it could have some impact to CapEx this year. We didn't change our CapEx guidance. We had really strong performance on our growth CapEx in Q1. So I think it remains to be seen whether we need to update our CapEx or not depending on the timing of that plant because we do have a range in there.
Christine Cho: Got it. Thank you
Matthew Meloy: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Your question please?
John Mackay: Thanks for the time. I wanted to circle back on CapEx. We've seen a pretty big increase in steel prices over the last couple of months. I imagine you're largely covered for 2021. But just curious if you could talk about maybe the impact on 2022 CapEx. And just more generally, how we should think about input costs potentially going up.
Matthew Meloy: Yes. And we have seen some input costs increase. So you're right, steel and just a number of other commodities have increased significantly. That will have some upward pressure on costs. But I'd say what we're seeing now is more than an offset on the labor side with - it's not in the heated environment we were in 24 months ago. So being able to negotiate rates on the labor and contracting side is offsetting that. So that's why the $150 million we said for the plant -- I think for our last plant new build, we indicated it was around $165 million. So all in, it is a net benefit with this lower level of activity.
John Mackay: That's helpful. Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up, M&A across the market is picking up again slightly, at least on the asset side. Can you just kind of talk a little bit about what you're seeing, how you're thinking about maybe corporate M&A more generally? And then also, if there's any updates on the non-core sales side? Thanks.
Matthew Meloy: Sure. For us, as we look out, there are a number of smaller acquisitions that are out there and, I guess, available. We still look at it here. It's a really high hurdle for us to go and acquire something. We have good opportunities on the organic side. And our focus, as we talked about earlier, is on reducing our leverage and simplifying. So that's really going to be our focus now. We have a really good footprint on the G&P side that's feeding our downstream business. So we're not in a position where we have a need to go and do something to utilize our downstream assets. We have a really good footprint. So I think we're going to be patient there and continue to evaluate those opportunities and look at them relative to our organic growth opportunities and our leverage targets and goals. That said - I mean we always look at things. So there may be something that's bolt-on relatively small that could work for us. I'd just say it's still -- it's a relatively high hurdle for us as we are focused on reducing our leverage.
Jennifer Kneale: Related to non-core asset sales, there's no update. We don't have any processes underway right now. But as always, we're looking across the portfolio to see if there's anything that makes sense for us to divest.
John Mackay: All right. That’s great. Thank you very much.
Matthew Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tristan Richardson with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Tristan Richardson: Hey. Good morning, guys. Appreciate all the comments, covered a lot of ground this morning. I just wanted to follow up on one earlier question on the updated financial guidance. I mean, Jen, you talked about it extensively. It seems to capture your new commodity assumptions as well as impacts from the storm and OpEx adjustments. But thinking about the volume side, as we continue to see price response on the part of producers, does that offer incremental opportunity this year versus your volume guide that we should think of as pretty consistent with where it was even at the beginning of this year?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. I would say we are seeing some increase in activity from some of the smaller producers we have on our system. So if we are here in the 60s, I think the longer that we're here, the more kind of response you're going to see from those folks. Yes. I still think from our larger customers on the supply side don't see a lot of change in what they're telling us in terms of their volume expectations for this year. If we hang around here for the duration of this year, I could see potentially in late 2021, but probably really into 2022, maybe there's additional ramp in activity from some of our larger customers. But in the aggregate, I'd say that there is some potential upside to this year. But to really get the larger guys moving, it's more about what's their free cash flow targets, their debt reduction plans and the like. So - and I'd also point out, we are holding to our volume guidance. We saw a significant -- I mean we significantly underperformed in the first quarter because of the winter storm. So there's some kind of implied strength in the remaining part of this year because the first quarter was way under our expectations, but we still feel good about our overall volume range.
Tristan Richardson: That's helpful. Thanks, Matt. And then I guess just thinking, Jen, you noted no update on the non-core side, obviously, containing one of the portfolio. I guess we've seen some healthy markers on gas assets in the market. So I guess to the extent you have the capacity you need locked up for the foreseeable time frame, just curious on how strategic or how core you view your equity stake on the long-haul gas side.
Jennifer Kneale: Tristan, we've been fairly open that our minority stake in Gulf Coast Express is certainly something that we could consider selling if it made sense to the right counterparty at the right value. That is one of the assets that is in the DevCo. So that clearly complicates any process that we might want to undertake in the relative short term. But that's definitely something that we will continue to evaluate, particularly as we think about taking out the DevCos and then owning that full interest again in Gulf Coast Express. That's certainly one of the assets that we've previously identified as an asset that we could potentially divest.
Tristan Richardson: Helpful. Thank you guys, very much.
Matthew Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Jennifer Kneale: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Keith Stanley: Hi, thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to clarify on the preferred stock when the takeout steps down to 105%, was it Q1 2022 or '23?
Jennifer Kneale: No. It steps down from 110% to 105% in - really the end of Q1 of 2022.
Keith Stanley: Okay. So when you think about timing, do you think you'd have financial capacity however you're going to take that out with, I assume, debt and cash to do that pretty early in 2022? Or would you need to wait a little since you're kind of absorbing the DevCo at the same time? I'm just trying to get a sense of when the big simplification items could be complete.
Jennifer Kneale: Frankly, it's something that we are continuing to assess, Keith. So continued outperformance this year will give us more flexibility, more capacity to potentially redeem parts or more of the TRC preferred earlier. I think our ability to effectively take out the DevCo and the TRC pref is largely dependent on where our leverage is and what our pathing looks like with the rating agencies. I think that's a big component that we'll be continuing to assess really as we move through the rest of this year and into next year. So would we have the liquidity to do it and the ability to do it concurrent or around the same time in 2022? I think yes. But what are the implications of that with the rating agencies related to our leverage ratios, et cetera, is something that we'll be continuing to assess again as we move through the rest of this year and into next year.
Keith Stanley: Got it. Thank you.
Jennifer Kneale: Okay. Thank you.
Matthew Meloy: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from James Carreker with U.S. Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.
James Carreker: Thanks for the question. Just wanted to circle back and try to maybe unpack Q1 results a little bit more. If I look sequentially, EBITDA was up $80 million versus Q4. You talked about the $30 million storm impact, but G&P volumes were down, frac volumes down, export volumes down. So are there some other buckets that could help explain exactly where the remainder of that delta is coming from?
Jennifer Kneale: James, this is Jen. I think if you look sequentially, we certainly benefited from lower costs, and we've talked about that a lot this morning. We also benefited from the $30 million of what we characterize as an aggregate net benefit. So that takes into account all of the negatives associated with lower volumes, and we were still able to generate an additional $30 million of margin beyond all of the negatives associated with volumes. I talked a little bit earlier in one of the questions about additional marketing opportunities and essentially additional realized margin from marketing. So that's a small part of the sequential benefit quarter-over-quarter as well. And so I think those are really the large component pieces. Sanjay, am I missing anything?
Sanjay Lad: Just the non-controlling interest production being lower quarter-over-quarter as a result of some of the joint venture assets.
Jennifer Kneale: That's right. To Sanjay's point, the non-controlling interest cutback was lower in the first quarter than it was in the fourth quarter. And that's because our joint ventures were largely impacted on the negative side from some of the volume variances quarter-over-quarter as a result of the winter storm. And a lot of the aggregate net benefits that we've talked about was really more at sort of the corporate level.
James Carreker: And so I guess some of these, I guess, non-storm-related marketing margins, I guess, was there something that led to those opportunities being available that's not related to the weather?
Jennifer Kneale: We generally have marketing benefits that we're able to realize each quarter. And it's really dependent on market dynamics, et cetera, for what we benefit and where we benefit across our businesses when you look at a quarter-by-quarter basis. So as I mentioned, in the first quarter, we did benefit from some realized gains associated with contango trades that we entered into when there was steep contango in various commodity markets back in 2020, and some of that was realized in the first quarter. Some of that was also realized in the fourth quarter, but there was more sequential benefit in the first quarter than the fourth quarter.
James Carreker: Yes. I guess I'm just struggling because, I guess, wouldn't you have known about those commodity trades when putting out your prior guidance? So I'm just - I'm trying to, I guess, also bridge the gap between old guidance, new guidance, volume's flat, commodity prices up a little bit, $30 million storm impact. So I guess what else was kind of new information in this revised guidance?
Jennifer Kneale: I think that new information in the revised guidance was a lot of different elements, some of which we've talked about on the call. But I think there's also, frankly, just less conservatism in our guidance because we're now one quarter through the year. So we've got one quarter that's actualized where we actually had additional benefits from the winter storm that we previously had not expected. I think we also, again, feel like there's good stability related to where we are in terms of COVID and the potential future impacts on our business as a result of COVID and then there is continued commodity price tailwinds, and we were seeing I think pretty steep backwardation in commodity price markets when we came out with our guidance. So to the extent that we're able to continue to realize the benefits of those as we move through the rest of the year, that's certainly a benefit. And we're also seeing some of the benefits from higher prices on volumes, which, to Matt's point, is why we haven't changed any of our volume guidance despite volumes being lower in the first quarter than we certainly would have expected when we first came out with guidance.
James Carreker: Okay. Thank you for the comment.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks, James.
Matthew Meloy: Yes, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.
Sunil Sibal: Yes, hi. Good morning. And thanks for all the color on the call. I just wanted to explore the capital allocation part a little bit. So it seems like getting back - getting to IG is a higher priority. I was curious the way credit markets price your debt seems like already give you a fair bit of credit of the asset diversity and the quality of the asset. So are there any significant benefits beyond the financial benefits of transitioning to IG in terms of strategic benefits or any operational or contractual benefits that you expect to realize?
Jennifer Kneale: We have been a very strong, high-yield credit, Sunil, and I think have definitely benefited from that. But as we look forward, the benefits to becoming investment-grade and being a strong investment-grade credit are more than just financial. Our ability to issue longer-term debt, for instance, is a positive. The fact that generally, the market for investment-grade debt stays open versus we have had to successfully sort of reopen the high-yield market more than once through Targa's history. So those are also financial benefits. But I think just in terms of working with counterparties, being investment-grade is a benefit as well. It changes that dialogue a little bit, makes it a little bit easier. And so I think that we see a lot of both intangible and tangible benefits. And that's why this has always been a priority of ours. We've always just articulated that we expected the business to sort of get to investment-grade naturally over time as our growth capital spending came down, as our leverage ratios improved, as we benefited from increasing EBITDA, higher fee-based margins, more fee floors. So a lot of our efforts over the last couple of years have really been to set up this path to investment grade, and we certainly think it's one that we're on today and one that we think is important to us over the long term. We've all lived through a difficult last many years. And I think being investment-grade has shown its benefits to those credits that have been strong investment grades through a lot of volatility.
Sunil Sibal: Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And then on your Permian contracts, I think a couple of quarters back, you had indicated that about 60% of the contracts are now fee-based floors and the remaining are POP. Is that still kind of the right way to think about it? Or has there been more changes in that mix? Thanks.
Matthew Meloy: I'd say we continue to make progress on adding fee floors and fee-based components to our Permian contract. I think last time we gave the update, it was about 55%. I think we're continuing to make progress and move that higher. So a lot of those arrangements are fee floor. So they are still percentage of proceeds. They just have a minimum. And so earlier - last year, we were kind of underneath that fee floor now for a lot of those contracts we are moving above. So they're still POP, but they just have a minimum associated with them. And so I'd say we're at kind of 65% plus now, and we'll continue to make progress as we move forward.
Sunil Sibal: Got it. Thanks for the color.
Matthew Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I will pass the call back to Sanjay Lad for any final remarks.
Sanjay Lad: Great. Well, we thank everyone for participating in this morning's call and appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you and have a great day.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-23 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Targa Resources Corp. Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Sanjay Lad, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks, Cherry. Good morning, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call for Targa Resources Corp. The fourth quarter earnings release, along with the fourth quarter earnings supplement presentation for Targa Resources that accompany our call, are available on our website at targaresources.com in the Investors section. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. Statements made during this call that might include Targa Resources' expectations or predictions, should be considered forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings. Our speakers for the call today will be, Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer; and Jen Kneale, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, the following senior management team members will be available for the Q&A session, Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. And with that I will now turn the call over to Matt.
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay and good morning. 2020 had its ups and downs, but it ended up being a really good year for Targa. Record EBITDA, record volumes, but the thing I'm most proud of is how our Targa team responded to the numerous challenges throughout the year, including COVID-19. And now, with the recent cold weather that affected Texas and many other states, 2021 has arrived with its own challenges. Our employees have done a tremendous job, working in very difficult conditions, many without power, heat and water in their home. So, I'd like to thank Targa employees for all their hard work and dedication. We are exceptionally proud of our Targa team, who manage through these extreme conditions, and continue to operate our facilities safely. The most recent winter storm impacted, both our gathering and processing and downstream operations. Over the trailing 10 days, we experienced on average, a 50% reduction across our G&P and downstream system volumes. Volumes are continuing to ramp and current rates have since returned to around 90% of pre-severe weather levels. This overall event is still relatively short-term in nature, and we are comfortable with the full year 2021 guidance that we published last week. Our long-term business outlook continues to be strong. Let's now turn to 2020 highlights. Our overall business performed very well, led by our position in the Permian Basin and our integrated NGL platform. Full year, 2020 adjusted EBITDA of $1.64 billion, exceeded the top end of our guidance range and was within our initial range, presented in early 2020. We believe, that our key strategic efforts around recontracting to add fees in gathering and processing, reducing growth capital spending, identifying opportunities to reduce operating and G&A expenses, reducing our dividend and focusing on integrated opportunities, position us for a successful 2021 and beyond. In 2020, we completed several major projects on time and on budget, including two processing plants in the Permian, two fractionation trains in Mont Belvieu, the phased expansion of our LPG export capabilities and the extension of our Grand Prix pipeline into Central Oklahoma. These expansions position Targa to benefit from increasing operating leverage moving forward. Our total net growth capital spending for 2020 was about $600 million, which was about $100 million below, the bottom end of our range, driven by the high grading of growth opportunities and a huge effort by our engineers and operators to be creative and capital efficient.  In 2020, increasing EBITDA and reduced growth capital spending resulted in improving leverage metrics and we exited 2020 with reported leverage of 4.7 times, a meaningful reduction from the 5.5 times leverage to end 2019.  Higher EBITDA and lower growth CapEx also provided additional flexibility to be opportunistic throughout the year, which resulted in us buying back publicly-traded notes, common equity and a small piece of the TRC preferred shares all at very attractive prices.  Looking ahead, we estimate full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA to be between 1.65 -- $1.675 billion and $1.775 billion. Net growth capital spending in 2021 will be significantly lower, which we estimate to be between $350 million and $450 million, positioning us to generate increasing free cash flow after dividend to continue to reduce leverage.  We expect to end 2021 with reported leverage of around 4.25 times. This guidance is inclusive of our limited exposure from some of the recent government actions around activity on federal lands with less than 5% of Targa's Permian volumes currently from affected areas.  Let's now turn to our operational performance and business outlook. Starting in the Permian, during 2020 our systems across the Midland and Delaware Basins demonstrated significant resiliency despite reduced activity levels and temporary shut-ins, which impacted the industry.  Targa's 2020 Permian inlet volumes increased 19% over 2019 and we expect to benefit from this positive momentum as we move through 2021. During the fourth quarter, we took a number of our plants in the Permian Midland down for maintenance and this has allowed for improved NGL recoveries across our system.  We are seeing increasing activity levels across both our Midland and Delaware footprints. For 2021, we expect our average total Permian inlet volumes to increase between 5% and 10% over 2020.  With our Permian Midland system running close to capacity our new 200 million cubic feet per day Heim plant will be much needed and remains on track to begin operations during the fourth quarter of 2021 and we currently have adequate processing capacity in Permian Delaware to accommodate our anticipated growth in 2021.  The supply growth from our Permian G&P systems will continue to drive increasing volumes through our Grand Prix pipeline and our fractionation complex in Mont-Bellevue. In addition to incremental supply available to move across our LPG export facility.  Moving on to the Badlands, our gas volumes during the fourth quarter sequentially increased 4% and our crude volumes were flat relative to the third quarter. We are seeing activity levels and completions increase across our system, which is a positive sign.  Turning to our Central region, which continues to largely be in decline gas inlet volumes in the fourth quarter declined 5% over the third quarter. We continue to have some shut-in volumes in South Oak, which we expect to come back online in the first half of 2021.  Overall, we expect volumes across our central systems to be lower in 2021 relative to 2020. For 2021, we estimate the volume growth in our Permian region to offset anticipated declines across our central regions and estimate our total field G&P inlet volumes in 2021 to be flat year-over-year.  The durability of our Gathering and Processing segment margin has strengthened as we have reduced our commodity exposure by adding fees and fee floors to our G&P contracts. Our Permian G&P business is now approximately 65% fee-based. And overall, we estimate about 85% fee-based margin across all of Targa for 2021.  The financial performance of our G&P segment is now more driven by volume throughput and fees as opposed to direct commodity prices, which was evidenced in our 2020 results. With the fee floor arrangements we have in place, we will continue to benefit as prices rise.  Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment, our Grand Prix pipeline continues to perform very well. Fourth quarter throughput volumes on Grand Prix sequentially increased 18% driven by increasing NGL production from Targa's Permian plants including our new gateway plant.  Our Grand Prix extension in the Central Oklahoma began operations at the end of the fourth quarter. We expect strong performance on Grand Prix to continue throughout 2021 and estimate deliveries into Mont-Bellevue to increase 25% or more over 2020 average throughput.  At our fractionation complex in Mont Belvieu, fourth quarter fractionation volumes remained strong and also benefited from working down inventory we built as a result of our scheduled maintenance and upgrades performed during the third quarter at our facilities. Our LPG export services business at Galena Park continued to perform well, as we moved the Targa record 11.3 million barrels per month during the fourth quarter, benefiting from a full quarter of our recently completed phase expansion in addition to capturing some short-term volumes during the fourth quarter driven by strong fundamentals, and the outlook for full 2021 remains strong. In the past, we have talked about capacity at our export facility to be about 15 million barrels per month. Now that we've gone through a full quarter of operations following our expansion and to appropriately manage expectations going forward, we think that our effective working capacity at Galena Park is about 12.5 million barrels per month. There is potential to exceed that for a given month if we load more butanes, but we think that up to 12.5 million barrels per month is a better representation of our overall working capacity. As we look forward, we are in a position where we expect to have the ability to capture growth opportunities from the Permian without having to spend much incremental CapEx on Grand Prix fractionation or LPG export facilities. This puts Targa in a position to generate strong returns going forward and increasing free cash flow after dividends available to reduce debt and further strengthen our financial position. With our premier integrated asset position and our talented employees Targa is well positioned for the longer-term. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jen.
Jen Kneale: Thanks Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $438 million, increasing 5% over the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, Targa generated free cash flow of $215 million. Higher sequential operating expenses were primarily attributable to certain one-time hurricane repairs and integrity spending during the fourth quarter, and additional assets being fully online. Higher G&A expenses were attributable to higher compensation and legal costs. Our full year 2020 reported adjusted EBITDA was $1.64 billion, exceeding the high end of our financial guidance range and we generated $575 million of free cash flow in the year. Through extensive cost reduction efforts, in 2020 we achieved significant aggregate expense savings versus our plan and we expect many of these savings to carry forward into 2021 and beyond particularly related to labor. Looking to 2021, we do expect operating and G&A expenses to be modestly higher than 2020, largely from additional assets and service that will drive both additional OpEx and ad valorem costs and also higher insurance costs. Greater volume throughput across our system will also result in higher costs. We remain significantly hedged for 2021 and continue to add hedges for 2021 and beyond. Relative to when we last reported in November, we added incremental hedges beyond our programmatic levels across most commodities, as we benefited from higher prices particularly in the prompt year. You can find our usual hedge disclosures in our earnings supplement presentation. During the fourth quarter and through the start of this year, we've continued to make progress on another one of our priorities; capital structure simplification. In the fourth quarter we redeemed our $125 million of 9% preferred units at CRP and will benefit from interest and administrative cost savings. We also purchased at par approximately $46 million of our 9.5% preferred shares at TRC, which become callable at 110% of par in March of 2021, so benefited from a discounted price and interest savings. In both the fourth quarter and thus far in 2021, we are continuing to manage our liquidity position. We issued $1 billion of new senior notes due in 2032 at an attractive 4% coupon. This allows us to push our maturity stack and generate interest savings and we currently have about $2.7 billion of available liquidity providing significant flexibility looking forward. Our consolidated reported debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 4.7 times. As Matt mentioned, our progress on improving our leverage ratio is well underway improving from 5.5 times at the end of 2019 to 4.7 times at the end of 2020 to an expectation of around 4.25 times at the end of 2021. As we move towards our long-term consolidated leverage ratio target of three to four times. Since our November earnings call disclosure, we repurchased an additional approximately 980,000 shares of common stock under our $500 million share repurchase program. In total, we have repurchased approximately $92 million of common shares, at an average price of $16.68 per share. We received a lot of positive feedback from our additional DevCo disclosures in November, and have no changes to the underlying assumptions that we presented then. Our base case continues to be a full repurchase of the DevCo joint ventures in the first quarter of 2022, which would create attractive EBITDA growth in 2022 over 2021, and be an approximately leverage-neutral transaction. Building off of our strong performance in 2020 and Matt's detail on our operating performance expectations for 2021, we estimate full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA to increase 5% over 2020 based on the midpoint of our range. Our growth capital spending for 2021 will be meaningfully lower, as we completed substantially all of our remaining major projects in 2020. We estimate 2021 net growth CapEx to be between $350 million and $450 million, and net maintenance CapEx for 2021 of approximately $130 million. As mentioned, we expect to end 2021 with reported leverage of around 4.25 times, based on the midpoint of our 2021 EBITDA and CapEx estimates. Our consolidated leverage ratio will improve both from an expectation of higher EBITDA plus lower debt, as we expect to prioritize available free cash flow for debt repayment. We do not expect to be a significant cash taxpayer through at least 2024, based on current rules and our expectations for earnings and growth capital spending. There are no changes to our approach to capital allocation in 2021. Our priorities continue to be: one, improving our leverage ratios; and two, simplifying our corporate structure. In 2020, we were able to allocate capital to different opportunities that were presented to us, repurchasing debt, common shares and TRC preferred shares, plus redeeming the TRP preferred and looking forward, we will continue to be opportunistic as our expectation of strong performance will provide us with flexibility. For additional details related to our estimated 2021 outlook, please review our earnings supplement slides that accompany our webcast this morning, and which are also posted to the Investor's page of our website. Finally, I would like to echo Matt's comments that our business is performing very well across difficult periods, and my thank you to every Targa employee as we are so extremely proud of the continued exceptional performance of our entire Targa team. And with that, I will turn the call back to Sanjay.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks Jen. We kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up and re-enter the Q&A line up, if you have additional questions. Cherry, would you please open the lines for Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning. Hope everyone is well.
Matt Melo: Hey, good morning, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: Thanks. Just want to touch base on the guidance as you laid it out here. I was just trying to get a feel for the shape of the guidance over the year, if the second half kind of steps up over the first half year. And just want to think about if, it looks like the guidance might have been formed kind of at the end of last year and you provided the commodity price sensitivity, so we can bridge that to the strip and we can walk it up for the current commodity prices. But I was just curious, I guess, if it was set back then commodity prices have moved up have conversations with producers changed over that time period? Do you see the potential for maybe more activity than when you formulated the guidance at that point?
Matt Melo: Yeah. Hey, Jeremy. Yeah. When we pulled together the guidance what's driving the growth is largely projects coming online throughout 2020 getting full year credit for that. And then, we're also anticipating 5% to 10% growth in the Permian. As volumes grow in the Permian, we'll be able to capture a fee for gathering and processing, but then also capturing the majority of those liquids down Grand Prix frac and then driving more exports. So I think as volumes trend higher across the Permian that's going to move growth generally in that direction throughout the year. You've seen in the past, we have had some seasonal impacts from our wholesale propane business and others, which do come into add margin in Q4 and Q1, relative to Q2 and Q3. But generally speaking, we're going to see a growth trajectory for Targa.
Jeremy Tonet: Great. Thanks. And just want to jump on to the comments as far as long-term leverage being three to four times, and if you're exiting this year 4.25 presumably. You, kind of, get to that three to four range at some point next year. And I was just wondering, how you think about the company at that point with regards to potentially reaching an investment-grade rating, or increasing dividend, or pressing down leverage lower? Just wanted to see once you get into that range, how you think about moving forward at that point?
Jen Kneale: Good morning, Jeremy, this is Jen. I think from our perspective we've been very transparent on becoming investment grade is also a priority of ours one that we think will occur naturally just given the projection of our business. So I think you're exactly right. We feel like we'll exit 2021 in very good shape. And that means that leverage should move into that long-range target when we get into 2022. I think given all of the uncertainty that we've all lived through over the last year plus in commodity markets, Matt and I have a preference for leverage to be lower than sort of getting to four times and staying around four times. But ultimately we'll have to see does that mean we're comfortable between 3.5 to four times, or would we like to move leverage lower? And that will also partially be dependent on opportunities we're seeing to continue to invest growth capital to engage in share repurchases et cetera. So we'll continue to evaluate as we move through time. But I think that we feel like we're exceptionally well-positioned as we look at the guidance and what it will mean for where we exit this year and what that will translate into going forward for the long-term.
Jeremy Tonet: That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson from Truist Securities. Your line is now open.
Tristan Richardson: Hey good morning guys. Just to maybe follow-up on the previous question. I think we're, kind of, consistently hearing from midstream players that the outlook today will encourage producer activity throughout the year that suggests upside from budgets that may have been prepared previously. Does the high end of the guide incorporate that assumption for just improved activity beyond what we're seeing today, or is the high end of the guide just really kind of on the commodity price assumptions you're seeing today, and on sort of current customer behavior you're seeing today?
Matt Meloy: Yeah. Hey, good morning Tristan. Yeah, I would say when we put this together it had a $50 crude oil environment in it. I think as we look at producer expectations, we are hearing from -- especially our larger producer customers more discipline around maintaining their plans and drilling plans for the year even in the face of increasing commodity prices. That said we have seen the rig count move up. We have seen frac crew’s increase steadily. So to the extent we're meaningfully above that there could be some upside if prices hold here and stay like this throughout the year. I think that the incremental volumes at least on our system would come likely more from the small mid-cap producers who decide to add a rig or increase their activity as they generate more cash flow. And then we could also see some additional upside up in the Badlands, up in the Bakken area. If prices -- it is more price-sensitive up there. So we could see some more potential upside if prices are well in excess of our planning assumption.
Tristan Richardson: That's helpful Matt. And then just really briefly the follow-up I guess would be, is it too early to generally quantify the magnitude of the disruption we've seen over the past couple of weeks, or there's just a general framework or the way to think about the magnitude of what occurred and how that may translate to the guidance?
Matt Meloy: Sure. I'd say, we are continuing to assess that. We're still ramping up. As I've said in the script we're about at 90% of pre-storm levels. So we're not back to where we were before yet. And part of quantification of that as we look through our assets -- over the last 10 days we were about at kind of an average of 50% rates across most of our businesses, which is really significant compared to winter storms we've experienced in the past. But when we look across our businesses, across our systems we're comfortable that that was a short-term event and we're still comfortable with our annual guidance that we provided. 
Tristan Richardson: Make sense. Thank you guys very much.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is now open.
Shneur Gershuni: Hi. Good morning, guys. Before I get to my two questions just want to confirm something you said to Tristan's first question. Did you say there was upside to the range or upside within the range for the outcomes that you talked about? 
Matt Meloy: Hey, Shneur. Good morning. Yes, I think, as I talked about it it's -- we did prepare that late last year in a, kind of, $50 crude world $0.55 NGL world. To the extent we're meaningful above that for extended period of time there could be more volumes than our range that we gave. It's still -- we're here in February and what we've experienced so far this year is some negatives to that right with the freeze offs and things that we saw early this year. So I think we're still comfortable with the 5% to 10% range we gave in the Permian, but it's still early in the year. 
Shneur Gershuni: Okay. I appreciate that. Just wanted to focus on the recent debt raise that you did at the beginning of February. Originally you came to market for $500 million and then it was upside to $1 billion. I think you got 4% rates on it which seemed very attractive. I want to be careful not to use that we're prefunding as cash is ultimately fungible. But does this create added financial flexibility when thinking about Targa in terms of what you have in the upcoming year? Does it allow you to more easily finance the DevCo when the MOIC and the IRR cross at some point late this year or early next year? Just wondering if you can give us some thoughts around that?
Jen Kneale: Good morning, Shneur. This is Jen. I mean, absolutely it provides us with additional flexibility. And so by being able to term out additional debt, free up our revolvers as well as clean up some other series of notes that were callable just increases the flexibility that we have. We've got $2.7 billion of available liquidity. I wouldn't say that this is us trying to do something in advance of taking out the DevCos in Q1 of 2022, it's us being opportunistic. And we thankfully have benefited from a very robust high-yield market. So the opportunity to be able to issue $1 billion at 4% in our view was something that we wanted to utilize and do. So our prior assumptions may have been that we access the debt markets later in the year. Now we've been able to do that at again a very attractive rate earlier than we may have been assuming under prior scenarios. 
Shneur Gershuni: Yes. Thank you for that. And for my official follow-up question just when, sort of, thinking about the drivers within your guidance for this year is it possible to rank order in terms of impact? What would drive you to the upper end? Is it specifically volumes through G&P? Is it volumes on Grand Prix, or should we be thinking downstream? Which one would give you the biggest impact in terms of moving towards the upper end? 
Matt Meloy: Yes, Shneur. As we think about variability within our range I think, for us the impact really starts for volumes out in the Permian because we're going to capture a G&P fee and then that does translate into Grand Prix volumes fractionation volumes and ultimately export volume. So if we're on the strong side of that or if things ramp a little higher out there that would be additional margin for us or additional EBITDA for us. I'd also say there's -- we have seen variability in what producers have told us and they've actually come back maybe even stronger than our initial expectations up in the Badlands. So to the extent there's more activity up there that could be some upside for us as well. 
Jen Kneale: And then on price Shneur certainly to the extent that we continue to see prices at these levels or higher we would benefit. As Matt said in his scripted comments, we do have fee floors in a number of our G&P contracts. So recent prices are higher then that may create some margin uplift beyond what was assumed in the various scenarios underpinning our guidance range. 
Shneur Gershuni: Perfect. Thank you very much for that. Appreciate it. And please stay safe and stay warm.
Jen Kneale: Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ujjwal Pradhan from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Ujjwal Pradhan: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch on your 2021 CapEx budget of $350 million to $450 million and the components of that. Other than well connect and the Heim plant invest spending, is there anything else baked into that budget? And maybe if you can speak to the range as well? 
Matt Meloy: Sure. Yes the major project in there is the Heim plant which is about $90 million. Most of that $90 million is in 2021. The rest would relate to fields growth that's compression pipelines bringing additional volumes to our processing facilities. And so, I'd say the range would also correlate to the range of our expected growth out in the Permian. If we get a little bit more growth out there and we're at the high side, it's likely going to come with more additional field level CapEx out there as well. So that's why we gave a range. We have some additional growth spending for additional connectivity around Belvieu as we're growing volumes. We have additional capital in there for that as well. It's not a – those aren't -- we don't usually call those out but there's some smaller items that aggregate some amount of capital there in the downstream as well. So if there's more activity more volumes you could have more connections downstream and also more capital spending on the G&P side. 
Ujjwal Pradhan: Thanks Matt. And as a follow-up I wanted to get your latest thoughts on midstream M&A. Certainly we have seen some activity materialize recently including a transaction in the Mid-Con. What is Targa's latest thoughts on potentially being a buyer or a seller of assets? And more likely how you think about potentially divesting some of the declining G&P based assets? 
Matt Meloy: Yes. I'd say our view on that really hasn't changed. We have seen some activity from others. We have a really good position stand-alone being able to invest organically in our Permian footprint. We have millions of acres dedicated to us really good producer customers and relationship that's going to provide us with growth for years to come. So we don't feel like we have a need or we have to go out and fill a hole or acquire something. We have a really good position on the G&P side and our NPL side of the business. So we'll be opportunistic. We'd continue to look if there's some opportunities that line up with the overall targets and metrics that we talked about earlier. We want to continue to deleverage generate free cash flow and the like. So if we can find some acquisitions that fit into that and compete with our organic growth spending I think we'd continue to take a hard look at those. But it's a pretty high hurdle for that to actually occur. So I think most of what you're going to see here at least in the short medium term it's going to be us focused on organic growth. 
Ujjwal Pradhan: Appreciate your comments. Thanks Matt.
Matt Meloy: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christine Cho from Barclays. Your line is now open.
Christine Cho: Thank you. Good morning. So if I could follow-up to Tristan's question about the weather impact and recognizing that you're still comfortable with the guidance range, but I just want to maybe understand how things in operations actually work. So you're highly hedged for natural gas this year. And as we think about the weather events last week, is there a scenario in which you still have to deliver the gas and with your plants offline, you're actually short gas and you actually have to buy it in the open market, or do you have gas in storage that would make that scenario unlikely, or was the price upside for volumes coming out of the plants that were still online more than offsetting that? Like how should I think about that? 
Matt Meloy: Sure. Yes. As it relates to the weather impact on our corporate hedges, so two things; one, we have cushion to the volumes that we hedge. So when we hedge it's an -- it'd be a monthly volume amount. So as we were down -- as we were down it would eat into that cushion that we have. So we talked about hedging 90% of our volumes for 2021. So we have some cushion for instances like these. Also when we hedge we're hedging versus first a month. So the huge price spike that you saw was cash or spot market our hedges are not settled against the cash or spot market. They're hedged against first a month and those were relatively normal prices. So relative to our hedging program, we don't see a big minus or plus there.
Christine Cho: Okay. Helpful. And then in fourth quarter, I believe some of the NGLs that were moving on third-party pipes moved on to your pipes. Did you get a full quarter impact from that, or is there some spillover into 1Q? And then I think there's still some more volumes that will migrate onto your system over the next several years. But would you be able to quantify how much we should expect in future years, or just any other color that would help us frame how we should think about it?
Matt Meloy: Yeah. So we've -- since Grand Prix has been in operation, we've continued as contracts roll move volumes from other pipelines on to ours. We did have some of that here in the back half of last year. And we're going to over the next several years kind of have some more, right? So we're not giving specific clarity on the amount or size or when those happen, but just kind of talk generally. And so we did have some of that in the back half of 2021. I think as we go forward here for the short medium term most of what we have in terms of Grand Prix growth is going to be from organic growth across our footprint and from third-party customers where we have commitments and acreage dedications.
Jen Kneale: And part of why we gave guidance Christine on Grand Prix is just because it's ramped so rapidly, since it came into service. It's generally not our practice to give single asset guidance. But for this one we thought it was important when you looked at 2021 relative to 2020 just because we did have a rapid ramp as we moved through really the pipe coming in service in late 2019.
Christine Cho: So it sounds like the fourth quarter number is a good starting point and we just layer on whatever growth we expect from the Permian for you guys? Is that kind of accurate?
Matt Meloy: I'd say that's a reasonable assumption. We're -- there's always some amount of transportation volumes that we have that are on shorter term. But those come and go. And so we think starting with Q4 and then building on some growth is a reasonable expectation. We could have some pluses or minuses from shorter-term volume and more.
Christine Cho: Got it. Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Spiro Dounis: Matt, hey, Jen. Just wanted to follow-up on ethane recovery just to get a sense of how much that could be a tailwind into 2021. I know last year for a good portion of it I think you were fully recovering the Permian, not sure what the case was in other basins. But just curious, how you're thinking about that potential tailwind in 2021, how much of that's incorporated in the guidance? 
Matt Meloy: Sure. Yeah. In terms of ethane recovery, we have done a lot of work on our processing plants out in West Texas to basically be able to recover more ethane. So as that work was kind of getting done and wrapping up last year, we still have some more to do that could increase recoveries on our G&P system and bring incremental volumes down Grand Prix and frac. So I'd say there's some potential for upside, but we've been for the most part in recovery on most of our processing within GMP, not all of it, but within most. So there will be some upside from just better mechanical recoveries from us doing maintenance work on our processing plants.
Spiro Dounis: Okay. Understood. That's helpful. And Jen second one is for you. Just with respect to the DevCo interest. I know you're not changing any of your base case assumptions. But and I think one of the data points you provided at last quarter's call was an implied acquisition multiple in the five to six time range. It seems like market has tightened considerably since then has improved since then. Things seem to be going well. So just curious splitting hairs in a little bit, but just curious if that multiple is trending closer to the 5times as opposed to the 6 times at this point?
Jen Kneale: I think when you think about the three assets that are in the DevCos you've had GCX which is essentially take-or-pay residue pipeline, you've got our frac train that essentially has been running well utilized since it came in service. So you're really pointing at Grand Prix to potentially say is it performing better this quarter versus our expectations when we put that out in November. I mean, I'd say that it's not a material change. We have had very robust expectations for Grand Prix and it's absolutely continuing to deliver as a game-changer for our company. But I wouldn't say that there's a material change there such that you should be thinking that it's altering our base case assumptions Spiro. 
Spiro Dounis: Understood. Helpful color. Thanks everybody. Be well.
Matt Meloy: Hey thank you.
Jen Kneale: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes through the line of Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Keith Stanley: Hi thanks. First question just curious the outlook you guys see for LPG exports. We saw really good growth in the second half of the year with the expansion. Curious how much of the volumes we saw especially in Q4 have to do with favorable winter -- kind of a favorable winter season globally versus how much you expect that that level of exports could really be sustained through the year with new contracts and I guess the markets staying strong?
Matt Meloy: Yes sure. On the export side, we really did have a favorable export market in Q4. You saw us kind of have record results over 11 million barrels. I think longer term a lot of the fundamentals that set up a strong Q4 are going to be there over the longer term. But here in the first quarter you've seen some headwinds related to weather impacts propane ship availability, you have had some issues here in the first quarter. I think those are going to work themselves out over time as supply kind of comes back on the Y-grade NGL side as we're making more propane it's going to have to hit the water and clear. So, I think going forward, longer term expectations are very good for exports. There will be some weakness or softness in the first quarter.
Keith Stanley: Great. And second question just on a follow-up on what happened last week in Texas. First just how do you buy electricity in Texas? Is it mainly through sort of market prices, or do you have fixed rate contracts or hedges for most of your needs? And then just clarifying all the comments on the call so far. It sounds like the impacts of the events last week it's primarily just short-term volume impacts on your assets being down for this period and that's really primarily what we're looking at.
Matt Meloy: Yes. Sure. I mean as it relates to the weather impacts, I really don't want to get into specifics on how -- I mean it's different for different assets. Different in downstream than it is on G&P. We have a number of arrangements on electricity. But when we look at the total how we buy electricity how volumes have moved across all of our footprint we're comfortable with our guidance range. So, I think that's where we stand on the kind of in aggregate impacts on the weather. 
Keith Stanley: Thanks.
Matt Meloy: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond from Simmons Energy. Your line is now open.
Pearce Hammond: Good morning. Just one question from me. I'm just curious do you see any new business opportunities for Targa related to the energy transition to capitalize on Targa's core competencies whether that be in carbon capture storage hydrogen whatever have related to the energy transition? Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Sure. Absolutely. Yes. As it relates to new business opportunities I think first we'd look -- I just want to reiterate that natural gas, NGLs, LPGs we think this business is going to be around for a long time for decades to come. But with that said we are continuing to look at other opportunities. We think we have time to evaluate those to see if any of those make sense for Targa. But we are right now actively looking at whether we want to participate in renewable projects wind and solar. So, we're evaluating those. They don't necessarily have to be from a capital position. We can participate in those as an off-take because we are a large purchaser of electricity. So, we can support those projects without necessarily putting capital into those projects. So, we're looking to see how we can be a part of that kind of renewable solution there. And as it relates to carbon capture I'd say there are some opportunities for us in that area that would fit our core competences laying pipeline gathering and aggregating CO2. So, we are looking at some of those projects as well. I'd say stay tuned. There's more to come there. There is more to come on that and we do have some time to kind of continue to evaluate about what is our role going to be in that. It doesn't necessarily have to be from a capital position. If we're going to spend capital, we need to earn a good return on that. But there are other ways to participate in those projects as well.
Pearce Hammond: Okay. Thank you very much Matt for the helpful answer.
Matt Meloy: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Michael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just want to follow-up on the LPG export question. In particular, just wanted to better understand the impact for the last couple of weeks with the freezing weather, is that a -- is this just a -- I wanted to understand I guess, the better -- really the operational impacts? And is it really very short-term and now things are back up, or I guess I'm looking for more like a real-time look into how that business is recovering this week.
Scott Pryor: Hey, Michael, this is Scott. Let me just, I guess complement some of the things that Matt was saying earlier. When you look at the fourth quarter, for instance, the 11.3 million barrels that we had across the dock during that quarter, certainly benefited from our phased-in expansion, which was inclusive of our third refrigeration unit at Galena Park. But it also benefited from cold weather really across the globe, especially in the Far East. And then of course, we were able to squeeze in a number of spot cargoes during that fourth quarter. So in aggregate, we had a lot of benefit in the quarter that put us over that 11 million barrels. When we look at the first quarter, as Matt alluded to, we've had some FOB delays during the first half of this quarter. Certainly the weather event last week had an impact to our operations. But we've made great progress in putting the facility back online. So we are back to loading cargoes at this point. This -- obviously though the event tightens up our schedule for our term lifters. So the opportunity for spot cargoes that we saw similar in the fourth quarter is tougher. But we still -- when we look at the long term view of the facility, both for 2021 and beyond, the fundamental stack up very positively in our favor.
Michael Blum: Great. And then, just one follow-up to that. In terms of the, what's going on in the congestion at the Panama Canal, do you see that as just a short-term issue that gets resolved, or do you think that's a longer-term issue and maybe changes some of the routes permanently for LPG cargoes?
Scott Pryor: We've seen a number of delays throughout the second half of last year as things started tightening up at the Panama Canal. The expansion obviously that took a number of years to put in place, but has been in place for a few years now certainly helped transit times, both for LPGs as well as larger cargoes transiting the canal. With that said, LPG has had some difficulties and has had a number of delays during that second half of the year. We have seen improvement during the back half of the fourth quarter. You've seen charter rates that have come down significantly over the course of the last four weeks. So things are improving. But, I think there's always a decision to make for the vessel owners. Do they take the transit through the Panama Canal, or do they go ahead and move around the Cape of Good Hope? So those are always decisions that can be made and depends upon what the delays look like, what the transit times look like relative to the markets they're going to. So, those are decisions that are made periodically throughout various quarters and months.
Michael Blum: Great, thank you very much.
Scott Pryor: Thank you, Michael.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you, Michael.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Carreker from U.S. Capital Advisors. Your line is now open.
James Carreker: Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions. Just wondering if you guys might talk about just the Permian outlook and the potential for new plants there. You've obviously got the Heim plant coming in later this year. What could the time line be for the next plant there? And can you kind of compare that to how much remaining capacity is out in the Delaware? And what would be the time line to potentially needing something on the Delaware side?
Matt Meloy: Yes. Sure. Thanks for the question, James. As we look through out at the Permian, every time we brought a plant on, it's been fully utilized relatively quickly. We would expect the same to occur when we have the Heim plant later this year. So I think as we see volumes, how they respond, coming back from these recent weather events, but also what the volumes look like relative to the commodity price environment we're in. Kind of in the first part of this year, I think we'll be likely making a decision of do we need another plant? Maybe that slips to the back half of this year. But I think at some point in this year we'll have enough visibility to say, well, we think not only Heim is going to be full, but we need to add another plant. And we've already been evaluating options to add another one, another plant out there, whether it's moving another one of our plants from another area we have, or putting in a new plant. We're evaluating that to see what the best option is for Targa. This would be a really good add for us, adding additional processing in the Permian Midland when you get the G&P fee and then a transport frac and more volumes for export, really good economics for us. Now that we've got the capital in place on the downstream side of things. So a really good return for us, as volumes continue to grow out in the Midland. And on the Delaware side, with bringing on Falcon and Peregrine, it feels like we have more time more runway out there. So we're just going to continue to evaluate those volumes. There's also some excess capacity out there from other processors as well. So even if volumes ramp and we needed more capacity, we could even look at potential off loads, if it needed to bridge a gap for us there as we're building a new plant. So we have more flexibility out there. The capacity on the Midland side, just all around is tighter. 
James Carreker: Got you. I appreciate that color. And then, I guess, switching topics a bit, just on ESG. A lot of producers are now committing to reducing GHG emissions and intensity, just any thoughts for you guys about putting some emissions reductions targets out there this year or sometime in the near future?
Matt Meloy: Yes. I mean that is something we know it's been talked about quite a bit. A number of producers and other midstreamers have put targets out there. I'd say, that's something that we are taking a hard look at internally, amongst the management team and with our Board about what if any targets and goals we want internally and externally. So I'd say, we're in the evaluation process of that of, kind of, what the goals would be and how we'd articulate those, but we are working to reduce our overall emissions and continuing to kind of improve our metrics on flaring and emissions across the board, while we're evaluating what the best goals would be.
James Carreker: Thanks.
Matt Meloy: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is now open.
Shneur Gershuni: Hi, guys. Sorry for the follow-up question here. I just wanted to go back to the response on asset sales and divestments and so forth. It just sort of seems like the PE market is starting to heat up again. Any specific thoughts around the Badlands asset maybe sell it -- the balance of it or GCF for the Louisiana frac, just sort of like, get to a point where you're completely focused on the Permian system that you described earlier about the integrated benefits of it?
Jen Kneale: Shneur, this is Jen. I think that, we're very pleased that we sold the 45% interest in the Badlands to GSO when we did and they've been a great partner of ours. So we like the Bakken exposure that we have at this point in time. And do you think particularly when you look at what crude prices are beginning to look like for the next several years, hopefully there's even more upside there than we're currently forecasting. So we don't have any active processes underway related to asset sales. We've been very open upon acquiring the DevCos one of the assets that may make sense for us to consider selling would be something like our interest in Gulf Coast Express, where we are not the operator and we are not the majority owner. So I think something like that is more consistent with how we've talked publicly about potential divestitures. But clearly, part of our job is to look at any opportunities to liquidate any assets. But, again, we don't have any active processes underway right now.
Shneur Gershuni: All right. Perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate the clarification and have a great day.
Jen Kneale: Thanks, Shneur. You too.
Operator: I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Sanjay Lad.
Sanjay Lad: We thank everyone that was on the call this morning and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.

Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. And with that I will now turn the call over to Matt.
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay. Before we get into quarterly results, I would like to say how proud we are of our employees who safely navigated through an active gulf coast hurricane season during the third quarter. While the overall financial impact to Targa was minimal, we had many employees impacted personally and our heartfelt thoughts go out to them and their families I am also proud of our collective efforts and continuing to respond to the challenges associated with COVID-19 and would like to thank all of our employees for their continued focus and diligence in managing our operations very successfully through an incredibly difficult year. Turning to our business results, we had a strong third quarter as we continue to benefit from the strength of our Permian footprint and our integrated asset position. Our strong operational performance combined with reduced capital spending and the significant progress on reducing costs are driving increasing free cash flow which positions us to continue to execute on our long-term strategy of reducing leverage over time. 2020 has undoubtedly been a challenging year, but we believe that our key strategic efforts around our re-contracting and gathering and processing, reducing growth capital spending, identifying opportunities to reduce operating and G&A expenses and focusing on integrated opportunities position us for a successful 2020 and beyond. Based on our strong performance with EBITDA projected to be at the high end and capital spending at the low end of our range, we saw an opportunity to put in place a 500 million share repurchase program and still continue to reduce leverage overtime. We are always looking for opportunities around market dislocations and we believe we have the financial strength and business profile to execute on both. Let's now discuss the business environment and our operational performance. Starting in the Permian as a result of the quicker than anticipated rebounded prices and related producer activity across our Permian systems, our inlet volumes are on track to grow close to our initial 2020 plan pointing to a strong 2020 exit and positioning us well going into next year. Our overall Permian volumes increased 9% compared to the second quarter and our third quarter volumes grew 8% when compared to the first quarter average while the overall basin experienced a 2% decline in associated gas production over this period. This points to the strength of our overall footprint in the Permian continuing to outperform basin-wide results. Our new gateway plant commenced operations in early August and the addition of this incremental processing capacity has allowed for improved NGL recoveries across our system. With gateway already highly utilized we are in need of additional capacity in the midland basin. With our continued focus on managing capital spending and our need for incremental capacity in Permian midland to accommodate increasing production we are moving our Longhorn plant from North Texas. We are also renaming the plant to the Heim plant after Targa's Founding Chief Operating Officer Mike Heim. This 200 million cubic feet per day plan is expected to begin operations during the fourth quarter of 2021 and is expected to cost approximately 90 million. The Heim plant will drive attractive returns for Targa as a result of the significant capital savings combined with the incremental fee based margin earned to our logistics and transportation assets. This type of spending is in line with our strategy going forward to focus our capital allocation on high returning projects that leverage our integrated mid-stream platform. Moving on to the Badlands, our gas volume rebounded during the third quarter and we're up 23% over the second quarter. Across our Badlands crude system volumes were down 7% sequentially as certain volumes remain temporarily shut in during the third quarter. However, we are seeing some incremental production volumes return in the fourth quarter. Turning to our central region which continues to largely be in decline gas inlet volumes in the third quarter declined 9% over the second quarter. We continue to have some shut-in volumes in South Oak which we expect to come back online in 2021.  Despite declines across our central regions, our third quarter total field G&P volumes increased 4 sequentially led by our Permian region. The durability of our gathering and processing segment margin has strengthened as we have reduced our commodity exposure by adding fees and fee floors to our G&P contracts. Our Permian G&P business is now approximately 60% fee based which is a significant improvement from around 35% fee based in 2018 and overall we are about 80% fee based across all of Targa. The financial performance of our G&P segment is now more driven by volume throughput and fees as opposed to direct commodity prices which is evidence in our year-to-date results and will serve us well going forward as we are more insulated from lower commodity price environments, but would still continue to benefit when prices rise. Shifting to our logistics and transportation segment, our Grand Prix pipeline continues to perform very well. Third quarter throughput volumes on Grand Prix increased 18% driven by increasing NGL production from Targa's Permian plants including our new gateway plant and from our third party customers. We completed the first phase of pump station additions on Grand Prix increasing our transport capacity to approximately 400,000 barrels per day from the Permian basin. At our fractionation complex in Mont-Bellevue third quarter fractionation volumes were impacted by scheduled maintenance and upgrades at our facilities. As a result of the scheduled maintenance we expect higher volumes during the fourth quarter as we work off the associated inventory. Frac Train 8 commenced operations in Mont-Bellevue in September providing us with increased operational flexibility. Our Grand Prix extension into central Oklahoma is on track to be operational by the end of the fourth quarter where it will connect with Williams’s new Bluestem pipeline. Our LPG export business at Galena Park continued to perform well as we moved a Targo record 9.5 million barrels per month during the third quarter. We expect our LPG export volumes to be higher in the fourth quarter as we'll benefit from a full quarter contribution of our recently completed phase expansion. As we look forward, we are in a position where we expect to have the ability to capture growth volumes from the Permian without having to spend much incremental CapEx on Grand Prix, fractionation or LPG export facilities. This puts Targa in a position to generate strong returns going forward as increasing free cash flow after dividends available to reduce debt and further strengthen our financial position. In September, we released our second annual sustainability report which highlights Targa's advancements in the areas of ESG and safety. With our premier integrated asset position and our talented employees Targa is well positioned for the longer term. With that I will now turn the call over to Jen. 
Jen Kneale: Thanks Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $419 million increasing 19% over the second quarter. During the third quarter, Targa generated free cash flow of $189 million or $143 million of free cash flow after dividends to our preferred and common shareholders. We continue to focus on our cost production efforts resulting in essentially flat aggregate G&A and OpEx in Q3 versus Q2 despite new assets being placed in service. Looking towards the fourth quarter, we expect OpEx and G&A to be higher while we are very tightly managing our costs we are benefiting from increasing throughput particularly in the Permian through our downstream assets and we will also have more assets in service for the full quarter. Managing our costs continues to be a huge organizational focus and we appreciate the continued efforts of all of our employees. As matt described, our fee based margin continues to increase backed by our significant progress to increase fee margin and fee floors in our G&P business combined with increasing volumes moving through our logistics and transportation assets. We remain significantly hedged for the balance of year 2020 and for full year 2021 and you can find our usual hedge disclosures in our earnings supplement presentation. We continue to estimate 2020 net growth CapEx to be around $700 million with about $520 million of net spending through the third quarter. We now estimate 2020 net maintenance CapEx to be approximately $110 million. On a debt compliance basis, TRP's leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was approximately 4.1 times versus a compliance covenant of 5.5 times. Our consolidated reported debt to EBITDA ratio was approximately 4.8 times as we continue on the deleveraging path that we expected entering 2020 given most of our major growth capital projects are now online. During the third quarter we successfully issued $1 billion of 4% and 7% to 8% senior notes due 2031. This was essentially a debt for debt exchange as we were able to use the net proceeds to take out our six and three-quarters percent senior notes due 2024 and redeem our five and a quarter percent notes due May 2023 providing significant annual interest savings. We also announced this morning that we recently closed on the sale of our assets in Channelview, Texas which includes our crude and condensate splitter for net proceeds of $58 million. Pro forma for the five and a quarter notes redemption and the sale of the Channelview assets we have about $2.1 billion of available liquidity. As Matt discussed, in early October we announced a $500 million share repurchase program. As of November 2nd, we have repurchased 4.5 million common shares representing about 2% of common shares outstanding for a total net cost of $74 million. Our long-term strategy to reduce leverage and simplify our capital structure is unchanged by our share repurchase program. Over the long term we are targeting leverage of three to four times on a consolidated basis. Over the last several months, we have received questions around our DevCo joint ventures and our strategy for repurchasing our interests in those assets. This morning we publish a slide in our earnings supplement and investor presentation that we hope is helpful and provides incremental clarity around the structure and the performance of the assets. If we assume that we repurchase the DevCo JVs in a single tranche in the first quarter of 2022, which is the representative scenario presented on slide 5 of the earnings supplement the repurchase price is between $900 million to $950 million is an estimate of five to six times multiple on asset EBITDA and the repurchase would be close to leverage neutral. Repurchasing the entirety of the DevCo in the first quarter of 2022 is our current base case assumption and we expect to have plenty of available liquidity to fund the full repurchase. We retain the flexibility to take out the DevCo in tranches and/or to change the timing of takeout but the base case assumption running through our plan is a full takeout at the low double digit fixed IRR in Q1, 2022 which again would be close to leverage neutral. Finally, I would like to echo Matt's comments that our business is performing very well across a difficult year and we are so proud of the exceptional performance of our entire Targa team. Given our performance and the actions that we have taken this year, we expect to exit 2022 in a strong position with a very bright outlook. And with that I'll turn the call back to Sanjay. 
Sanjay Lad: Great, we kindly ask that you limit the two questions and re-enter the Q&A line up if you have additional questions. Mitchell would you please open the lines for Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from a line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey good morning guys. This is James on for Jeremy. I hope you guys are doing well. I just wanted to start with the 2021 outlook and as it relates to 4Q obviously with all your growth projects mostly in service now, it seems in the gathering business volumes are kind of normalizing. Is 4Q kind of a good run rate for 2021? It seems there is some growth maybe on Grand Prix, but largely speaking do you think 4Q can be a good benchmark going forward?
Matt Meloy: Yes. Good morning. Yes, as we look at 2021, I think we're encouraged by the strong performance that we've seen in the back half of this year especially across our Permian footprint. So those volumes continue to be resilient, showing good growth this quarter and I think that sets us up well going into 2021. So we anticipate giving 2021 CapEx and EBITDA guidance in February. I think when you look across some of the pluses and minuses I think in this price environment we still see some growth in the Permian. You've got still strong producer activity on our system with higher GURs is going to set us up well, but we do have declines that are happening in the central area as well. So there is some, we need to get through the planning process and see how those kind of shake out as we get into 2021 but those are some of the pluses and minuses.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just shifting over to the recent upstream M&A, I just wanted to get your broader thoughts there in terms of implications to Targa and also if Targa would be interested in anything on the market at this point obviously you have a lot going on with the buybacks and deleveraging but if there's anything that you guys would consider going after here?
Matt Meloy: Sure. So yes I guess we'll handle that in two parts. First on the consolidation on the upstream, we have seen a lot of that. I'm going to hand it over to Robert Muraro our Chief Commercial Officer who kind of gives some perspective about how that may impact us.
Robert Muraro: This is Bob. So when we look at all the transactions that have happened recently and thinking about the parties that are doing, it's obviously different party by party. But, when you look at most of the transactions that have occurred we have great relationships on both sides of those tables and the consolidators, the buyers are people that we work with every day all day. So it's one of those things where we hate to see management teams go that we love, but the acquirers are ones we do a lot of work with that we have great relationships with as well. So we don't see a big detriment there and then as you start to think about those companies getting bigger as a general rule or tendency they tend to go with the guys on the midstream side that have more integrated platforms and a bigger balance sheet to work through the tough times and so we think that being directionally positive for us as the big guys start to rollout some of the smaller guys. Again we have great relationships with almost all of them that we've seen acquire and so we're excited about kind of what those integrations come, what comes from those integrations.
Matt Meloy: Yes. Well said Bob and then on the consolidation and what it looks like on the midstream side, I'd say for us we're really focused on our integrated platform, focusing our investment on organic growth. We're not lacking a key piece of the puzzle that we're really looking to bolt on or that would make Targa complete, we have an integrated platform. We have a really good Permian position and so we're in a strong position as we look forward multiple years really just servicing the existing assets and customers that we have. So we're going to be focused on organic growth. There is a pretty high hurdle for us to go look at something that would be a bolt on.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks for the color. In interest of time I'll leave it there. Thank you. 
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead. 
Christine Cho: Good morning. Maybe if I can follow up on that M&A question. Some of the combinations where there have been a couple of combinations where both the acquirer and Targa are notable customers on your system. How do we think about what the impact of that would be? Is the initial thought that the cost savings is going to enable more production with the same amount of spending or does the pro forma entity just pocket the savings and could there be other commercial opportunities as it relates to either new contracts or modifying existing ones?
Matt Meloy: Yes. I'd say as it relates to where they're both large customers of ours and to Bob's point we've had good relationships with really all parties involved there. I think it's going to have to play out overtime for, is there a change in how they're looking at, what their reinvestment is, how many rigs they're going to have on the acreage and how they're going to allocate capital. But, I think to Bobby's point is, over the longer term as these companies get larger flow assurance being connected to a scale, system like we have we think over the longer term is going to be beneficial. We don't see any real big impacts near term. It's going to be over the longer term how it plays out I think.
Christine Cho: I see, okay. And then just moving on to the DevCo buybacks, I understand this slide that you have there is illustrative. But, I do think that in your prepared remarks you mentioned that your base case is, divide all in one tranche in 22. Can you just talk about like you're thinking behind that buying it in one tranche versus buying it in pieces, and is the desire to buy it in one tranche because like the acquisition multiple is as a function of EBITDA is better the longer you wait or wanting it to be at least leverage neutral and you think that is best in 2022 or are there just other factors that we should be thinking about?
Jen Kneale: Sure Christine. This is Jen. I think there are a lot of factors that will go into our decision ultimately on how we take it out. That's the simplifying assumption that we're making which is that we take it out in a full single tranche in Q1 of 2022, which given our expectations for the performance of the assets is one that structure crosses over from where we would be repaying Stone Peak a multiple on invested capital versus an IRR. So we said in our prepared remarks that with that Q1, 2022 takeout assumption, you would be paying the fixed IRR on that takeout. So one that's a benefit to us. If we take it out earlier we would be paying multiple. If we wait longer, it's a lower cost to us ultimately as we take it out at that fixed IRR. So I think that that's an important element of our decision making. I think ultimately we'll see how the business performs through next year and if it makes sense for us to use some of our available free cash flow after dividends to take out a tranche or tranches early, then that's certainly an option. But, I think the point that we were trying to make with that slide and with our additional disclosures in our scripted remarks was that we could take it out in a single tranche in the first quarter of 2022, and given the strong EBITDA performance of those assets it's essentially a leverage neutral transaction. So it becomes much more a liquidity decision really than a leveraged decision and for us we expect to have significant liquidity over that horizon which is also what gives us that flexibility to be able to take out the full DevCo in a single tranche, if we wanted to. But again, we do have the flexibility to do it in pieces. We have the flexibility to wait longer and we have a lot of flexibility and that's one of the reasons that we liked the structure so much when we entered into the transaction with Stone Peak.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. That was helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. 
Michael Blum: Great. Good morning everyone. I wanted to go back to your comments. Your updated contracted G&P fee based cash flows. Just wanted to clarify, did you add a fee floor to your existing POP contracts are these actual conversions from POP to fee and then the other part of that question is kind of where is this all in the Permian or is it somewhere else?
Matt Meloy: Sure. Good morning Michael. Yes so for the G&P contract, I'd say it's a combination. It's largely in the Permian is where we're having, I'd say the most successful, we're continuing to invest for our customers and needing to protect the underlying investment. So in some cases it's adding a fee floor to contracts and others, as we look forward and get extensions and renewals and others where changing POPs and making it fee-based with POP or putting in floors for POP, it's a combo of all of those things and it depends on the customer relationship and what they prefer. We can be flexible on it. What we're really just trying to do is making sure we can protect. So, the underlying investment so we can continue to service our customers and hook up wells in the line.
Michael Blum: Okay, great. And then, second question I wanted to ask was just around asset sales. Obviously here you've got another one done. The question is are there any other meaningful potential asset divestitures that you could look at or do you think you've kind of exhausted that at this point?
Jen Kneale: There's nothing Michael that we're actively considering selling at this point-in-time. The one asset that you had visibility to previously because we spoke about it publicly what's the potential divestiture of our Midland crude business. After we announced that we had successfully sold the Delaware crude business. So, again there is an active process underway but that's at least an asset new type visibility to us considering selling before. Other than that, as we look across the asset portfolio, I wouldn’t say that there are any significant assets in particular to your specific question that we would consider selling at this point-in-time. But of course everything has to be on the table at all times so to the extent that we get any reverse enquiry around different asset or different positions. We would certainly consider those.
Michael Blum: Great. Thank you, very much.
Jen Kneale: Thanks, Michael.
Matt Meloy: Yes, thanks Michael.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Tristan Richardson with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Tristan Richardson: Hi, good morning. Really appreciate the comments on how the joint ventures could play out. I think that's helpful for all of us. Just a quick question. Thoughts on the Midland and just thinking about some of your customers talking about seeing some slight incremental growth next year. Towards your thoughts on the ramp of the relocated plants and to the extent if you remain highly utilized in the Midland, you could see CapEx next year perhaps exceed some of maybe your just general comments that you guys have made in the past about future CapEx.
Matt Meloy: Sure. I'd say in terms of the ramp and the volume, in the past when we brought on plants out in the Permian Midland really starting back with Joyce Johnson and Brooke. Now gateway, is and we bring an incremental plan on, it's typically pre-highly utilized fairly quickly. I think that would be our expectation with this current plant. We bring it on, it's going to be highly utilized. And we pointed to about $90 million of CapEx for this, that's going to for the most part almost all of it's going to be next year in 2021 with a little bit of spending this year. As you look forward to CapEx next year, we pointed this year to the low end around $700 million for this year. I would expect 2021 to be meaningfully less. Even with the addition of that Heim Plant, meaningfully less in 2021 than 2020. We're still working through the budgeting, working through what our producers sign with the compression and pipeline needs and that's going to be but I would expect this is even with the Heim Plant be meaningfully less than this year's CapEx.
Tristan Richardson: I appreciate it. And then, just thinking about the longer-term leverage target. I'm just balancing that between Targa's having been very active on the repurchase lately. Could we see repurchase become a regular fixture of the capital allocation. Whether that'd be targeted or programmatic over time or is the priority in the medium term to really prefund any DevCo scenario with free cash flow and added distributions.
Jen Kneale: Good morning, Tristan, this is Jen. I think for us, we really try to be very deliberate with the words that we used when we announced the share repurchase program. And really try to liken it to the opportunity that we saw earlier this year around being able to repurchase some of our debt. And what we saw were very attractive prices. For us this year, repurchase program is an opportunity in our view to benefit from what we perceive as a market dislocation. And so, as we look forward beyond the $500 million program that we announced. We'll be continuing to look at the best ways to return capital to our shareholders. We clearly are very much focused on the deleveraging plan and we don’t view the share repurchase program as a departure from that in any way shape or form. So, we will continue on that path to deleveraging. I think an important part of trying to articulate that deleveraging story was around the debt cost because it sounded like there were some broad market concerns that that was going to add significant incremental leverage to the target system. So, we try to provide clarity around that today, that we don’t view that as a departure either from that long-term deleveraging plan. I think ultimately we've made a lot of progress on a lot of strategic initiatives in term of adding fee based margin in the GMP business. In terms of rationalizing our capital spending, rationalizing costs et cetera. And I think all of that plus the strong operational performance of our assets this year has just provided us with a lot of flexibility. And so, hopefully we'll be able to continue to realize our flexibility as we look forward while continuing on that deleveraging path.
Tristan Richardson: I appreciate it Jen. Thank you guys, very much.
Matt Meloy: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Ujjwal Pradhan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ujjwal Pradhan: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to begin with the little part of your M&A commentary specific to midstream sector. Matt, so this year you have made good progress under recent cost while maintaining your significant operating leverage in the Permian. One could argue that you could achieve more of the same potentially to synergies from merger if you call transactions maybe in your core reasons and further expand that integrated profile. Have you or would you consider such opportunities?
Matt Meloy: Yes. I'd say we'll always consider and look at other opportunities that could make sense for us over the long-term. And could there be something with significant synergy potential which look attractive to us I guess theoretically. But when I think we feel pretty proud of our Permian position in our asset position. And so, if there was anything like that, MLE's or others, it would have to be very attractive for us to be issuing TRGP here for someone given our strong Permian position in our outlook. So, I guess any of those are not off the table, we're trying to be smart about all those things. Look at those things, we just feel like we're in a really good position without doing that trend any kind of transaction like that. And just execute on our business plan, focus on what we have in front of us. And it's going to deliver very good returns to our shareholders over time. And then announcing the share repurchase here recently, I think it's evident of how strong we feel about TRGP in our business outlook.
Ujjwal Pradhan: Thanks for that, Matt, very helpful. And my second follow-up is to your cons around potential asset sales in the future, appreciate all the comments you made earlier question. But as we think about your non-Permian GMP systems which are in basins with the material and declining profile. Could you maybe talk about the cash flow profile of some of those systems and made up in the market for such assets at the moment? Thank you.
Jen Kneale: I think to start, we're 1) very pleased that we were able to sell a 45% interest in our Bakken assets for $1.6 billion when we did. And I think that that transaction highlighted at least that point-in-time. Our willingness to really core up around what we consider sort of our bread and butter which is Permian through all of our downstream assets. But we do have other assets that I think also importantly bring a lot of additional benefits to us in terms of also brining volumes further through our downstream assets as well. So, really what you've seen as liquidated at this point are assets just haven’t in our view made sense for us to earn over the longer term and it made sense for somebody else to own. As we look across the cash flow profile, the assets that we have, again I think we're very comfortable with the Bakken exposure that we have right now. Those assets are continuing to perform well better in the third quarter than the second quarter. And better expectations as we look forward for those assets. I think on the Midland side, our teams have done a wonderful job of trying to extract savings from those assets and really optimized the positions that we have in trying to get more volume further through our downstream assets et cetera to make that more of an attractive cash flow profile than it would otherwise be. I think the moving of the Heim Plant highlights our engineering teams creativity to look around our asset footprints where we may have declining volumes and say is there a better higher use for certain assets. And that's a high visibility version of an asset moving. But we're looking all the time at the compression in one area that is less utilized they need to be moved to the Permian for example could be more highly utilized. So, hats off to our engineering and operations teams that are focused on that as well. I think ultimately we're very comfortable with the asset portfolio that we have. And ultimately we'll continue to look at whether we're the right long-term owner of assets. That's part of our job but again we're very comfortable with the assets that we have and the cash flow profile of those assets.
Ujjwal Pradhan: Got it, very helpful. Thank you, Jen.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Please go ahead.
Shneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning everyone. So, to go back to the DevCo. But just kind of wanted to understand a couple of things. But first, really appreciate the transparency in these slides that you've put out today. I'm trying to understand is your benefit in timing from acquiring the DevCo. It's sort I think about the IRR calculation and so forth in the fact that the distributions that get paid out as reducing that, you need to purchase, if I understand that correctly. What does the timing of ramping let's say a Grand Prix sort of changed here IRR thought process as to how the timing should be as. I was wondering if you could sort of walkthrough how the assets ramp. Does that change your timing on when you want to acquire the asset?
Jen Kneale: Shneur, this is Jen. I think that the EBITDA generation of assets is clearly a very important barrier for all that we're considering in when and makes sense to take out the structure and repurchase those interest. So, I think you're exactly right to the extent that those assets are performing very well which they are. And we've got good visibility I think to continued excellent performance from the assets that were included in the DevCo. Then we get to that sort of multiples of IRR calc change more quickly. And it makes more sense for us to potentially take it our earlier as a result of that. Everything that we put out this morning was just to try to provide a lot more clarity. One, its Stonepeak is benefiting from good quarter-over-quarter distribution as a result of the performance of those assets and so ultimately that reduces the overall end payment that we need to make to the important point that from our point-of-view it's not a significantly leveraging transaction in any way shape or form. It's again really more about liquidity than anything else. And ultimately I think that our continued strong performance across Targa is helping us to feel like we've got more flexibility to potentially move more quickly on taking out those DevCo interest. But a key element of the structure is definitely when it flips from that multiple to IRR and that's a key area both that we are considering when we thought about the base case that we were going to present today for one we are thinking about taking it on.
Shneur Gershuni: That makes perfect sense. So, I guess does that sort of drive also into your thought process around when you buy back your stock. As well also is it kind of like stock it at certain price and you sort of measure it again versus buying chunks of the DevCo. Is that kind of the way to be thinking about that as well also?
Jen Kneale: I think for us right now, clearly the share repurchase program is again a view on the market dislocation and so that's why we need quickly to put a program in early October and that's why you've seen us to be active under that program already. So, as we look forward, I think it's really the performance of our assets that reduce capital spending that has given us the flexibility to put in that share repurchase program and to already be successful repurchasing shares under it. And so, we'll be continuing to look each quarter what's the best use of our free cash flow, what's the best use of our liquidity. Positions us best for creating long-term shareholder value and we'll be making the decisions on what and when to repurchase and or to pay down on the debt side as a result of all of those variables.
Shneur Gershuni: Okay.
Matt Meloy: And just to add to that too. As Jen said earlier, our repurchasing of the debt, that was more about liquidity. So, it's not we need to do one at the expense of the other. We have enough liquidity to repurchase shares. We have enough liquidity to go on to repurchase DevCo's. So, when we repurchase the DevCo's, it's going to be leveraged neutral, maybe slightly leveraging but pretty much leverage neutral. So, one doesn’t go with the expense of the other necessarily.
Shneur Gershuni: Yes. That makes perfect sense. And I think given that you're obviously focused on getting leverage down and you see this kind of a leverage neutral transaction. I mean, do you see an opportunity if not finance more than 50% of it actually using that. Just sort of given the trajectory that you're on. Is that an option that you would consider at that time?
Jen Kneale: Our profile is significantly increasing free cash flow as we look out over the horizon. We also have a lot of liquidity. So, ultimately it would depend on that quarter how exactly we execute on whether it's drawn all under the revolver or we're using available free cash flow. I would expect it to be combination, Shneur.
Shneur Gershuni: Alright, perfect. Really appreciate the color today and I wish all a safe day.
Matt Meloy: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.
Colton Bean: Good morning. So Matt, just wanted to quickly clarify some of the comments there on 2021. I think you had previously steered towards a range of about $200 million on capital spend. Can you just clarify whether there was any consideration of processing CapEx in that number or if time would be fully incremental to that?
Matt Meloy: Sure. Yes, good morning Colton. For 2021, we gave a $200 million number that was in the kind of downturn in the second quarter. And it would it assumed a very kind of base level modest level of spending. Kind of the very I'd say downside case or low side case for that. And it did not have any incremental processing. So, the 90 would be incremental for that. Yes, as we're going through the budgeting and looking through what we expect for 2021, I would expect there to be more kind of base level spending relative to that 200 and then you'd add the $90 million of processing on top of that. Those are going to be right now it could be somewhere in between the 200 and 700. We do think it's going to be significantly less than the 700. So, I'm not trying to imply, we think it's going to be approaching that number at all. It's going to be significantly less than the 700. But I would expect it to be more than the 200.
Colton Bean: And you said it, and that's helpful. And then maybe a question for Scott. It looks like the TNF unit margins actually rebounded pretty strongly here back up close to Q1 levels despite lower volumes coming out of the mid count which I think is a little bit higher margin business. So, any specific drivers to point to on the margin improvement?
Scott Pryor: I think really for us when you look at the volumes that crossed our system. We have done a good job of contracting TNF across our entire system. Obviously led by production coming from our Permian Basin from our own GMP assets. I think that that was that's going to continue. You can see the ramp up that we've had fractionation side. They had been of or Train 7 earlier this year and now they added to the Train 8 in the latter part of the third quarter. Now, so we'll continue to see that. We do believe that our volumes are going to be up in the fourth quarter as we work across the inventory. So, I think overall, margins are still its highly competitive out there. But we've done a good job of really marketing our assets showing that we've got flexibility on our system. Then we can perform very well and reliable for our customers. So, I think that is going to continue to drive margins to our business not only on our Frac business, but our transportation on Grand Prix as well as it leads to the export business.
Colton Bean: Got it, I appreciate the time.
Matt Meloy: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of TJ Schultz with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
TJ Schultz: Hey. So, just a question had most of my follow-up on the DevCo. So, maybe just one clarification. Is that five to six times multiple reflective of run rate EBITDA at the beginning of 2022 or what period does that reflect? If that may give a sense of the ramp in those assets you're expecting in your base case assumption on timing. Thanks.
Jen Kneale: It's reflective of run rate EBITDA at that repurchase timing assumption TJ, so Q1 2022.
TJ Schultz: Okay great, thanks Jen.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Keith Stanley: Hi, thanks. First question on the LPG exports and the volumes you saw on the quarter. And I think you said you expected to be even higher in Q4. Should we think of that as mostly tied to greater long-term contracts with the facility expansion? Or is it partially better taking in some good short-term opportunities. Just curious if Q3 Q4 is a good run rate for LPG export.
Matt Meloy: So, when we look at the export business. Certainly, we had a very strong quarter averaging a 9.5 million barrels per month. We do expect the fourth quarter to be even stronger. We had a partial quarter on our phased and expansion which was inclusive of our new refrigeration unit at Galena Park at our export facility. So, getting the full benefit of a fourth quarter. We expect the volumes to be up as a result of that. With that said, also the additive of that phased and expansion we brought on new contracts. So, we are highly contracted, we expect the volumes to be stronger in the fourth quarter. The market is still has a strong demand for products across the globe with continued focus on the east. And so, we look at that and say well we're highly contracted. But we will continue to look for every opportunity to squeeze cargoes in between the contracted cargoes that we have and being very reliable to those term contracts and liftings that we have. But we'll look for every opportunity to optimize and in between those.
Keith Stanley: Thanks. And second question. Just to clarify, would you look to repay debt with free cash flow over the next couple of year? It's I don’t think the company has any debt maturities for several years. So, is that an option or is it more likely you could be building up cash for the eventual DevCo buying, thanks.
Jen Kneale: No Keith, to the extent that we've got maturities that are callable. For example, we could use available free cash flow to reduce the overall quantum of debt that we have by using that free cash flow to potentially call different series of notes. We also do expect some continuing spending and sort of the extent that we've got any liquidity drawn on the revolver which we currently do at small borrowings at both TRP and TRC. Then we'll be using available free cash flow to reduce debt at those revolvers as well which would just reduce again in the overall amount of debt that we have in our system.
Keith Stanley: Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Keith, thank you.
Operator: Your final question is from the line of Timm Schneider with Citi. Please go ahead.
Timm Schneider: Hey, thanks for all the color, guys. Just a real quick one follow-up on the LPG export side. You mentioned that east has been pretty strong. Just wondering what is driving that, who is your customer on the other side here as the trading house is this end users kind of also curious as to what you're seeing in Europe, in South America or your views as we kind of get into 2021.
Matt Meloy: Sure. When you look at the growth to the east, a lot of that growth is still driven by China and by India. And certainly when you look at China, there the continued growth and expected growth over the next several years is going to continue to be focused on PDH plants. Propane Dehydrogenation plants. In India, it's really more of a domestic queue. And as the state of India continues to really improve its infrastructure, there is still several billion people obviously in India and many of those are without an appropriate energy source. And so, the ability to put the infrastructure in place by other parties to get this clean burning source of fuel into India is really where we see a lot of growth. So, India and China are going to continue to be the primary source of growth that we see in the east. We've also seeing good demand in Europe, you mentioned that some of that comes more on the backs of refinery shut downs and the need in petrochemical plants where we've seen some movements in butane and other products. So again, global demand continues to grow. There is a need for a clean burning energy source which is propane and butane, much better than the use of coal or other solid waste material. So, we think the horizon looks very good for continued growth and a lot of that incremental demand is going to come from the U.S. where the production continues to climb.
Timm Schneider: Got it. Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Now we'll turn the call back over to Mr. Sanjay Lad.
Sanjay Lad: Great. Thanks to everyone that was on the call this morning. And we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. We will be available for any follow-up questions or any question is there. Thank you, and have a great day.
Operator: And this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-06 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Targa Resources Corporation Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today Mr. Sanjay Lad, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Sanjay Lad: Thanks, O'Shawna. Good morning, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call for Targa Resources Corp. The second quarter earnings release for Targa Resources along with the second quarter earnings supplement presentation are available on the Investors section of our website at targaresources.com. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. Statements made during this call that might, include Targa Resources' expectations or predictions, should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E at the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings. Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer; and Jen Kneale, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, the following senior management team members will be available for the Q&A session. Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Matt.
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay. During the second quarter, we navigated the challenges and impacts related to COVID-19 extremely well across our organization. We remain highly focused on employee safety, while efficiently operating our facilities. And have experienced no material impact to our operations. I would like to extend a thank you to all our employees for their continuous efforts to keep their colleagues and family safe. We appreciate all that you do on behalf of the Targa team, including delivering and maintaining first-class service to our customers. We had a strong second quarter, despite impacts from reduced demand and lower crude oil prices, which resulted in producers temporarily curtailing production and meaningfully reducing their activity levels. We have seen a quicker than anticipated rebound in prices and related producer activity, and forecasted activity for the remainder of 2020. Our overall Permian gathering and processing position performed well and our Midland system even showed sequential increase in the second quarter. This sets us up well for the second half of the year as we expect to benefit from stronger production across the Permian. We also benefited from our NGL storage position in the contango price structure, which existed for much of the second quarter. We expect to see those benefits show up in our margin throughout the remainder of the year. We made significant progress on reducing costs across Targa and expect to continue to benefit from these cost-reduction measures. And our free cash flow profile is improving and should continue to improve going forward, as our capital spending comes down and our cash flow remains strong. As we look forward, we are in a position where we expect to have the ability to capture growth volumes from the Permian without having to spend incremental CapEx on Grand Prix, fractionation or LPG export facilities, and we have excess processing capacity in the Delaware. This puts Targa in the position to delever and generate strong returns going forward. Now a bit more color on the shut-ins that occurred in the second quarter. On our previous earnings call, we estimated the potential impacts related to our producer customer shutting in production. We saw a trough in production across our G&P systems in May and these declines were consistent with our estimates of about a 10% reduction in the Permian due to shut-ins. In the Permian the impact was less pronounced across our Permian Midland system than our Permian Delaware system. We also experienced some declines in the Delaware, due to some third-party on-load gas coming off the system during the second quarter. Despite the temporary shut-in production and reduced activity levels quarterly inlet volumes across our aggregate Permian footprint declined only 1% sequentially. We have seen almost all volumes on our Midland and Delaware systems that were temporarily shut-in come back online. And we are continuing to see our volumes in Permian and Midland prove to be resilient. We are pleased to have our gateway plant online ahead of schedule, placing this asset in service early even through the challenges presented by COVID-19 is outstanding performance by our Targa team. With gateway online, we are currently processing volumes at higher levels than our March levels in the Permian Midland. The addition of gateway enhances our operational flexibility to move volumes across our system from other plants that we're running over nameplate. This allows us to enhance NGL recoveries and perform maintenance across our system footprint. Moving on to the Badlands. During May, we saw shut-in production impact our gas volumes by around 40%, which was at the high end of our previous estimate. Our gas volumes for July have since rebounded and are up significantly over the second quarter average. Across our Badlands crude system, we continue to have some production that remains shut in, but expect additional volumes to return as we continue to move through the third quarter. Turning to our Central region, which has already largely been decline, gas inlet volumes in the second quarter declined 15% sequentially, primarily driven by greater-than-expected shut-in production on our South Oak system and we also had some on-load gas expire. Despite the historically low commodity price environment, the durability of our G&P segment margin has strengthened as we have reduced our commodity exposure by adding fees and fee floors to our G&P contracts. The financial performance of our G&P segment is now more driven by volume throughput and fees as opposed to direct commodity prices, which is evidenced in our year-to-date results and will serve us well going forward. With fee floors, we also will benefit as prices begin to rise. Shifting to our logistics and transportation segment. Throughput volumes on our Grand Prix pipeline and at our fractionation complex in Mont Belvieu were slightly lower sequentially as a result of lower inlet volumes from production shut-ins and reduced activity across our G&P systems. But now with most of the shut-in production back online and the recent start-up of our gateway plant, we are currently seeing higher volumes through Grand Prix and our fractionation assets. We remain on track to bring Frac Train 8 online later in the third quarter as well as our Grand Prix extension in the Central Oklahoma in the first quarter of 2021, where it will connect with William's new Bluestem pipeline. Our LPG export services business at Galena Park continued to perform well during the second quarter. Sequentially volumes during the second quarter were slightly lower as a result of scheduled downtime to tie in the phase expansion at our LPG export facility. We recently completed our Galena Park expansion in early August and expect our LPG export volumes to be higher in the second half of this year as we are highly contracted for the balance of the year and beyond. While the majority of shut-in production has returned and activity levels begin to pick back up, there remains a level of uncertainty for the second half of 2020 around the pace of demand and commodity price recovery due to COVID-19. However, our assets are performing very well. And given we are more than six months through the year and have more visibility today than we had back in March, April or May, we are revising the bottom end of our estimated full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA range higher and the updated range is now $1.5 billion to $1.625 billion. Spending related to our announced major capital project is largely complete and Targa is well positioned to meaningfully benefit as business conditions strengthen. With our best-in-class Permian supply position, driving increasing volumes through our integrated midstream system. We remain focused on continued capital and operating cost discipline and combined with the strategic measures we executed earlier this year, we expect to generate positive free cash flow after dividends in the second half of 2020 based on our revised full year adjusted EBITDA estimate. While there may be some uncertainty in global commodity markets related to the coronavirus and other macro factors there is strength in what we can see for Targa's core business, positioning us exceptionally well for the longer term. With that I'll now turn the call over to Jen to discuss Targa's results for the second quarter and other finance-related matters.
Jen Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $351 million. As Matt discussed, our results for the second quarter were impacted by the low commodity price environment and temporary production curtailments and reduced producer activity which resulted in lower volumes across our Gathering and Processing and logistics and transportation systems offset by our significant efforts to reduce costs. In our logistics and transportation segment, while second quarter Grand Prix, fractionation and LPG export volumes were modestly lower, when compared to the first quarter, the sequential decline in segment operating margin was driven by lower marketing and other. Seasonality in our wholesale marketing businesses, combined with less optimization margin realized in our marketing businesses during the second quarter, accounted for about half of the sequential decline in segment operating margin. We are very proud of the entire Targa organization's efforts to manage operating and general and administrative expenses lower. As we said on our second quarter call, we expected to have aggregate operating and G&A expense savings of approximately $100 million relative to our plan and we now expect to meaningfully exceed $100 million in 2020. Looking forward, quarterly operating expenses in each segment are estimated to be modestly higher in the third and fourth quarters when compared to the second quarter, as new facilities begin operations in both our G&P and L&T segments. Turning to hedging. Based on a range of current estimates of producer customer activity levels, we remain substantially hedged for 2020. We have hedged approximately 85% to 95% of natural gas, approximately 80% to 90% of condensate and approximately 75% to 85% of NGLs. Supplemental hedge disclosures including 2021 hedge percentages by commodity can be found in our earnings and supplement presentation on our website. Related to counterparty risk, we have had no material credit losses and remain focused on monitoring and managing our credit exposure. We have a large diversified customer base across our operating businesses, which includes large integrated customers, other investment-grade counterparties and customers that are required to provide credit protection. Our 2020 net growth CapEx estimate range remains between $700 million to $800 million and our 2020 net maintenance CapEx estimate continues to be approximately $130 million. We have spent about $400 million of net growth CapEx through the first two quarters with growth CapEx spending expected to continue to trend lower as we move through the second half of the year with free cash flow increasing. We had over $2.1 billion of available liquidity as of June 30 and have no near-term maturities of senior notes or credit facilities with the earliest maturity occurring in May 2023. On a debt compliance basis TRC's leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was approximately 4.1 times versus a compliance covenant of 5.5 times. Our consolidated reported debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 4.9 times. With our premier integrated asset position and our talented employees Targa is well positioned for the longer term. As business fundamentals improve, we expect to generate increasing free cash flow after dividends that will be available to reduce debt and further strengthen our balance sheet profile. Our business is performing very well across a difficult year and we are so proud of the exceptional performance of our employees. Given the actions that we have taken and will continue to take this year, we expect to exit 2020 in a strong position with increasing flexibility. Lastly, before we turn the call over to Q&A, we wanted to provide an update that we are on track to publish our 2019 sustainability report during the third quarter and will include enhanced disclosures around our framework of policies, practices and systems in the areas of safety, environmental, social and governance. And with that operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] 
Sanjay Lad: And we kindly ask that you limit to two questions and reenter the Q&A line up if you have additional questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, guys. This is James [ph] on for Jeremy. Maybe I could start off with a two-part question on the logistics side of the business. Your Grand Prix volumes looked pretty resilient during the quarter, I assume better than what you guys had originally anticipated. But just through July, what are you guys seeing on that pipeline? And maybe relative to 1Q volumes, if you can – or do you expect to surpass that level in 3Q and then the cadence in the 4Q? And then the second part is just looking out at 2021 I understand, it's very early but just with the dock expansion now online, do you see the business mix shifting to the logistics side in 2021 versus 2020 or historically?
Matt Meloy: Good morning. Yes, I'll answer the first one just about Grand Prix and then go to the other one. Yes, the Grand Prix volumes we are seeing some strength. I'd say with gateway coming on and just the resilience that we're seeing in the Permian. With that plant coming on volumes are continuing to ramp. I'd say we've been pleasantly surprised with how that assets performed, the volumes going through it and our ability to enhance recoveries across that asset and the rest of our Permian footprint is going to continue to drive better recoveries going forward. So on a recovery basis, I think we feel good about the outlook for moving those volumes down Grand Prix and just from the overall volume uplift we're going to get from putting gateway on. Both of those things are going to drive more volumes on Grand Prix. So I think it's kind of happening real-time, as we're ramping up gateway. But I think we're pretty optimistic about the volume profile for gateway through the back half of the year and then into 2021. Now in terms of business mix and how that's shifting, yes, I'd say with Grand Prix going to continue to ramp volumes fractionation export and the investments we made on the downstream side. I would say that over time, partially dependent on commodity prices. But yes, we see more of the business mix shifting to downstream in terms of percentage operating margin than G&P. But we expect to have really growth in both areas over time.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for the color. And then just my second question, I'm just looking at Slide 29 in the updated presentation this morning. And just looking at the South Texas footprint, obviously look there's a few less rigs there from your last kind of slide presentation not surprisingly but just asking for an update on maybe Sanchez's activity on the footprint and how it's progressing with your expectations?
Matt Meloy: Sure. On the South Texas footprint really amongst the whole Eagle Ford, there's not a lot of activity out there. We actually didn't see a whole lot of volume shut in on that system but there's just really not a lot of activity. So you've seen volumes move down. We are getting some indications from producers that some activity could start picking up here. So there remains an opportunity for kind of stemming the decline and maybe going the other way here as we kind of get into the back half of the year. But we really haven't seen a lot of progress made in terms of volumes here recently. But there is some – there is some opportunity for those volumes to perform a little bit better as we go forward.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks for the questions.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson with Truist Securities.
Tristan Richardson: Hi. Good morning guys. I really appreciate all the comments you've given around what you're seeing in the second half or volumes. I mean, I guess kind of taking that commentary -- some of the commentary from your large customers about reinvestment rates, and then balancing in some natural decline in some of the other basins. Can you talk a little bit about exit rates for the year, now that curtailed volumes are back to exit rates look to be above 2Q and more in line with what you're seeing in July or August, or is decline comes in do we start to get back to more what you saw in 2Q?
Matt Meloy: I'd say, for that we're -- we've had good discussions with our producers. And we're getting more visibility around their plans for 2020. So I'd say in the incremental data points, we're getting there continue to be more and more positive in more and more conversations we have. So it would be our expectation that, out in the Permian that from here would not surprise me if we had some growth, from where we are today, through the end of the year, in the Permian. We still have a range in our EBITDA guidance, because it's still -- there's still certainly some uncertainty there. But I'd say the most recent data points, we're getting are more supportive, of having really growth from this point going forward in the Permian.
Tristan Richardson: That's great. Thanks, Matt. And then, just on the cost side of things. Jen, you talked about some of the $100 million of incremental versus expectations. I mean certainly, new assets coming online in the second half we'll see some ramp, but curious about just sort of the concept of cost reduction permanence, as you look out into 2021 and beyond?
Jen Kneale: I think, Tristan that we've done an excellent job of taking costs out really across the board. The focus of our organization whether it be, supply chain every operations person every group involved in G&A savings. It's just been a really remarkable effort, when we compare that $100 million of cost savings which we now expect to be, that's relative to our plan as we approach this year. And so I think that, we see good permanence from a lot of those cost savings partially because our expectations are that activity levels may be reduced versus where we were before. So our need to hire additional personnel and things like that. Some of that I expect will be permanent in terms of cost savings. Our management of other operating costs around production, we are doing a very good job of managing those with each and every supplier and we'll continue to be focused on that. But as we see volumes increase across our systems, those costs may be a little bit harder to maintain the Permian of. But we're working very diligently to try to do that.
Tristan Richardson: It's great. Thank you guys very much.
Matt Meloy: Hey thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christine Cho with Barclays.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is Mark on for Christine. So Permian volumes held up better than what we would have thought and better than some of your peers. Could you just talk through, what were the potential drivers of that? Did your customers just have better storage positions or sales agreements on the crude side, that enable them to keep falling, or were there other factors that played a part and just the impact from less shut-in?
Matt Meloy: I think, we continue to just see the resiliency of our Permian Midland system. When we add plants there are more volumes that usually come in to fill those up relatively quickly. If there's other wells that are being shut in maybe it lower some pressures and we see it come from other parts of the system. So I think we benefit from just having a really large footprint on the Permian Midland side, with really high-quality, well capitalized good producers as well. So I would say on average we would expect them to outperform the Basin. And we've seen that continue to prove out. So I think it's a combination of a number of factors. I think it's the footprint system we have, but it's also the really strong producers we have behind our systems.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And then recognizing things are still pretty dynamic on the producer side. But just how should we think about CapEx for next year? Last quarter I think you gave a rough estimate for about $200 million in growth CapEx, but with activity holding up better across your acreage, should we still think that's a good number?
Matt Meloy: Yeah. So for CapEx as we look forward if you look through the remainder of this year really the most of the large capital projects are coming on and going to be completed this year, adding the fractionation trains, export facilities and processing plants. As you look out into 2021, we have the completion of our Grand Prix extension up into Oklahoma in the first quarter but we don't have any large-scale projects announced to come online in 2021. So we'd expect that CapEx, when you look to our recent history to be much lower than the amount we've spent over the previous several years. We have capacity on Grand Prix. So as volumes ramp we'll be able to just move those volumes down Grand Prix. We have capacity in our fractionation and export. So we're really set up pretty well to be able to capture some growth volumes. Whether it's in 2021 or 2022, going forward to capture those growth volumes, with really not much more incremental investment on the downstream side of the business. So then it's on the G&P side where we'll have a regular field and compression and other spending we'll need to have to gather those volumes to the plants. And as I noted in my comments is we have excess capacity in the Delaware side. So with Peregrine coming on, we do have processing out there. So it really comes to on the G&P side. I'd say the next processing plant we have visibility to if there is some growth is again in the Permian Midland where we've seen strength. So it would be a processing plant on the Permian Midland side, which depending on how volumes move as we go through the remainder of this year there could be a need for another plant out there. And we're already trying to be even more capital efficient with the way we do that. So we're looking internally is there a potential plant we could move from another area that's underutilized. Repurpose that and move it out into the Permian Midland when and if it's needed out there. And so we're already looking at that. And if we do that and be significantly less capital than a new build get-out capital that we've had for the recent $250 million day plants we put in.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. That’s helpful. Thanks.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colton Bean with Tudor Pickering Holt.
Colton Bean: Good morning. So, maybe just a follow-up on the capital question there with a slightly longer-dated lens. I think we've seen a few of the large Permian producers highlighted growth cap even in the event of a much higher oil price. So, obviously, still a long way out, but do you see next year's capital budget as a decent marker for 22-plus if growth was in line with that mid- single-digit type commentary?
Matt Meloy: I'd say as we look out over multi-years, what we see is the addition of processing plants likely just going to be in the Permian. On the Midland side likely there’ll be more plants there than the Delaware just kind of given where current volumes are relative to capacity. So it's putting in a processing plant on the Permian side shouldn't need much more capital on Grand Prix as we have capacity on that pipe. It will be just adding some pumps, but those are relatively small amounts of capital. And then is when we're going to need another fractionator after Train 8. So part of it will be the timing of what that growth looks like in 2021 and when we'll need to green light Train 9 on the fractionation. And does that fall into 2022 -- does it fall into 2020? When do we need that? How much growth is there in 2021 and 2022? But it's going to average out, one year we might be putting one in and other year we may not right? So it's going to depend on when we put in those processing plants and fractionation facilities.
Colton Bean: Got it. And then just on the NGL marketing downtick, I understand the wholesale seasonality. Can you speak to the optimization side of that? And how do you expect that to play out through the back half of the year?
Matt Meloy: Sure. So we had -- if you look sequentially our marketing margin was down in the second quarter versus the first. We pointed to our wholesale marketing, which is normal seasonality that we had every year in that business. But we also -- it was actually a relatively good quarter for us on the NGL marketing front. But the margin really won't be realized until later quarters as there was significant contango on some of the NGL products. We're able to purchase store put into storage and we'll realize those margins as we go forward. So we factor that into our updated guidance. And so we'll reap those benefits as we realize those contango trades.
Colton Bean: Great. I appreciate that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kyle May with Capital One Securities.
Kyle May: Good morning. I appreciate still a lot of uncertainty ahead. But just wondering if you can talk about some of the different factors that could put you at one end or the other of your revised guidance for this year?
Matt Meloy: Sure. At this point in the year it really is less about I'd say commodity prices. We gave commodity prices with our updated guidance. But given our hedge position and our fee base positionm it is less about commodity prices and it really is more about volumes. So we've had positive signs from the producers in the Permian. Let's see how that plays out through the rest of the year. So I think there's still some potential variability in what the volumes look like for the Permian from now to the rest of the year. And then we also still have some shut-ins up in the Badlands and we have some shut-ins in the South Oak segment. And so there are some signs that those are going to be coming on. When those come on, do they fully come back on? That's another variable. So to be the return of shut-in production in our Central region combined with Permian volumes and what the growth profile looks like from now to the end of the year.
Jen Kneale: I think, Kyle there's also uncertainty around COVID as we all know. And so we're also being conservative factoring what we don't know into account. So we've got great visibility, I think from our producers or certainly increased visibility versus where we were for back half of the year performance, which gives us a lot of confidence when we think about the strength and resiliency of our footprint. But there is just continued uncertainty around COVID. And so we're trying to factor some of that conservatism in as well.
Kyle May: Got it. That's very helpful. And as my follow-up, it seems like we've seen a little bit more stability in the last month or so. And wanted to get your latest thoughts around the M&A landscape and if you see any opportunity for Targa to make any changes that could improve the balance sheet?
Matt Meloy: Yeah. So our focus and we mentioned it in our script multiple times is really on free cash flow after dividends and wanting to delever. We have a lot of really good organic projects adding -- picking up volumes through our Midland system, our Delaware system picking up the transport frac and export as we move the molecule downstream those are going to be really good returns for us. So our focus really is on -- if there's spending to do it's on organic spending in and around our footprint for our existing customers and add-on customers in and around our footprint. That is going to be our focus right now because our leverage is headed in the right direction, but we still want our leverage to move even lower.
Kyle May: Got it. Thanks a lot.
A – Matt Meloy: Thank you.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global.
Sunil Sibal : Hi. Good morning, everybody and hope everybody is safe. So first bookkeeping question for me. So it seems like when I look at the equity earnings for the non-controlling interest about $96 million and then another $13 million or of DD&A. So it seems like that was a drag of about $110 million on EBITDA for the quarter. So I was just curious was there any kind of onetime item in there which impacted that number, or is that kind of a run rate kind of a number? Obviously, some assets are ramping up?
Jen Kneale : We can dig into it some more and come back to you, but I don't believe there was anything that I'd characterize as onetime in nature there, Sunil.
A – Matt Meloy: That's right. And maybe just to support Jen, Sunil. I think if you look to fourth quarter -- first quarter 2019, '20 and then the current quarter here the non-controlling interest cutback the EBITDA has been around kind of $100 million, $110 million. That was consistent last quarter as well. If you adjust for the impairment and DD&A.
Sunil Sibal : Okay. Got it. And then on the fractionation side understand that Q2 numbers had some noise in there. But now you're bringing on another fraction withdrawals online. So I was just kind of curious how should we be thinking about the volumes there? When would you expect those -- your full fractionation capacity to be kind of 80% or so utilized? Any thoughts there?
A – Matt Meloy: Yes. So right now, we have excess fractionation capacity. And then Train eight is going to be coming online. But again, with bringing on gateway we have been able to enhance our recoveries out in the Permian and do some maintenance and other things we would expect more NGLs from here going forward. And some growth in the Permian and from our third-party customers as those contracts kick in and ramp up over time.  So we still have a positive outlook for being able to utilize our fractionation capacity. But the timing of when it will be full and when we'll need another fractionation facility it really will depend on, as we kind of exit 2020 what the growth outlook is from our producer customers in 2021 and beyond. We're really just now kind of getting some of those indications from our customers. We don't have nearly as many data points for 2021 and beyond as we do for 2020. But I will say the early indications from some of our producer customers have been positive, I'd say relative to maybe our expectations even just a few weeks or a few months ago. So we are seeing positive indications for 2021 and beyond but it's still pretty early. To give you kind of a firm timeline there.
Sunil Sibal : Okay. Got it. Thanks for all the color guys.
A – Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: There are no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Sanjay Lad for closing remarks.
Sanjay Lad: Thank you, Hope. Well thank everyone that was on the call this morning and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. We will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now all disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-07 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Targa Resources First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to Sanjay Lad, Senior Director of Finance and Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Sanjay Lad: Thank you, Bridget. Good morning, and welcome to the First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call for Targa Resources Corp. The first quarter earnings release for Targa Resources, along with the first quarter earnings supplement presentation are available on the Investors section of our website at targaresources.com. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include Targa Resources' expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings.  Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer; and Jen Kneale, Chief Financial Officer. We will also have the following senior management team members available for Q&A.: Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer.  And with that, I will now turn the call over to Matt.
Matthew Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay. Good morning, and thank you to everyone for joining. On behalf of the Targa team, we hope that you and your families are doing well and staying safe.  The first quarter results show that our assets continue to perform well with solid operational and financial performance in the first quarter. We had $428 million of adjusted EBITDA, 32% growth in Permian volumes, 37% growth in fractionation volumes and 26% growth in export volumes versus last year despite significantly lower commodity prices. Our continued efforts to reduce commodity exposure across our G&P business by adding fees and fee floors allowed us to generate higher operating margin even as prices fell significantly. The financial performance of our G&P segment is now more driven by volume throughput and fees as opposed to direct commodity prices, which will serve us well going forward. With some of our fee-based contracts through our fee-floor structure, we will also benefit as prices begin to rise.  Now moving on to the impacts of COVID-19. When it became clear that the pandemic was a significant risk to our employees and their families, we moved quickly to make sure that we took care of our employees, our facilities and our customers. We swiftly implemented important safety measures, including providing our employees with protective equipment and we are currently pleased with the minimal direct impact that the virus has had on our employees. I'd now like to thank all of our employees. We are especially proud of our frontline employees in the field who continue to safely and effectively operate our facilities every day. And thanks to our other employees who are operating at a high level of effectiveness, working remotely to ensure continued first-class service to our customers.  Our industry continues to navigate through an unprecedented period as a result of COVID-19. The low demand and low crude oil price environments driving producers to meaningfully reduce their activity levels and even curtail current production. Given this lower volume outlook and increased uncertainty about business fundamentals, we moved quickly and decisively as an organization to take some key actions to protect our balance sheet and position Targa to be successful over the long term. On March 18, we announced the market a 90% reduction in Targa's common dividend payout. This reduction provides approximately $755 million of additional annual direct cash flow resulting in significant free cash flow available to reduce debt. Additionally, we also announced meaningful reductions to our 2020 and 2021 net growth capital spending estimates. Since then, we have further reduced our 2020 net growth CapEx estimate to a range that is now between $700 million and $800 million, which now represents a 40% reduction at the midpoint relative to our initial 2020 guidance. We continue to identify and execute other measures to best position Targa over the long term, given lower expected growth and related business activity. In aggregate, we now expect our estimated 2020 operating and general and administrative expenses to be lower by at least $100 million versus prior expectations. Some of the additional measures that we have taken include reductions in compensation, benefits and our workforce across the Targa organization, including Targa executive management reduced their 2020 salaries by 10% to 15%, resulting in a reduction to their expected total cash compensation of approximately 40% compared to last year and based on our current forecast.  Targa's Board of Directors reduced their 2020 cash compensation by 10%. We reduced our workforce by 8% in late April. And we further eliminated new positions -- new open positions expected in the growth environment of our initial 2020 budget. We are also highly focused on tightly managing every line item in our operating and G&A expense budgets and are currently estimating significantly lower utilities, chemicals, lube oils and ad valorem taxes, among others. We will continue to be focused on capital and operating cost discipline as we work through the current environment.  Turning to our business segments. Let's talk about the production that we're currently seeing across our gathering and processing systems. We continue to have a lot of discussions with our producers regarding their plans for near term production, and those discussions remain very fluid. We have seen shut-ins of older wells and shut-ins of newer wells. Each producer is driven by different factors unique to their economic interests and their outlook. We have experienced shut-ins across each of our gathering and processing regions for the month of April, but only to a small degree so far. For example, our volumes in the Permian in April were approximately flat to the first quarter, so we have not seen a material impact from shut-ins yet.  We do, however, expect more volumes to be shut in for May. And while there is still significant uncertainty given our latest producer discussions and given what we're seeing on our systems today, beginning in May, we are estimating shut-in volumes of approximately 10% across our aggregate Permian region. In our central region, we are also estimating shut-in volumes of approximately 10%. And in the Badlands, we estimate about 30% to 40% of gas and approximately 20% of crude oil to be shut in. These shut-ins will result in lower NGL supply through Grand Prix and through our fractionation trains in Mont Belvieu. However, as a potential economic mitigant, Targa has one of the leading NGL storage positions in Mont Belvieu. This storage position is highly valuable in this environment and allows us an opportunity to benefit from the dynamics in the NGL market.  And our LPG export business at Galena Park continues to perform well and we remain on track to complete the expansion of our export facility at Galena Park in the third quarter. We remain highly contracted for the rest of the year.  It was only a few months ago that we reported a record fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings and discussed our strong business outlook. And as we've already discussed since then, business fundamentals have changed drastically. We believe that Targa is well positioned to navigate through this period of weak market fundamentals, even in an environment with protracted producer shut-ins. We have a strong liquidity position and have taken actions to protect our balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility, generating free cash flow after dividends to reduce debt looking forward.  The world continues to work through the impacts of this COVID-19, creating significant variability around expectations for demand for commodities. As you may have read in our press release this morning, given the uncertainties in this environment, we are updating our full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA estimate to $1.40 billion to $1.625 billion and withdrawing our previously disclosed full year 2020 operational expectations.  We would like to share what we see as a reasonable range of expected outcomes and some color around detailed downside cases that we ran internally. For example, we ran a downside case, which assumes 30% production shut-ins for the remainder of the year in the Permian Basin, and in that scenario, we believe we would generate somewhere around $1.4 billion of full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA. Based on recent producer dialogue, we currently don't expect that negative production case to occur, but rather some lesser amount of volume shut-ins for a duration of a couple to several months. So we believe an expectation of full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA of around $1.40 billion to $1.625 billion, depending on production levels, covers a reasonable range of potential outcomes. But remember, our results are driven by our producer customers across our G&P operating regions, and there remains significant uncertainty around the potential extent and duration of estimated shut-ins.  Lastly, despite the uncertainty of the current environment, based on the strength of our premier integrated asset position and our employees, Targa is poised to benefit when business fundamentals improve, positioning us exceptionally well for the longer term.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Jen to discuss Targa's results for the first quarter and other finance-related matters.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $428 million. Our performance during the first quarter was driven by strong volumes across our Permian and Badlands G&P systems combined with strong asset performance through our integrated downstream value chain of NGL transportation, fractionation and LPG export services. We recently commenced operations on our new Frac Train 7 in Mont Belvieu and completed our new Peregrine gas plant in Permian Delaware. We remain on track to complete our remaining major growth capital projects underway this year, which means we will be well positioned to benefit when activity levels increase. Considering current market conditions in the low commodity price environment, during the first quarter, we recognized an approximate $2.4 billion noncash impairment charge. The impairment is primarily associated with the partial impairment of gas processing facilities and gathering systems associated with our mid-continent G&P operations and full impairment of our coastal G&P operations.  Turning to hedging. Based on a range of current estimates of producer customer activity levels, we remain substantially hedged for 2020. We have hedged approximately 85% to 100% of natural gas, approximately 75% to 100% of condensate and approximately 65% to 80% of NGL. Supplemental hedge disclosures, including 2021 hedge percentages by commodity, can be found in our earnings supplement presentation on our website. We continue to closely monitor and manage our credit exposure. We have a large diversified customer base across our operating businesses, which includes large integrated customers and other investment-grade counterparties.  Approximately 75% of the revenue from our top 25 customers is from investment-grade counterparties or from customers which provide credit protections. We currently do not anticipate any material credit losses as we are largely in a net payable position in our G&P contracts. And in our downstream businesses, our counterparties are largely either investment-grade or otherwise are required to provide credit protections to secure their commercial arrangements. As Matt described, our 2020 net growth CapEx estimate has been further reduced to now be between $700 million to $800 million. Additionally, we have reduced our 2020 net maintenance CapEx estimate to approximately $130 million.  In April, we extended our accounts receivable facility to April 2021 and reduced our facility commitment size from $400 million to $250 million, to minimize commitment fees, given our expectations for lower activity levels and commodity prices. During the first quarter and through early April, we repurchased a portion of outstanding senior TRP notes on the open market paying approximately $240 million plus accrued interest to repurchase approximately $300 million of notes, which provides approximately $12 million in annual interest savings. We had approximately $2.4 billion of available liquidity as of March 31 and have no near-term maturities of senior notes or credit facilities, with the earliest maturity occurring in 2023.  On a debt compliance basis, TRP's leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was approximately 4.1x versus a compliance covenant of 5.5x. Our consolidated reported debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 5.1x.  To echo Matt's earlier statements, we believe that with the collective actions we have proactively taken to protect our balance sheet and strengthen our financial flexibility, Targa is well positioned for the long term.  And with that, operator, please open the lineup for questions.
Sanjay Lad: [Operator Instructions]. Bridget, can you please open the line to Q&A, please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Christine Cho with Barclays.
Christine Cho: Thank you for all the color. I just wanted to maybe touch upon the conversations that you're having with producers. Can you just give us some more color on what those conversations are like? And also recognizing that you have some large customers that are public, I would also be curious as to how the conversations with the smaller and private guys are going.
Matthew Meloy: Sure. Yes, I'd characterize our producer conversation, as I kind of said in the script, very fluid. I'd say even just a few weeks or even a month ago, some producers were giving us estimates for what they believe they were going to shut-in. And this ranges across our systems, really large and small. And we've seen them shut some in only, maybe even a few days or weeks later to come back up and then shut-in a different amount. So we've seen variability even among some producers about what they're going to do and how they're going to execute their shut-in plan. And we've seen others say, we're getting ready to, here's what we're going to do, and we've even seen those plans change. So I'd say producers right now are trying to work through what best makes sense for them. And oil prices are moving around very quickly as well. So they're trying to best balance their downstream needs and obligations versus current prices, and where they're in kind of constant dialogue with them trying to figure out how best to make sure that we can handle the volume.
Christine Cho: Would you say the conversations are different for the private guys because they're downstream constraints or downstream commitments might be different?
Matthew Meloy: I'd say, really, and just when the management team here is talking to each one of our different leaders in the business segment, it really just more varies producer by producer. I don't know if I could aggregate that the publics are doing one thing versus the privates. I mean, there's significant variability across system, across region. Some producers have acreage positions in multiple basins and how they're acting in one basin versus another versus a producer who might be acting one way because their production is all in one basin, can be very different, even amongst the same basin. So I think it varies more unique to their acreage position and their economic situation as opposed to whether they're the publics or the privates or small or large.
Christine Cho: Okay. Very helpful. And then you brought on a frac, and another one is set to come on later this year. Some of your peers have deferred the timing of their frac. So wondering if you're expecting more third parties to offload into your plans this year or next year? Or alternatively, were there volumes that you were expecting to move over to third-party plans that are maybe not happening under the scheduled time frame?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. I'd say, when it comes to our fracs, we are planning on completing we're -- significant progress on Train 8. So we do plan to complete that. And I think you're right, there are some others who have either slowed down or canceled some of their fracs. So when volumes begin to grow, if they're in a position where they would need some frac capacity, there is that potential. We would welcome that opportunity. What we're looking at for 2020, I don't know that we would see a lot of that opportunity, but as we go out, certainly, that opportunity could present itself.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni with UBS.
Shneur Gershuni: I just wanted to start off by following up on the frac conversation. When I think about Frac 8 coming online, if it's the volumes that come into your system end up being below the capacity of your entire frac footprint, are there opportunities to optimize by shutting down an older inefficient frac temporarily and moving the volumes to the newer fracs? What if kind of the partial ownership sort of limit that opportunity from a margin perspective?
Scott Pryor: Shneur, this is Scott Pryor. We definitely look at our entire fractionation facility as a whole. But we will operate those based upon what is most efficient, what is based upon the economics of the inflow of volumes as well as the outflow of volumes needed to fulfill customer contracts. Again, both on the inbound side as well as the outbound side. As we supply customers downstream of that, as we supply export volumes from both propane and butane, we certainly look at it from an optimization perspective. And there's a variety of factors that flow through those analyses, but we are certainly looking at it to optimize what is most efficient and is -- what benefits us from an economic perspective.
Shneur Gershuni: Okay. That makes great sense. And maybe to follow-up on the G&P side. I definitely appreciated all the color that you gave about shut-ins and so forth. I was wondering if you can just give a little bit of color about what your underlying decline rate is for your Permian footprint. And how easy is it to bring shut-in wells back? Is it costly? Or is it something that's pretty straightforward across your footprint?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. Good. Good question there on the shut-ins. We've had, I'd say, extensive conversations with our producers about that. So as we're trying to forecast when there's going to be shut-ins, what should we expect when it comes back. So again, we can be ready. I'd say for the most part, in those producer discussions, they feel like most of that production when they shut-in, we'll be able to bring it back without damaging the reservoir. Could there be some older, really low rate vertical wells and some things which they shut-in and just don't bring back? I think there could be some amount of those as well. But I think for the most part, we'd expect the shut-in volumes to come back and perform well when those volumes do come back. As far as the decline rates, that's tough. I don't have a crisp answer for you on that. I mean, it would be by system. Obviously, there's been a lot of growth in the Permian. So we have newer vintage on average production there where some of our older systems who haven't been growing as much. So it would be steeper there.
Shneur Gershuni: Okay. That makes sense. And just one final question. I was surprised to see how much you've been able to repurchase debt in the open market. Do you expect to continue to do so if the opportunities present itself, i.e. the debt trades below par? Or have we seen the sale end of that?
Jennifer Kneale: Shneur, this is Jen. I think, ultimately, it depends on opportunities that the market presents to us. And so we saw the opportunity when our debt started trading at a deep discount in early March to repurchase notes at a very attractive rate made all the sense in the world in terms of interest savings while also reducing our overall leverage. If we get that opportunity in the future, we'll certainly look to utilize some of our available liquidity to continue to execute on that, but ultimately, it just depends on the market opportunity.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.
Michael Blum: So I apologize for harping on the fracs and all that. But I guess, maybe the questions everyone is trying to get at, and I'll try to ask it may be a little differently is -- so as you stated, you're expecting to see NGL volumes come down, but you also said at the sort of tail end of that, that you're contracted on your pipeline and the LPG exports and your frac. So can you just address the contracted position? Because I think what everyone's trying to figure out is why are you adding frac capacity and LPG export capacity when it seems like production is going down so how protected are you with contracts?
Matthew Meloy: Sure. Yes, thanks, Michael. Yes, I'll start on the fracs and then hit on the exports as well, and then Scott, you can fill in too. On the fractionation side, we have significant number of third-party customers, we have long-term fractionation contracts with. A lot of those are transportation in fractionation and a lot of our simple, just fractionation agreements. And then we have additional volumes moving through our system, through our gathering and processing business, which are underpinned by acreage dedications and volumes coming from our processing plants.  So when you look at our fractionation position, we're, obviously, anticipating there would be significant growth from our underlying acreage dedications, but we also have a ramp-up in our commitments in our MVCs. So whether they're T&F or fractionation, they're going to be ramping and these commitments ramp over time. And so that's what gave us the confidence to underwrite 2 trains, Train 7 and 8. So over time, we'll have our own volumes for ramping MVCs and commitments for highly -- a substantial majority, a very large portion of our fractionation position there.  But it's going to take a little bit longer. The ramp is going to take a little bit longer than we estimated when we underwrote those facilities. And we are so far along on Train 8 that there's not much cost savings to be had by delaying that. We can do better on optimizing, as Scott talked about earlier, optimizing our fracs, trying to lower cost by running things a little bit better. So we think it makes sense for us to go ahead and continue with Train 8. And then moving to the export side, we have -- we're significantly contracted. We're highly contracted last year. We're highly contracted right now. And we do have forward contracts that ramp up as we bring LEP3. So as we increase our capacity on the export side, we have more contracts that start as well. So we're highly contracted this year, even when taking into account the increased capacity.
Michael Blum: Great. I'm sorry, go ahead.
Scott Pryor: Michael, I'm sorry, this is Scott. Just to add to that a little bit. When you look at the volumes that we did across the fractionator in the first quarter, obviously, they were very strong. We appreciated the added capacity that came online during March with Frac Train 7. But as Matt alluded to, is we may see the ramp a little bit longer as we fill into the rest of the fractionation capacity that we're adding later this year. With that said, it also allows us the opportunity to reduce our capital exposure for 2020 as well as 2021, which we alluded to clearly in our script, as we talked about our capital spend. So we are positioned well as volume growth starts coming back to the marketplace over time. From the export perspective, we had a nice strong quarter.  And you can see, if you look at the materials that we put out there on our pages, we've had strong quarters, really good dating back to early 2019, every quarter was stronger with the export volumes going across our dock. We continue to see good exports in the month of April, and things are shaping up well. There's still strong demand for exports across the world. And as markets recover in the East, that just actually provides more benefit to us over the long haul. And you've also seen, just from a market perspective, some of the pull-down in production with the OPEC+ nations that adds some benefit to U.S. Gulf Coast volumes going out. So we feel very fortunate to be in the position we are within a very diverse downstream market that supports our upstream production growth.
Michael Blum: Great. I really appreciate it. One -- just 1 clarification question on something you said earlier. The shut-in numbers you put out there, the different percentages for the different patients, is that just for May? Or is that like what time period is that specifically?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. The numbers I gave, the 10% for Permian and the like was our estimate for what's going to be shut-in in May, kind of relative to current. So if you take kind of April or just kind of where we are kind of entering May, we would estimate 10% of those volumes to be shut-in, in the Permian, 10% in central and then 30% to 40% of the Badlands.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering and Holt.
Colton Bean: I appreciate the comments on the NGL storage. I think you guys have something around 100 million -- or 50 million, sorry, in Belvieu and another 20 million in Louisiana. Can you just frame for us to what degree that's available to you versus leased out to third parties?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. I'd say we have with 50 million in barrels in Belvieu, we have a lot of flexibility and capabilities to optimize our storage position. And you're right, a good portion of that is leased to third parties. A lot of it is for our own managing the engine out, the Y-grade coming in, the purity products, but we have a significant amount to move wells in from one purity product into another and have some flexibility and fungibility there as well. So I'd say, with our position, it just provides us a lot of ability to optimize that position. And so we feel good about that in this contango market.
Colton Bean: Got it. And then I think even prior to the volume reduction, you were already hedged around 80% or so on natural gas, but still some spot and correct me here, but I believe Waha was assumed at $0.50 or so. So with the forward curve now looking like $2-plus for Waha, can you just update us on what's assumed in the new guidance range?
Jennifer Kneale: We don't have what I characterize as a single price assumption. We've got a wide guidance range, Colton, and that's reflective of the uncertainty in the current market. Prices are moving around on a daily basis as they do, but it's difficult to say that there's a certain commodity price that's running through our new updated guidance range. It's based on a range of estimates for prices, shut-ins, activity levels, et cetera.
Colton Bean: Got it. I guess, directionally, is it fair to say that the Waha assumption may have moved higher? Or is that also still, I guess, included in that range?
Matthew Meloy: So I think given our hedged position for gas, the amount that it's moved around is not a large variable in the guidance range. We have significant amount hedged for 2020. So there's -- it's not a large driver for us in that guidance range. But Jen is right, we looked at this around. We looked at strip pricing as we were going through the volumes and updating it, but we looked at many different cases and many different pricing assumptions. But the gas price variability was not one of the larger drivers in that range.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Charles Barber: This is Charlie on for Jeremy. I just wanted to follow-up on the LPG export side. It sounded like volumes are still pretty strong through April and 2020 is pretty well contracted, but I was curious about how you think that trends kind of the balance of this year as we think about lower cost naphtha, just competing products? And then maybe how that leaks into 2021 and beyond. I don't know how low contracted you are there? How you feel about that? And if your strategy, how that's evolved?
Scott Pryor: Yes. Charlie, I would say -- this is Scott again. First off, when you look back at the fact that we're adding additional export expansion in the third quarter this year, we talked about that in our script as well. And that is supported by contracts that will be coming online that are tied to that expansion project. So that's the pieces that make us feel very good about the second half of 2020. Those contracts, obviously, flow into 2021, which are both supportive of propane exports as well as butane exports. And so from that perspective, we feel good about the growth. And again, like the fact that we're moving forward with that project coming online in the third quarter. As it relates to the naphtha-based products, there's been some refinery runs that have created some tightness in the marketplace. And some of the heavy-end derivatives that are impacted by that. So we continue to believe that we'll see strong exports for propane and butane, and there'll be limited, I guess, competition for that leading into '20 -- as the balance of '20 as well as 2021.
Charles Barber: All right. That's helpful. And then just one other from me. The $100 million cost reductions, I know a lot of that was tied to compensation and headcount. Curious if there's anything operationally you're doing to kind of slim down costs or anything that you can do. I think you noted that -- is that this $100 million was at least so, I don't know if there's more to come there.
Jennifer Kneale: Yes. I'd say that a significant portion of the $100 million of expected savings is OpEx. And so that does include some reduction in headcount, both in existing positions and then also in a lower expectation for hiring throughout the year out in the field. But our supply chain group, our operations groups are incredibly focused and have been very successful in identifying opportunities to rationalize costs on basically every line item. So you heard Matt mentioned some of them, like chemicals and lubricants, but it's really every single item that we're purchasing, we are trying to purchase better at a lower cost to Targa. So that will continue to be a focus and has been a very big focus of our operations and supply chain group really over the last year, but certainly, that focus has heightened here recently.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson with SunTrust.
Tristan Richardson: Really appreciate all the commentary around shut-ins and just what you're seeing on the supply side. Just, with respect to the supply side, as you went through that range of what potential outcomes, on the base case, where do you guys see a general resumption that shut-in production occurring, either a time frame or a price signal?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. I'd say in that downside scenario, which kind of got us to that low end 1.4 number, taking, call it, 30% shut-ins in the Permian for the rest of the year, that's not our base case. I just don't think it's going to be that severe for that long. I said in the script, it's probably more likely going to be a couple to a few months would be if you had to say what's a reasonable guess, maybe a couple to a few months seems like a reasonable guess. But we also qualify, I want to qualify that with we really -- there's a lot of uncertainty. And could it carry on much longer than a couple to a few months? That's certainly a possibility. When does worldwide demand come back? When do people start driving again? It's really hard to say when that demand comes back. So that's why we did want to kind of present a wider range and have a downside scenario that if this lasts longer and the cuts are even deeper than what we're likely going to see in May, how does Targa look? And that's why we kind of went with that wider range and did that. But ours would be -- our best guess would be something less than that downside case in terms of shut-in percentage.
Tristan Richardson: I appreciate it. Very helpful. And then, Jen, you mentioned working with customers to reduce commodity exposure. I think we generally think of that as a long term initiative. But does the current market advance those discussions? I mean understanding it's difficult to open up an existing contract with a customer in this environment, but just any thoughts there.
Jennifer Kneale: We continue to be focused on trying to enter into, amend, have the best possible contracts. And so that's always a focus for our commercial teams and then for others across the organization that are entered -- involved in purchasing and other things like that. On the gathering and processing side, we've talked fairly consistently over the last several quarters about our efforts to enter into more fee-based arrangements, have more fee-based floors. I think the lower commodity price environment highlights why that's important to us, particularly if we are going to spend capital. Now clearly, we're rationalizing capital. So that's a little less applicable right now. But that continues to be a big focus of ours, really across the organization is trying to improve contracts when we are given the opportunity.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.
Keith Stanley: Just a follow-up on the volume assumptions in the guidance. So the bottom end ties to 30% shut-ins through the rest of the year in the Permian, it sounds pretty conservative. What does it assume for other basins? And then what is the top end of the guidance range assumed for volumes, just at a high level?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. In terms of the production, we wanted to give you some clarity around that downside scenario related to our most impactful basin, which to us is the Permian because then it moves through Grand Prix and fractionation and export. The other basins are, to some extent, tied in, but not as much. So we did pull the operational guidance for this year and don't want to get too specific on kind of each system, what we assumed for those. I'd say the most impactful one is Permian. And we wanted to give you a sense that it's a conservative range there. I'd just say directionally, it was a higher percentage in the Badlands, and it was a lower percentage in our other regions as the others are more gassy-weighted. So just kind of directionally for those other areas.
Keith Stanley: Okay. And the top end, can you comment at all, just Permian what you guys were planning?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. So I mean we looked at shut-in cases. We looked at others where there was less. I think on the top end, we said it at the low end of our previous guidance range and said, let's look at a number of different volume cases, price cases, when things come back. So it's not a one street case, which was the low side, the mid and the high. It was a range of cases and we feel like in a number of those scenarios, they're going to shake out in that $1.4 billion to $1.625 billion. So to get up to the mid or higher, it would be less shut-ins percentage for less duration and doing well on optimization and cost savings and other items. So -- but it's not a discrete case tied to the high end, yes.
Keith Stanley: Okay. Follow-up question, just with any revised thoughts on what the company's leverage target would be? And how much of the priority it is to get there, I guess, quickly? I mean, it doesn't seem like the rating agencies are reacting very much to the sector as a whole with the downturn. So just how much of a priority is it if the rating agencies aren't really pressuring you? And just on capital allocation, would you expect looking forward beyond this year to be allocating most of the free cash flow to paying down debt on the balance sheet?
Jennifer Kneale: This is Jen. I think that for the last year-plus, we've talked very consistently about how reducing our overall leverage was the priority for us, the Paramount priority. And as we look forward and look at our profile of generating growing free cash flow as we move through time, it would be available for the repayment of debt just as a result of the dividend reduction plus lower capital spending. That means that we'll have a lot more flexibility than we would have previously prior to the dividend reduction to reduce our leverage more quickly.  So I think that we feel very well positioned from that perspective. I think for anybody that's lived through the last couple of months, having lower leverage clearly would feel better than being in position of higher leverage. And so we've talked about 4x on a consolidated debt-to-EBITDA basis, being sort of a target for ours, but that it was going to take us some time to get there and that we're willing to be patient to get there. I think we have that same patience to get there. But again, the dividend reduction potentially allows us to get there more quickly. Now does 4x consolidated end-up being the right leverage ratio to target or is it lower than that? I think that remains to be seen a little bit, but it potentially could be lower than 4x.  As you can imagine, after we reduced the dividend, we had calls with the rating agencies. And I think those were very constructive conversations, I think that they are appreciative of the steps that we have taken to shore up our balance sheet and to make sure that we have financial flexibility. So certainly, it doesn't feel like that's a catalyst that's pushing us to make different decisions than we otherwise might want to, but again, as we've consistently said for the last year, ideally, we would like for our business to grow into being an investment-grade business because that, again, enhances flexibility that we would have in difficult markets. And so that remains a priority, too.
Operator: I'm not showing any further questions. So I'll now turn the call back over to Sanjay for closing remarks.
Sanjay Lad: Great. Thank you. We thank everyone for being on the call this morning and appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. We will be available for any follow-up questions over the course of the day. Thank you, and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-20 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Targa Resources Corp Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Sanjay Lad, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, and please go ahead, sir.
Sanjay Lad: Thank you, Chris. Good morning, and welcome to the fourth quarter and full-year 2019 earnings call for Targa Resources Corp. The fourth quarter earnings release for Targa Resources Corp, along with the fourth quarter earning supplement presentation, are available on the Investors section of our website at targaresources.com. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include Targa Resources' expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings. Our speakers for the call this morning will be Joe Bob Perkins, Chief Executive Officer; Matt Meloy, President; and Jen Kneale, Chief Financial Officer. We will also have the following senior management team members available for Q&A. Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Sanjay. Good morning, and thank you to everyone for joining. It continues to be an exciting time at Targa with record quarterly and full-year adjusted EBITDA, as we benefit from numerous major projects that commenced operations in 2019. Those projects have successfully transformed Targa into a leading integrated midstream company. Completed projects and the cash flows from these projects position Targa very well over the long term. I want to say thank you to the exceptional Targa team for their continued focus and best-in-class execution, executing on projects on customer service on our company's long-term strategic priorities, and most importantly, safely and effectively operating our infrastructure facilities every day. As we wrap up a strong 2019 and look forward to 2020, I am very enthusiastic about the Targa leadership for the future. With Matt already performing in the CEO seat, officially so in a couple of weeks, complemented by Jim in the CFO role, and the entire executive team, Targa is in very fine hands. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.
Matthew Meloy: Thanks, Joe Bob, and good morning to everyone. Before I get into our results for the year, I would like to take a minute to say a few words about the founding executive team of Targa. The original founders started out as a management team with no assets, and through their leadership, hard work, dedication, integrity, and willingness to train and develop others created one of the premier integrated midstream companies. They individually and collectively made Targa what it is today, and our strong results in 2019 are a direct result of their leadership, vision over the past 15 plus years. So with that, on behalf of the current executive team and all Targa employees, we would like to personally thank you, Joe Bob, and Rene Joyce, the late Roy Johnson, Jim Whalen, Mike Heim, Paul Chung, and Jeff McFarland. So with that, now turning to our results. 2019 was a pivotal year for Targa, as we began to benefit from the cash flow ramp associated with our significant investment cycle. Even with NGL and natural gas prices at historic lows throughout much of 2019, we posted record full-year adjusted EBITDA results of $1.44 billion. We outperformed our expectations in 2019, driven by our Permian and Grand Prix volumes, and we've benefited from additional optimization opportunities in our NGL and natural gas businesses. We expect to carry forward this positive momentum throughout 2020 with strong volume growth in the Permian, driving NGLs down Grand Prix to our Mont Belvieu and Galena Park facilities. Let's first discuss our gathering and processing business. Overall, Targa's G&P volumes in 2019 exceeded our initial estimates. Our Permian volumes increased 32%, and total field volumes increased 15%. In the Permian, our systems remain highly utilized, and fourth quarter volumes in the Permian Midland sequentially increased 6% as we benefited from a full-quarter contribution from our new Pembrook plant. Our next Permian Midland plant gateway will be much needed when it comes online in the fourth quarter of 2020. We are assessing the timing of when in 2021 we will need the next Permian Midland plan. In the Permian Delaware, volumes in the fourth quarter sequentially increased 18% as our new Falcon plant, which was completed in late September, was ramping throughout the fourth quarter. Our next Permian plant, Peregrine, remains on schedule to begin operations in the second quarter of 2020. We also benefited in the fourth quarter from much needed incremental residue gas takeaway from the Permian, after the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline commenced full operations in late September. Looking forward, we expect strong volume growth across our Permian Midland and Delaware systems in 2020. Our growth is largely underpinned by the majors and large independents who are forecasting continued volume growth. We also continue to have success in adding fee floors and, or additional fee-based margin to our Permian G&P contracts, a strategic priority, which will continue in 2020 and beyond. Moving to the Badlands, our gathered gas volumes sequentially increased 29% in the fourth quarter, as our new Little Missouri Four plant continued to ramp. With incremental NGL takeaway capacity from the basin online in December, our Badlands volumes are expected to continue to increase looking forward. With the completion of Grand Prix, our fee-based margin is rapidly increasing, and our business mix has shifted more towards downstream. Driven by estimates of increasing fee-based margin from both our G&P and downstream businesses, we estimate that our fee-based margin will increase to about 80% in 2020. Our Grand Prix pipeline continues to perform very well, as deliveries into Mont Belvieu increased to average 266,000 barrels per day during the fourth quarter, as we benefited from our new Falcon plant and some shorter-term NGL transportation volumes. We anticipate Grand Prix volumes into Mont Belvieu to increase and average 275,000 to 300,000 barrels per day in 2020. Turning to our fractionation business, overall business fundamentals in Mont Belvieu continue to remain robust. Targa's fractionation volumes in 2019 increased 22% over the previous year, and our fractionation complex continues to operate at a high utilization rate. Train 7 is on track to be complete in late March 2020, and is anticipated to be highly utilized at start up. Construction continues on Train 8, which we continue to expect to be online late third quarter 2020. And our LPG export business, our recently completed debottlenecking projects, have enhanced our flexibility and increased our loading capabilities to where we can load up to 10 million barrels per month, and we benefited from sequentially higher LPG export loadings during the fourth quarter. Our next phase of export expansion at our Galena Park facility remains on track, and will increase our effective capacity to up to 15 million barrels per month in the third quarter of this year, depending on product size, vessel mix, and other factors. Our export facilities remain well contracted, as our commercial team continues active and productive dialogue with our customers. We expect LPG export volumes to increase in 2020 over the previous year. Our total net growth CapEx for 2019 was $2.28 billion, less than our guidance of $2.4 billion. Consistent with our November earnings call, we continue to expect to spend between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion on net growth capital in 2020. We remain focused on maintaining capital discipline across the organization, and we'll continue to prioritize future investments around our core strategy. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jen to discuss Targa's results for the quarter and present our 2020 outlook.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $465 million with dividend coverage of approximately 1.4 times. Our performance during the fourth quarter was driven by meaningful contributions from recently completed growth projects, particularly Grand Prix, and favorable market conditions in both our logistics and transportation and gathering and processing segments. We also benefited from approximately $35 million of items that I would characterize as one-time in nature. These one-time fourth quarter benefits included adjustments to certain operating and general and administrative expense estimates, and partner related reimbursements. We will provide some more color on fourth quarter 2019 versus first quarter 2020 when I describe our guidance shortly. Our full-year 2019 reported adjusted EBITDA was $1.435 billion, exceeding the high end of our financial guidance range. For the full year, significant commodity price headwinds were more than offset by the outperformance of our existing assets, and assets placed in service during the year. Turning to a couple of housekeeping items that you may have noticed in our earnings release this morning, realized hedge gains losses associated with our G&P equity volume hedges are now included in G&P segment gross margin, which we believe better aligns with how we evaluate the performance of our G&P segment. We also renamed our logistics and marketing segment to logistics and transportation to better align with the segment's asset level performance, given the recent completion of Grand Prix, and the change in naming convention did not impact previously reported results for the segment. Turning to hedging for full-year 2020, we have hedged approximately 80% of natural gas, approximately 75% of condensate, and approximately 60% of NGLs. Our increasing fee-based margin, complemented by our hedging program, provides us with cash flow stability. Additional related hedge disclosures, including 2021 percentages by commodity, can be found in our earnings supplement presentation. During the fourth quarter, we successfully issued $1 billion of 5.5% senior notes due in March 2030. Net proceeds from the senior notes offering were used to pay off borrowings under our TRP revolver. We had approximately $2.7 billion of available liquidity as of December 31. On a debt compliance basis, TRP's leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately 4.3 times versus a compliance covenant of 5.5 times. Our consolidated reported debt to EBITDA ratio was approximately 5.5 times. We expect that our leverage profile will improve through time, as we benefit from increasing margin contributions from assets recently placed in service, were expected to be placed in service, and lower growth capital spending. We are also continuing to assess selected asset sales to potentially accelerate the improvement of our leverage ratios. We closed on the sale of our Permian Delaware crude gathering assets in January for approximately $134 million, and are continuing to work through the evaluation of the potential sale of our Permian Midland crude gathering assets. Building off of our performance in 2019, let's turn to our expectations for 2020, which assume NGL composite barrel prices to average $0.45 per gallon, crude oil prices to average $52 per barrel, Henry Hub natural gas prices to average $2 per MMBtu, and Waha natural gas prices to average $0.50 per MMbtu for the year. Beginning with our operational expectations in the gathering and processing segment, we estimate total Permian natural gas inlet volumes for 2020 to increase approximately 20% on average over 2019 Permian inlet volumes. In 2020, we expect continued growth in Badlands crude and gas gathered volumes, and modest declines in our Central region. Overall, we estimate total field G&P natural gas inlet volumes for 2020 to increase approximately 10% on average over 2019 total field G&P inlet volume. Moving to our downstream segment and beginning with Grand Prix, as Matt mentioned, we anticipate throughput into Mont Belvieu to average between 275,000 and 300,000 barrels per day in 2020. We also expect our fractionation volumes to increase year-over-year, largely driven by continued growth in Permian G&P volumes, and the addition of Train 7 and 8, which will also support the expectation of increasing year-over-year LPG export volumes. Shifting to our financial expectations, we estimate full-year 2020 adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.625 billion and $1.75 billion, representing an 18% increase over 2019, based on the midpoint of our range. Full-year dividend coverage is estimated to be around 1.2 times, assuming a flat $3.64 annual dividend. We would also like to provide some additional color on expectations for the first quarter of 2020 versus the fourth quarter of 2019, particularly given the $35 million of one-time benefits in the fourth quarter. We are now halfway through the first quarter, and given the combination of the one-time items in the fourth quarter with headwinds associated with lower commodity prices, lower hedge gains, and higher expected operating expenses in G&A, we expect that first quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA will be lower than fourth quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA. First quarter 2020 operating expenses in G&A will be higher than the fourth quarter, largely from additional assets placed in service, higher ad valorem, and higher insurance and benefits costs. Overall, in 2020, operating expenses are estimated to increase over 2019, given all of the new assets in service and those coming online during this year, while per unit, operating expenses are expected to improve as we benefit from full-year operations and increased operating leverage from our expansion projects completed in 2019. As Matt also mentioned, our net growth CapEx for 2020 remains unchanged with a range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. This estimate includes the assumptions that we will be funding Pioneer's capital in Wes Tex for 2020 under the joint ventures non-consent provisions, and also that there will be some spending during the year for another plant in Permian Midland, even as we continue to evaluate timing of the project. Given our increasing asset base, our estimate for net maintenance CapEx for 2020 is approximately $150 million. For additional details related to our estimated 2020 outlook, please review our earnings supplement slides, which are posted on the Investor page of our website. With that, I will now turn it back to Matt for a few closing remarks.
Matthew Meloy: Thanks, Jen. In closing, we remain excited about Targa's long-term outlook. While there may be some uncertainty in global commodity markets related to the coronavirus and other macro factors, there is strength in what we can see for core business in 2020. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson with SunTrust. Your line is now open. 
Tristan Richardson: Hey, good morning. Can you hear me?
Matthew Meloy: Yes, we can. Good morning.
Tristan Richardson: Thank you. Just real quick on the supply side, it seems like it's a theme you guys have talked about quantifying the - could you quantify the general opportunity to reduce commodity exposure, whether it be from revenue floors, or escalators, or just outright contract renegotiations? Is there a way to frame up the potential there? 
Matthew Meloy: Well, I think we had that included in our 80% all in fee-based margin for 2020. Really, the opportunity for us to continue to increase our fee-based percentage is going to be on the one hand just increasing fee-based margin on the downstream side, but also going into those commodity sensitive contracts where there are no meaningful fees for those. And where we're spending dollars on additional infrastructure, we're going to need some fee-based protection for us to continue to spend capital. At gas prices between zero and $1 at Waha, and low NGL prices, we're going to need some fee-based protection for that investment. And we've had good success with our producers who understand that and want us to continue to move their volumes. So, we want to continue to be able to hook those up and move those to our plants, and so, we're aligned from that perspective, and we've had a lot of good progress, I'd say, in 2019. And we're continuing that progress in 2020.
Tristan Richardson: Helpful. And then just follow-up on the downstream side. Can you talk about - is the marketing margin opportunity in the downstream business enhanced now that Grand Prix is online? And is that opportunity reflected in the 2020 outlook, or should - if spread opportunities remain resilient, that could represent upside?
Matthew Meloy: So, I would say, partially as a result of Grand Prix being online, we have a lot more NGLs coming into our system. We have more fractionation capacity coming on. As we add fractionation, we're adding storage and related infrastructure, which allows us to take advantage of market contango and other things for marketing opportunities. So, I'd say as the overall volumes increase, we have more of those opportunities. We put in, I'd say, conservative estimates of those opportunities into our guidance. So, there is not zero in there, but it's a relatively modest expectation of some of those opportunities. 
Jennifer Kneale: Which is generally consistent, Tristan, with how we try to forecast those elements of the business with conservatism, and then hope to outperform as we move through the year if the opportunities present themselves. And 2019 was a year we did have significant opportunities, we highlighted 10 million of downstream opportunities in the second quarter that we quantified as one-time in nature and had additional opportunities as other assets came online through the year. So we expect some this year. It's just difficult to quantify at this point.
Tristan Richardson: Very helpful, thank you guys very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni with UBS. The line is now open.
Shneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning guys. Maybe just to follow-up or to clarify interest in first question, just with respect to fee based. It seems like you've gotten there ahead of schedule. Adding the assets that are fee-based, I think is what you said is the answer. But is adding the collars or they're trying to adjust contracts and so forth part of what's getting there and is there more opportunity to add incremental fee base from here just from those types of renegotiation?
Joe Bob Perkins: Sure. Yes, we have had, I'd say really good movement in terms of adding fee-based floors and fee-based components to existing contracts and, as we're contracting for new volumes coming in the Permian. So it's really both. Its new contracts and existing and we see the ability to be able to do more of that. So we're in various stages with our producers and discussing with them how we can meet their needs and the fee-based protection that we're going to need to be able to continue to meet their needs.
Shneur Gershuni: Okay. And just to clarify, you talked about adding the assumption fee that if you [indiscernible].
Jennifer Kneale: That's right if we bought in the DevCos then we would have additional fee-based margin as well.
Shneur Gershuni: Perfect. Just switching a little bit. I was wondering if we talk about the LPG export facility. You had a very strong quarter there obviously the new capacity was online, but it was exceptionally strong and just wondering if some of that was related to some of the propane ARBs that were out there. Where is this more a function of the fact that you added butane capacity and you're now better able to optimize requirements and if so, does that mean when you add more refrigeration in the third quarter, later this year that we can actually see further optimizations from there as well to of customer demand?
Scott Pryor: Shneur, this is Scott. We did have a nice quarter. When you look at third quarter over fourth quarter, we had about a 12% increase in our volumes across our dock from those quarters. Additionally, we saw a 17% increase, as we said in our script from 2018 to 2019 as we continue to bring projects online that really helped us debottleneck the facility. Much of that was butane related and the improvements we saw from third quarter to fourth quarter was predominantly around the butane molecule, so we've benefited from those debottlenecking projects as a result of that. We view ourselves is pretty much highly contracted. As we roll through this year of 2020, we're going to benefit from increased volumes flowing through our systems, all the way from our upstream through Grand Prix through our Downstream assets as a whole, which will dictate opportunities to put more barrels across our dock. That's the reason why we're adding the additional capacity in the third quarter of this year with the increased refrigeration capacity that we're bringing online. So we still view ourselves as highly contracted. With that said, with the assets that we put in place with the projects that we put in place, it helped us really mitigate times where we've seen even in the first quarter, we've had some issues with fog delays and so fog delays kind of take away from that opportunity, if you will, to maybe participate in the stock market because we want to make sure that we're performing on the contracts that we have across our dock today. So we have added new contracts on term related business that will kind of come in toward the latter half of this year with the expansion project. We've had great success in renewing all of our contracts across the dock. So we have - we're highly contracted and we feel very comfortable with the fees that we've done with the term related business. We're definitely going to benefit with increased volumes of flowing through our systems that will find their way all the way to the dock, which again provides flow assurance, all the way back to the wellhead for the producers, that are on our systems.
Shneur Gershuni: Okay. That makes perfect sense, sounds like it's ratable. Then just one final question if I may, given the amount of spare for our capacity that's out there in the market, is there a way for you to capitalize on using effectively an asset-light strategy on a go-forward basis and potentially delay the need for fracturing 9 where you can utilize some other frac space and so forth and see an opportunity for CapEx to step down and be delayed a little bit while you optimize other people's spare capacity.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes. So as we said in the call Train 7 will be highly utilized and we have Train 8 coming on and when that comes on it will give us some excess capacity in our system as we wait for future growth and as our volume commitments and NBC's from our customers kick in. I would say there is an opportunity with others also having fractionation coming on. We don't necessarily need to be just in time with fracturing nine, so it will give us a little bit of opportunity to be before we go ahead in green light and say we need to add Train 9. I think another thing that we're benefiting from and you saw this in Q4, is our fracs are running even better than anticipated. We call Train 600,000 barrel a day Frac. If you look at what the fractionation volumes for Q4, it looks like it was over nameplate. That's because we're able to run Train 6 at higher than 100. So we're also creating a little more capacity, which could push out Train 9 as well. So I say through our own optimization of our assets and potentially looking elsewhere, we feel pretty good about being able to move Train 9 a little bit further out.
Shneur Gershuni: All right, perfect. That makes perfect sense. Thank you very much for the color guys. And once again congratulations on volume growth.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to start with the guidance here and it's encouraging to see the level of growth that you talk about both on the G&P side and also Grand Prix. I was wondering if you could kind of provide a bit more color as far as what type of cadence you see to that growth over the year. Any thoughts on what that type of exit rate could look like just trying that- as we model for the route, get a sense for how things are playing out there.
Jennifer Kneale: Jeremy, this is Jen. We tried to provide you with a little bit of color certainly related to first quarter relative to fourth quarter, particularly as a result of those $35 million of one-time benefits that we tried to discuss in a little bit of detail on our commentary in the press release and also in our scripted comments. We're not going to get into providing quarter-by-quarter guidance related to EBITDA or really any of the other metrics that we've put out there this morning. I think that 2019 was a great year for our company. Excellent execution, really across all fronts, particularly when you think about new assets that came online and how well they performed. We've got additional assets coming online in 2020 and hope that those perform as well as those that came online in 2019 did and we'll just have to see how the year plays out. We have had some headwinds already thus far in 2020 with commodity prices with sort of the typical seasonality and freeze-offs that we generally have early in January. You never really can quantify all the pluses and minuses that will occur during the year and that's generally one of the reasons that we like to provide annual guidance versus quarterly guidance.
Jeremy Tonet: That's helpful. And then maybe just clarifying on the Q1 being lower than Q4 was that versus the 430 number that exclude some of those one-time items or is that versus the 465? Just trying to quantify the impact there.
Jennifer Kneale: If you go back and have a chance to re-read the script, we tried to provide a little bit more color in there. So it's really- it's versus the 465. So yes, includes the one-time items. So we're trying to direct you certainly to remove those when you think about Q1 relative to Q4 and also provided a little bit of detail that OpEx and G&A will be higher in Q1 than it was in the fourth quarter as well. Consistent with the expectation that 2020 OpEx and G&A will be higher as well than 2019.
Jeremy Tonet: That's helpful, thanks. And just the last one if I could, it seems like you've done a really good job recently of divesting some non-core assets to help accelerate deleveraging there and just wondering, I know you're not going to tell us what assets you're selling, but just wondering anymore you could share on the thought process. If I look around the portfolio and I see ownership in something like GCX and I see- it's nice to have the capacity on the pipe but I don't know if we necessarily need to own the pipe anymore now that bill, just wondering whether types of opportunities you guys see to raise some funds there.
Jennifer Kneale: The only asset sale process that we currently have underway is the one related to the Permian Midland crude business, Jeremy. So we'll continue to assess other opportunities all across the portfolio, but there's nothing else active at this time. So clearly, we've demonstrated a willingness if assets are not what we consider core to the Permian aggregation of supplier G&P aggregation of supply of hit transport to frac to volumes available for exports than we will consider whether there is a third party that would be a more likely owner of the asset than we are.
Jeremy Tonet: That's all from me. Thanks for taking my question.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Michael Blum: Great. Good morning, everybody. I just had two questions, one on Grand Prix. Can you just maybe explain the outperformance you're seeing on volumes versus your sort of prior expectation? Was that just conservatism or is something changing either with your own plans or third party volumes that's causing those numbers to keep moving higher?
Joe Bob Perkins: Hey, Michael, I'd say it's a number of factors. I'd say to start it was probably a little conservative when we initially gave and it was a while ago, we gave that estimate of 250,000 barrels at some point in 2020 and then we just left that there not wanting to update that one. Actually get it operating before we revise our guidance and wanted to show it performing. So I'd say, part of it was conservatism, but I'll also say we saw really strong volume growth across our Permian system. We outperformed our volume guidance in 2019. That provided more NGLs on our system. I'd say third parties, we've had good success in attracting others down the pipe as well has been a benefit versus our original expectations, when we gave that original guidance and we're also going through all of our plants and optimizing. So we'll send the engineering team out to our plants and trying to squeeze more NGLs increased recoveries and you're seeing that in our numbers as well. So we're trying to enhance recoveries on these points that we're putting in as well. So it's a number of factors.
Michael Blum: Okay, great. And then second question is, so obviously EBITDA is trending very nicely. Could just get your latest thoughts on DevCo and the timing of when you're may or may not start buying some of that back in?
Jennifer Kneale: Sure. Michael, this is Jen. I think consistent with our third quarter commentary around the DevCos nothing has really changed. Fourth quarter performance was stronger than we expected. Ultimately, we'd like to see how 2020 performance shakes out before we likely start buying back pieces of the DevCo. Our focus right now is on improving our leverage metrics. So there is really no change to the underlying assumption that we really said when we entered into the DevCo arrangements which was for modeling purposes if you want to assume that we take the entire structure out in 2022 given we've got 4 years as of the fourth quarter of 2019 to do so. That's a fine assumption. If you want to assume with increasing EBITDA that we may derisk the overall structure and take out by taking out a piece earlier given we can take out a piece or pieces in $100 million increments. That's a fine assumption as well. So I think either of those are consistent with how we're looking at it internally right now, which again is consistent with how we've been looking at it really since we entered into the transaction.
Michael Blum: Right. Thanks, Jen.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Spiro Dounis: Hey, morning, everyone. First question just follow up on the 2020 EBITDA guidance. A lot of us just trying to reconcile the strength in that guidance. It seems like getting to the high and low ends of the range is going to take maybe a lot more than just the commodity movements. So just curious if you just walk us through some of the other major variables that flex that up and down.
Jennifer Kneale: I think that for us the guidance range is really reflective of our best estimates right now for the year, given the visibility that we have into the year. 2019 was very strong for us. We believe that there will continue to be opportunities for our assets to hopefully outperform in 2020. But there is also uncertainty related to prices, the coronavirus, producer activity levels, particularly in the back half of the year and so that's why there is a wider range on the absolute dollars than we have generally presented in years past.
Spiro Dounis: Understood. And then that sets into the next question just around hedging and getting ahead of some of that risk. So just two-part question here. First one just clarification on that call it dollar 70-ish hedge price you've got in there. Is that just Henry Hub or have you put in a Waha component to that? Then second, are you hedging today in this market right now or your model is telling you to wait for a stronger entry point?
Jennifer Kneale: On the hedges that's reflective of the aggregate hedges that we've entered into so it includes all our basis hedges. I think that you'll see us continue to hedge when given the opportunity. Clearly, we added a fair bit of hedges really from our fourth quarter disclosures on through the early part of the year, given the point of view that we have internally related to prices. On the NGL side, we remain less hedged than we ideally would like to be at this point, and that's really just a result of ethane prices, which is the largest part of our NGL barrel and sort of where ethane prices have been for some time. But to the extent that we get any strength that we can hedge into, we'll do that, as well as just continuing with our programmatic hedge program that we work through with the hedge committee of our board.
Spiro Dounis: Very helpful. Thanks, Jen.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks, Spiro.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open.
Colton Bean: Morning. So, just to follow up on Scott's commentary around the LPG exports, it looks like the disclosure there implied a slight shift in C3 C4 mix. I think it's 75% propane now, at least on a trailing basis. Is there any potential to push more volumes into butane weighted markets like India to increase the utilization of that butane loading capabilities over the course of the year?
Joe Bob Perkins: Colton, I would say that the lifters that we have kind of dictate what their desired mixes are. Clearly with a lot of the waterborne traders, volumes are moving to where the demand pool is at. A lot of that growth obviously is in the East in the Asian marketplaces. And we've talked about it in the past. With the developing countries, a lot of that is both a propane and butane mix. We did benefit from third quarter to fourth quarter with larger percentages of butane moving across our dock, and that certainly - we are gearing ourselves up so that we have that capability going forward, and that's the reason why we kind of give a broad range relative to what our capabilities are, that it is dependent upon how much as propane versus butane and the size of vessels. So, I think you'll continue to perhaps see increased volume percentage of butanes going across our dock, and hence the reasons why we put our debottlenecking projects in place.
Colton Bean: Got it. And then Matt, I think you touched on some of the moving pieces on both Train 9 and the timing of the next Permian plant beyond Gateway. As we look at that and try to reconcile versus that prior $1.8 billion of capital for 2020 and 2021, any other considerations beyond Bluestone?
Matthew Meloy: Yes, I mean, just to bring that $1.8 billion to current net I was given over a year ago, and we added the Bluestone, which was 200, and then in our call last summer, we mentioned at our processing plants, there were three of them in there, and they were about $30 million higher relative to the original expectations. So, that would bring it to kind of that 21 number. And I think as you look forward to 2021, how much CapEx that's going to be, it's really going to be dependent upon our underlying volumes out in the Permian, how much success we're having out there. We've indicated likely another Midland plant here. Timing is still uncertain. I think with Peregrine coming on and Falcon just coming on, we probably have a little more timing and a little more runway on the Delaware side of when we add a plant, but it's just going to depend on how volumes ramp this year. But as you look to 2021, it's likely going to be processing plants, maybe potential fractionation spending on Train 9, depending on that timing. With our export dock going in here, we should be okay there for a while. So, it's going to be a regular, probably normal course CapEx for 2021. 
Colton Bean: Got it. Appreciate that.
Matthew Meloy: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.
Sunil Sibal: Yes, hi. Good morning, guys. Couple of questions from me, starting out with the CapEx. I think you indicated that '19 came out like $120 million below what you had guided to, and 2020 CapEx guidance was maintained. So, I was curious, is it at some scope of projects? Are finding cost can be coming out lower on all the projects?
Matthew Meloy: Yes, I would say it's really as our - as we continue to focus on capital discipline, and scrutinize every project, and just push our organization to focus capital in and along the core business that we talked about, gathering and processing where it's tied into Grand Prix, into fractionation and export. So, I think at just as we increase the level of scrutiny, looking at our projects, being very careful and diligent before we're green lighting anything new, we were able to come in under for 2019. And that didn't rollover, frankly, into changing our 2020 estimate. So, I think it's just continued capital discipline, operating cost, G&A, kind of everything we're pushing through as an organization, we're starting to see some of those positive results.
Sunil Sibal: Okay. And then just wanted to reconcile with your guidance on the Grand Prix NGL volumes. So, it seems like from what you did in the fourth quarter, for full-year 2020, you are expecting a modest 10% or so uptick. However, on the frac side, you also commented that you expect the new frac to start fairly full. I was just kind of curious, how do we reconcile those two, and also, if you could talk anything about your assumptions on ethane rejection going into 2020, if there are any significant assumptions made there?
Matthew Meloy: Sure. I guess I'll start with fractionation Train 7 being full. So, we have been running over nameplate. We have inventory, right? So, we're going to be working off existing - we have a lot of storage capacity, but we're going to be working off inventory when 7 comes on and as volumes continue to ramp. So, I think as you look at the Grand Prix volumes, they're going to be underpinned. We'll have Peregrine coming on. But as I said, we'll have some capacity in the Delaware. So it's - we have some excess capacity now, so we see kind of modest increases there with the Peregrine coming on. And then we have the Gateway coming on. It's not coming until really the fourth quarter, so those - we expect that to be highly utilized at start up, but that's going to be coming on in the fourth quarter. Then it's going to be our third-party volumes on Grand Prix. We do expect some growth there. We have that baked into our forecast. And then I'd say the other offset, which I didn't mentioned before, we did benefit in late 2019 from some shorter-term transportation-only agreements, or shorter term TNF agreements, last year. We have a, I'd say, conservative assumption related to kind of non-contracted volumes in 2020. Are there going to be opportunities to move barrels for some of our customers either midstream, or producers on a shorter-term basis? I think there will be some of those opportunities, but we didn't factor those opportunities into our 2020 numbers.
Sunil Sibal: Okay, got it. And then one housekeeping for me. So, I think you guys touched upon the $35 million tailwinds that you've got on OpEx and other items in Q4. Were those kind of focused in or concentrated in any particular business unit or in any particular geography?
Jennifer Kneale: Sunil, this is Jen. We talked about the fact that that was really made up of a combination of OpEx estimates, G&A estimates, and then also some partner reimbursements. And so, it was a combination of factors really across the board. Generally, we've talked on the third quarter, which was also consistent with the fourth quarter, that our estimates for ad valorem taxes came in lower in actuals than what we had assumed. We also benefited from lower benefits costs through the year than we expected, and we did less hiring for the year than we expected or estimated. So really, it's more a corporate level than specific to any individual business unit.
Sunil Sibal: Okay, got it. That's all I had. Thanks for all the color, and congrats on a really good quarter.
Matthew Meloy: Okay, thank you.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks, Sunil.

At this time, all participants are in listen only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Sanjay Lad, Senior Director of investor relations. Sir, please go ahead.
Sanjay Lad: Good morning, and welcome to the third quarter 2019 earnings call for Targa Resources Corp. The third quarter earnings release for Targa Resources Corp, along with the third quarter earnings supplement presentation are available on the Investor section of our website at targaresources.com. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include Targa Resources' expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings. Our speakers for the call today will be Joe Bob Perkins, Chief Executive Officer; Matthew Meloy, President; and Jennifer Kneale, Chief Financial Officer. We'll also have the following senior management team members available for Q&A. Patrick McDonie, President Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President Logistics and Marketing; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. Joe Bob will begin today's call with a few strategic highlights, followed by Matt who will provide an update on business outlook. And then Jim will discuss third quarter results before we take your questions. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Sanjay. Good morning, and thank you to everybody on the call. Before we get into our remarks, I'd like to acknowledge the recent retirement of Jeff McParland. Consistent with our long term succession planning. Most recently, Jeff served as President of administration. Jeff was also Targa's first CFO. On behalf of the entire Targa team, we thank Jeff for his tremendous leadership and help shaping our financial organization in Targa's early years. It continues to be an exciting time at Targa. We're beginning to benefit from numerous major projects now online, most of which began over 2 years ago. This year, we completed and commenced operations on approximately $4 billion worth of projects. Projects which have successfully transformed Targa into a leading integrated midstream company. These completed projects and the cash flow from these projects positions Targa very well. Our balance sheet and cash flow profile are expected to strengthen meaningfully as we move forward. And we will capture improved returns on capital, benefiting from our integrated platform and lower capital spin. I want to express my personal thanks to the exceptional team at Targa for their continued focus and commitment, executing on these projects, on our company's long term strategic priorities and most importantly, safely operating our infrastructure facilities every day. With premier assets and a premier reputation in both our gathering and processing business and in our downstream NGL business and with those assets and reputation complemented by our talented leadership and employees, Targa is very well positioned for the future. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt to discuss our business outlook.
Matthew Meloy: Thanks, Joe Bob, and good morning. It certainly is an exciting time at Targa. Q3 was a strong quarter as we are beginning to benefit from the cash flow ramp associated with our significant investment cycle. Since our second quarter conference call we completed our new 250 million cubic feet per day Falcon plant in Permian Delaware, and the rebuild of Dock 2 at our LPG export facilities in Galena Park. Our Grand Prix pipeline continues to perform very well since commencing operations in early August. On our last earnings call, we said we expected volumes of about 200,000 barrels per day. And we exceeded those expectations averaging about 230,000 barrels per day of deliveries into Bellevue in September. We anticipate volumes to continue to improve going forward and will provide more information on 2020 volume expectations when we give our formal operational and financial guidance in February. As we think about our positioning going forward, there are some key points I like to touch on in summary, and then I will expand on as well. First, our gathering and processing business is growing and expected to continue to have strong performance even if we experience a moderation of production growth. Second, our growth is coming from primarily fee-based assets driving a higher percentage of fee-based margin and less commodity price sensitivity. Third, our continued organization-wide focus on capital discipline, largely along our core business of moving molecules from GMT transport fractionation and export is leading to more moderate capital spend going forward. And forth, our financial metrics are improving and expected to improve going forward as we benefit from our integrated platform growing EBITDA, lower CapEx and better returns. Let's talk about our gathering and processing business. Beginning in the Permian, our systems remain highly utilized as volumes across both the Midland and Delaware basins have been tracking above our initial expectations. In Permian Midland volumes in the third quarter sequentially increased 8% as our Pembroke plant quickly ramped up in September. Our next Permian Midland plant gateway is on track to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2020. In Permian Delaware, volumes in the third quarter sequentially increased 15% as production from our customers continue to ramp. We completed our new Falcon plant ahead of schedule and commenced operations at the end of the third quarter. Falcon is quickly ramping and we remain on track to complete our next Permian Delaware plan Peregrine in the second quarter of 2020. We expect volumes to increase across our Permian Midland and Permian Delaware systems in 2020 from continued production growth collectively from our diverse customer base, full year contributions from our recently completed processing plants in 2019 and our new plants that will begin operations in 2020. We remain in regular dialogue with our producer customers and our growth is underpinned by the majors and large independents who are forecasting continued growth. With our integrated system, the increasing NGL production from Targa plants will largely be transported down Grand Prix into our fractionation complex. The Gulf Coast Express pipeline commenced full operations in late September and provided much needed incremental residue gas into premium markets. Moving to the Badlands, our gas gathered volume increase in the third quarter as a result of incremental processing capacity available from the recent completion of our new little Missouri full plant. The volumes will continue to ramp through the balance of this year as incremental NGO, take away capacity from the base and comes online. But the completion of many downstream system expansions including Grand Prix, our business mix has shifted more towards downstream resulting in increasing fee-based margin. We also have a key strategic initiative underway, which includes increasing our fee based margin across our gathering and processing business. We continue to pursue opportunities with our customers to review current and prospective commercial arrangements and have had recent success and converting certain percentage of proceeds arrangements to fee-based arrangements and have also added incremental fee-based elements. We now estimate our fee based margin to increase in 2020, to be about 80% of our forecasted operating margin. Turning to our downstream business, overall business fundamentals in Mont Belvieu continue to remain robust. During the third quarter we completed a scheduled turnaround and related maintenance at are fractionation complex in Mont Belvieu. Without the turnaround we expected volumes would have been higher by approximately 50,000 barrels per day. In with the turnaround now complete, our fractionation complex continues to operate at very high utilization rates. Construction continues on train 7 and 8, which are expected to be online late first quarter and late third quarter of 2020 respectively. We expect both frack trains to be highly utilized at startup based on our expectation of growing NGO volumes from Grand Prix and contracted third party arrangements. In our LPG export business, we completed our dock 2 rebuild at the end of the third quarter of 2019, which enhances our flexibility and increases our loading capabilities, where we can now load up to 10 million barrels per month of LPG beginning in the fourth quarter, depending on the product mix, vessel size, among other factors. Our next phase of export expansion at our Galena Park facility remains on track as well and will increase our effective capacity up to 15 million barrels per month in the third quarter of 2020. For the completion of Grand Prix and several gathering and processing and downstream expansion projects in 2019, that trajectory of our capital spend is substantially moderate. We continue to be highly focused on managing our net growth CapEx with discipline and continue to estimate approximately 2.4 billion for this year, and based on current assumptions, our preliminary outlook for 2020 net growth CapEx is approximately 1.2 billion to 1.3 billion. Our preliminary estimate includes the remaining spend on projects currently underway across our GMP and downstream businesses, plus our current best planning assumptions for additional infrastructure from new projects. The timing of moving forward with new Permian gas processing plant and additional fractionation expansion among Bellevue is predicated on our outlook for estimated volume growth and activity levels, which would impact whether we're at the lower or higher end of our estimated net growth capital range. As a result of the timing of that capital spend. We continue to thoroughly evaluate and highly scrutinize all future new capital projects, prioritizing future investments around our core strategy with a continued focus on balance sheet improvement over time. With that I will now turn the call over to Jen to discuss Targa's results for the third quarter.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks Matt, good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $350 million with dividend coverage of approximately one times. In our GMP segment operating margin contribution from higher sequential inlet volumes led by our Permian Midland and Permian Delaware region was partially offset by the impact of lower NGL and crude oil prices. Net and realized hedge gains third quarter GMP operating margin was about $15 million higher than our second quarter. In our logistics and marking segment operating margin sequentially increased predominantly due to a partial quarter contribution from Grand Prix. The impact of the schedule turnaround in our fractionation facilities during the third quarter was offset by the early startup of GCX. Operating expenses in our GMP segment in the third quarter decreased over the second quarter, primarily due to lower property tax estimates, while the increase in sequential downstream operating expenses, was attributable to a full quarter of transfix operations and a partial quarter of Grand Prix deliveries into Mount Belleview. Turning to hedging our percent proceeds equity commodity positions are well hedge as we continue to execute additional hedges to increase cash flow stability. We are more than 80% hedged across all commodities for the fourth quarter and more than 50% hedged across all commodities for 2020. Additional updated hedge disclosures can be found in our investor presentation. During the third quarter we recognize and unrealized non-cash Mark to market loss of $101 million associated with hedging our natural gas transportation agreement, which will be offset by underlying law and transportation gains in future. As Matt mentioned our 2019 net growth CapEx estimates for announced projects remains at approximately $2.4 billion and we have spent about $1.9 billion through the end of the third quarter, our full year 2019 maintenance CapEx forecast remains unchanged at approximately $130 million. On a debt compliance basis TRPs leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was approximately 4.7 times versus a compliance covenant of 5.5 times. Our consolidated reported debt to EBITDA ratio was approximately 5.8 times, using annualized third quarter EBITDA to calculate our consolidated leverage our debt to EBITDA ratio was 5.4 times which we think is more reflective of our leverage trajectory given our expectation to benefit from ramping EBITDA. We also continue to evaluate and execute asset sales as a catalyst to reduce leverage. During the third quarter, we closed on the sale of an equity method investment for $70 million. In our press release, we announced that we are evaluating the potential of divestiture of our crude gathering business in the Permian, which includes crude gathering and storage assets in both the Delaware and Midland basin, I'm very pleased to announce that we have an update to our earlier press release and we have now executed agreements to sell our Permian Delaware crude business to works [ph] midstream for approximately $135 million, subject to customary regulatory approvals, including submissions. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019. I would like to publicly thank our team that worked tirelessly through the night and early morning to execute the agreement. Combined these asset sales were executed in an attractive double-digit multiple of EBITDA. We're also evaluating the potential sales remaining Permian crude storage and gathering assets in the Midland basin. No common equity has been issued year-to-date and based on current market conditions, our expectation is that we do not need to issue any equity into the foreseeable future as we benefit from increase in cash flow and lower leverage from our projects now in service. Consistent with our expectations entering 2019, adjusted EBITDA and dividend coverage are expected to be at their highest points for the year during the fourth quarter, providing Targa with significant momentum as we exit 2019. With that, I would like to turn it back to Matt for a few closing comments.
Matthew Meloy: Thanks, Jen. I'd also like to bring to your attention our inaugural sustainability report, which we published in August highlighting our framework of policies, practices, and systems in areas of safety, environmental, social and governance. We remain focused in continuing to progress our disclosures in these areas and to enhance our performance. So with that operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is open.
Shneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning, everyone. We can start off with, you know, you have Grand Prix coming online, a lot of fee-based that's coming online, and your - your fee-based component of earnings is definitely increasing. But there's also been some talk about some commercials that you and some others have had in converting percentage of proceed contracts, - to sort of bring the exposure down further. Can you talk a little bit about this? Have you had some successes? Do you expect more successes, if so, and we should be thinking about it on a go-forward basis?
Matthew Meloy: Sure. So in our commodity sensitive areas, as we're going out and continuing to spend capital to hook up additional wells and facilitate growth for our producers. Given current commodity prices the returns on some of those are, you know, relatively low compared to recent points in history when you look at commodity prices. So it's not too difficult to have a discussion, you have to have them to show what our overall margins are. And we want to continue to invest for our producers. So we're adding fee-based components to those contracts. We're adding some fee floors and instances. Sometimes we're moving to - completely to fee, so it just depends on producer preferences. But we would like to see a meaningful - if not - the majority or plus of fee base to protect our investment as we go forward.
Shneur Gershuni: All right. Perfect. And as a follow-up question. Really pleased to see the asset sales plus that you just talked about in your prepared remarks. Do you see any more opportunities for asset sales down the road? Like, would you consider selling GCX when the DevCo presumably comes in house?
Matthew Meloy: So the other asset that we named in the press release this morning was our crude business in the Midland. So that's another one that we're in the process now. We've engaged Jefferies, and we're going to look to monetize that. I think we're going to continue to look across our asset base and see what - what might be complimentary, if it's not core, and down our strategic gas value chains of gathering and processing all the way down to the export doc. We're going to have a discussion and take a hard look at it. But right now, the only one that's really on that would be the crude business in the Midland side.
Shneur Gershuni: Great. One final question. How much flex do you have to be towards the lower end of your growth CapEx range for 2020?
Matthew Meloy: Well, I think, they sort of give a relatively narrow range, you know, as we're ramping up our internal processes for what projects we want to include and what that budget's going to look like for 2020. I think we feel pretty comfortable with that 1.2 to 1.3, and then it's really going to be when we add another processing plant in the Permian. We're going to have some spending in 2020 or does it get pushed to the end of 2020. That's what's going to really move the 1.2 to 1.3, timing of when processing is getting added. And then when we green light, you know, frac train 7 and 8 fill up. Are we ordering long lead times for train 9 and other things? So that's why I think there's a relatively tight range. And then it's just the completion of our major projects already underway, it's a majority of that.
Shneur Gershuni: All right? Perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate the time today.
Matthew Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Spiro Dounis: Good morning, everyone. Maybe starting off with 2020 growth CapEx, if you could, coming down significantly, great to see. Just curious what you think about the backlog beyond 2020? You guys have got it to aggregate CapEx at one point of about $1.8 billion between 2020 and 2021, which I guess implies maybe $500 million or $600 million in 2021. How much could we see that figure kind of change over time? Or is the right way to think about it that you maybe use any sort of excess spending capacity to bind the DevCo interest instead of new projects?
Matthew Meloy: Yes, I think as we look at our capital spending trajectory, I think 2020 is a big step for us. You know, it's about half of what it was last year. So you're seeing that CapEx moderate. I think when we gave that guidance back in November of last year, the point of that was to show that going forward, the CapEx is going to be moderating significantly. I think 2020 shows that, but even in 2020, we have, you know, spending on two fractionation trains, which is higher than a normal amount of spending would be for fractionation, right? So, we plan to give annual guidance. So 2020 shows a step in the right direction, significantly moderated CapEx. Then, as we move through the year, you know, we'll give annual guidance for 2021.
Jennifer Kneale: It will largely be predicated on activity levels. Right, Spiro? So at this point, when we think about the assets coming online in 2020, the expectation is that they will be highly utilized relatively quickly. Train 7, we could use, you know, pretty much very quickly today. And so I think that if activity levels stay consistent with where they are today with our expectations for the near term, then obviously CapEx would be higher as a result of that. If activity levels decrease, then I think we've got more flex as we go through time to delay the timing of when we have our next plant in the Permian, either the Midland and the Delaware site, or when we would need that additional fractionation in Bellevue.
Spiro Dounis: Okay, that makes sense. And just circling back on asset sales. Congrats on getting the deal done so quickly. Maybe just talk about how you think about using the proceeds. Maybe as you look at basins or assets outside of - outside of the Permian, where maybe growth is a little bit slower, where CapEx needs, I imagine, are much lower. How do you think about the valuation hurdle there to sell those assets, which I presume they're sort of free cash flow positive at this point?
Jennifer Kneale: Good question. We've got a lot of interest in assets across the portfolio, and we've gotten a lot of reverse inquiry around different assets. We're very pleased with the announcement this morning that we were able to successfully execute agreements on the Permian and Delaware crude side, and now we'll be evaluating the potential sale of the Permian, Midland crude assets. When you look across the portfolio beyond that, I think that everything is for sale for the right price. That's part of our jobs. But as you rightly point out, there are some areas within our system where we're spending relatively little capital, where we've been incredibly successful in reducing costs and really squeezing every last dime out of assets that we possibly can. And so getting evaluation that makes sense for us to sell those assets versus just continuing the harvest with that cash flow can be a difficult decision, but we're always open to evaluating anything that's in our portfolio.
Matthew Meloy: And just to add on to that to Jen, you know where - we have been active in that market as a buyer, and as you see now, as a seller. For selling assets in the GNP, it's not a great market for that. So we're looking around that potential opportunities and what we could or could not monetize. You know, it's not a great market for that on the gas gathering and processing side.
Spiro Dounis: Got it. Appreciate all that color. Thanks, everyone.
Matthew Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tristan Richardson from SunTrust. Your line is open.
Tristan Richardson: Good morning, guys. Just on the 1.2 to 1.3. Sounds like there is some assumption of new project potential in that number. Could you give us a sense of buckets between, sanctioned projects and then kind of the wedge of potential projects that you've got high visibility to that aren't necessarily green lit today?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. So most of that spending is related to projects that are already underway, right? Train 7, train 8, Gateway, Peregrine Export Facility. I think the reason it's relatively tight range is we do expect highly likely to be announcing another plant out in the Permian. So there will be some spending for that. And that's why we gave a range. You know, we see it is about $100 million range for depending on when we green light that plant. And then when and Y-grade volumes are increasing as a result of production activity. If we're going to have any spending or some modest amount of spending on train 9 for 2020. So those are the two, kind of, drivers to be at the high end or low end of that range.
Jennifer Kneale: As Matt mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are expecting growth from the producers on our systems, particularly in the Permian. And so there is a lot of spending that we're assuming will take place to facilitate their growth as they continue to drill and be successful.
Joe Perkins: Matt, I would add one other project to that and that is the extension of our Grand Prix pipeline North into Stach that is highly backed by Williams contract.
Matthew Meloy: Agreed, that's another large project, thanks.
Jennifer Kneale: That is in there.
Tristan Richardson: Helpful, thank you. And then just a follow-up as we think about the delevering cycle that kicks here and into 2021, any thoughts to updating the market on sort of long-term leverage target either you know, post year end 19 or beyond particular as we think of prospects for consolidating the debt because multiyear is out?
Jennifer Kneale: I think Christian that we've been consistently saying that a goal of ours is to reduce our leverage; we really let it move higher over the last couple years as we had given visibility to the ramp and cash flow and EBITDA from the project coming online. And now you're hearing us say that one of the reasons that were exploring some of the asset sales that we been successful on executing on is to more quickly to our leverage and so that's a big focus area for us. I think that because our leverage is where it is today a goal of four times consolidated over time is a reasonable assumption, but it's going to take some time to get there, just given where we are today even as our EBITDA ramps. And so we will be looking at debt co repurchase and the terms of those repurchases and our leverage as we move through time. We got great flexibility in that structure in terms of having four years from essentially the fourth quarter to take it out. So I think as we feel like we have a lot of options to use our additional cash flow as it generated.
Tristan Richardson: Thank you, guys, very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Christine Cho from Barclays. Your line is now open.
Christine Cho: Morning everyone. I wanted to start with your comments about increasing the fee-based cash flows. So when you say you're adding fee-based component and for or just outright off the, is it just for new volumes and there's nothing for existing volumes and if it is just renew volume would be fair to say that all of this contracting that you're talking about is primarily taking place in the Permian.
Joe Perkins: I would say it's a mix of new volumes and existing. So we have multiple contracts with our producers that are in different stages of life, some are relatively short term and some a longer term, but I would say it's a mix of growth volumes and existing volumes and you be corrected that most of it, I think will be taking place in the Permian but we also have some POP and some other commodity price sensitivity elsewhere, there is less activity, there's less opportunities for us to go in there and do that. We're going to those other areas as well. But it is primarily in the Permian.
Christine Cho: Okay great and then I wanted to just talk about Waha the basis I think back out even though Grand Prix is in service. And could you just confirm that you won't be exposed to the faces to share capacity on the line and we should think that your price realization is say less the tariff you're paying for your pipeline capacity.
Patrick McDonie: This is Patrick McDonie. I mean we obviously have a variety of different ways that we move gas from our assets in the Permian basis. GCX is just one of those obviously we have firm transportation on that pipeline or moving gas to [indiscernible]. We also have firm capabilities out of the basin on other pipelines. We really have a mix portfolio where we have firm sales at Waha to people with firm transportation take away. We have our own firm transport going west coming back east, going into Mexico, etcetera. So when we look across the portfolio, we feel very good about our capabilities of moving our gas a lot of it out of the basin some of it with some Waha realized price but most of that based on sales and other locations out of Waha.
Christine Cho: Okay, great. And then just one last question, so on Grand Prix you expect September to be the hit 200,000 barrels per day and it looks like you're tracking better at 230, is this just been acceleration bit timing of volume is 250,000 barrels still the right now to hit sometime in 2020, or could this be on the conservative side and was it more a function of volumes being better on your system or third party processing plan.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, I'd say when we gave the original $200,000, I'd say it was a conservative estimate. It was our first full month in service and so we wanted to make sure we felt we're going to be able to exceed that number that we gave. You saw volumes on our system sequentially increase in the Permian Midland in the Delaware, both of which helped drive some of that outperformance. I think it's a really across the board - it's across the Permian, it's our volumes and it is third party volumes as well. I think as you get into 2020, I think we - we'll give some updated volume guidance or we anticipate giving some updated volume guidance in 2020, which will include Grand Prairie. I think we feel really good about our previous $250,000 at some point in 2020. We'll be bringing that - we'll be updating that in February. But yes, we feel really good about being able to exceed that.
Christine Cho: Great, thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Michael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So you kind of broadly referenced this early in your comments, but I'm wondering if you could talk a little more directly about what you're hearing from your producer customers in various basins that you operate, just to get a feel for just how much of a slowdown do you anticipate overall or are you really not seeing it because we seem to be hearing kind of mixed messages from the midstream side.
Patrick McDonie: Yes. This is Pat and I'll address that. Obviously, our biggest capital spends in the Permian Basin and our biggest growth over the past several years now has been in the Permian Basin. And obviously, we've employed a lot of capital there in the recent past, and those contracts and that activity level is underpinned by the large majors and the large independents. Certainly, we do have some smaller guys that may be more impacted by a slowdown, but generally, if you look at what we've done in the last nine months in the Delaware and Permian, we're 30% increase year on year on the nine-month look. Would we expect a 30% increase with rigs down roughly 16% year on year? Probably not a 30% increase, but a substantial increase. Our Delaware volumes obviously are coming off a smaller base. We would expect continued growth there. The activity level and the commitment of those producers is - we've got a good line of sight on them and we see that activity level being high. The Midland side, you know who our producers are; you've seen their public releases. They have drill bit committed to drilling on the Midland side of the basin, we expect robust growth there. So is there some slow down on some areas? Yes. Is it materially impacting us? Not at all. We see a lot of robust growth. And the good part about it is all of that growth really hits our fully integrated stream. It's coming through our GMP plants and it's all stuff that's going to get into Grand Prairie and down to Belleview and to our export terminal. So it looks fantastic for 2020 for us right now when we look at it.
Joe Bob Perkins: And just to add one point to that, Pat, an increasing share of our growth is from the majors and large independents too. As the Delaware ramps and as we ramp our growth, it is increasingly tied to the major large independents who move rigs a little bit slower than some of the smaller guys.
Michael Blum: Okay, got it. Second question is as you are adding here a fair amount of new frack capacity and expanding your LPG export dock, can you just speak to any trend in rate you're seeing there? I mean are you seeing rates hold steady? Are they going up? Down? Just wanted to get a feel for that. And then kind of related to that, if you could give us your updated views on just global LPG demand as you're around dock. Thank you.
Scott Pryor: This is Scott. And when you look at it on the frack side, we are recognizing that our expansion that we have on the frack side is supported by contracts that Pat referred to on the upstream side that is related to those larger companies, the larger independents as well. When we look at the fractionation business, it is highly supported by that in our integrated platform. It's not only feeding upstream; it's feeding through our Grand Prairie pipeline and ultimately into our frack station business and all the way down to the dock. There's been some talk of late that we have seen on the frack side, some increase in spot rates on fractionation. I would say that we are highly focused in on operating our fractionation basis around the secured contracts we have and performing for those producers in and to our frack. Even though we've seen some increases in that on a spot basis, it's not the frenzy that you saw this same time last year. And again, we are managing our inventories and looking forward to Train 7 coming online in the first quarter. And again, as Jen said in her comments, seeing that that will be highly utilized because we've got good transparency to the market in the forward months. On the export side of the business, again, we will benefit and we're already seeing benefits across our dock relative to the refurbishment of our Dock 2 that was announced - that we said that we've completed, that we'll see benefit of that in the fourth quarter, which from primarily de-bottle necks us on the butane side of our business. The market is strong. We're seeing opportunities out there. We are highly contracted today and I think we'll continue to benefit from that going forward. And again, it links us up relative to what we export across our dock as highly tied to what our fractionation growth business looks like as well as how that is tied all the way back into our GMP. And don't forget we've also got another expansion that'll be completed in the third quarter of next year, which is adding additional refrigeration, which steps us up to roughly from 10 million barrels a month today to 15 million barrels sometime in the third quarter of next year.
Michael Blum: Great, thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to pick up the comments you said earlier about getting to 80% de-based being kind of your expectation for 2020, and was just wondering if that was an average for the year or did that continue to kind of progress over the years, the rates are higher, or is there any ability to kind of keep nudging that number up? I mean it seems like that's a pretty big step change versus where TRGP has been historically. So just wanted to start there.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, that 80% is an average, but we see it continuing maybe not in a straight line, but continuing up and to the right. So that fee-based percentage should just continue to increase over time. So I would expect the back half of the year to be higher fee-based percentage than earlier, but that is an annual average.
Jeremy Tonet: And I guess for the open exposure at this point, how do you guys think about hedging? And I'm not sure if you touched on how much you've locked in for 2020 as of now.
Jennifer Kneale: We're hedged over 50% across all commodities for 2020, Jeremy, and I think that we're very much focused on cash flow stability as our leverage is higher and begins to work down. And so you've seen us add a significant number of hedges really in the back half of this year, and I would expect that that would continue.
Jeremy Tonet: That's helpful, thanks. And just was curious if the agencies had kind of taken notice of this and how this kind of impacts your standings there, given how the business has been changing over time.
Jennifer Kneale: We continue to try to have a very active dialogue with the agencies, make sure there are no surprises there. So delivering on the forecast that we show them, delivering on the asset sales that we tell them we expect to have, making sure that we're just delivering on all fronts. And so that's an ongoing dialogue, and we expect that the continued growth of our business in terms of fee-based margin, asset diversity, et cetera will only help us in those dialogues.
Jeremy Tonet: That's helpful. That's it from me. Thanks.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks, Jeremy.
Operator: The next question comes from Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Keith Stanley: Hi. I just wanted to clarify any early thoughts on the funding plan for the CapEx budget next year. I think in the prepared remarks, you said no common equity. Should I think mainly asset sales to execute on? Would you consider preferred equity or mainly debt financing of the CapEx?
Jennifer Kneale: We benefit from increasing cash flow and EBITDA and have very good visibility to that, so that provides us with additional debt capacity plus more internally generated cash flow. So I think you've seen us through 2019 each quarter deliver more strongly the message just as our business has performed that we do not have expectations to need to issue any equity over the foreseeable future. As Matt said, we've got the assets that we've already executed in terms of asset sales. We've got the one that we announced this morning with the Permian Delaware crude business, and the only active asset sale other than that that's underway, which is in the early stages, is a potential sale of the Midland side of the Permian crude business. And that's really all that we're expecting at this point.
Keith Stanley: Okay. And just to clarify, the $1.2 to $1.3 billion net: is that the same of the gross number or is that the net of some of the asset sales or any project financing?
Jennifer Kneale: That's net of all of our partnerships so that's what Targa's expected spending is relative to all the growth projects that we have visibility to for 2020.
Keith Stanley: Okay. And then - sorry, go ahead.
Jennifer Kneale: Sorry. I was just going to add that it doesn't include any potential asset sales or anything like that. It's the pure spending for growth capital on projects that we have visibility to.
Keith Stanley: Okay, great. And one last small one. You said you sold the Delaware crude gathering business for I think it was $135 million. Can you just remind me the size of the Midland gathering relative to the Delaware on crude?
Jennifer Kneale: So, current operating margin on the Midland size of the crude business is higher than it is on the Delaware side, but we're not going to provide any more detail at this point, given we're just really kicking off the potential evaluation of the sale of the Midland crude assets.
Keith Stanley: Great. That's it for me. Thank you.
Jennifer Kneale: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question from [indiscernible] from Jeffries. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Jen, I guess relative to our modeling, we saw a nice sequential improvement in the GMP operating costs this quarter, a sizable decline from last quarter. I guess I'm just curious of any additional color the drivers and the sustainability of that improvement.
Jennifer Kneale: I think that our operating team, particularly in the Permian where we've been spending a lot of capital and we've been bringing a lot of assets, and the service has been very much focused on reducing operating expenses, and I applaud them for those efforts. We mentioned on our second quarter call that we were putting an AGI well into service as well this summer, which is going to help reduce our chemical cost. So part of that is what you're seeing in the third quarter but this is a big area focus for us, Chris, along with capital discipline, managing our costs OpEx as well and G&A, is a big point of focus across the organization. And so this is consistent with our expectation in terms of Q3 being lower than the second quarter. The second quarter, we also had the reclass of some G&A into OpEx as well, so that was sort of more one-timey in nature. And I would expect that we will continue to remain very much focused on this, and what we're mostly focused on is having reduced per unit costs as volumes are continuing to ramp across our GMP businesses and also our downstream business.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And congrats on the quick sale in Delaware. I suppose that speaks to both the quality of the asset and the banking team involved. And good luck on the Midland side. I'm curious: with those assets and those - you've mentioned some more that are pending perhaps and then the recent pull back on producer activity, how much it impacts anticipated maintenance activities in the future. Any meaningful toggle we should expect on that front?
Jennifer Kneale: I wouldn't expect a meaningful toggle in terms of our maintenance spending. We've also placed a lot of new assets in service, but new assets don't require a lot of maintenance. But no, I wouldn't expect that there's a big step change that's about to occur there up or down.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then I just have one final - it's more of a clarification point on questions earlier. And Christine had asked about the fee and commodity mix of the business and efforts to grow the fee stream. I think in response to Jeremy, you said that you're still planning to hedge the open commodity exposure to ensure cash flow stability in your hedge stuff 50% for next year. Could you just remind me of any internal hurdles or targets that you have to be hedged a certain percentage at a certain time?
Jennifer Kneale: Our general targets, as we work with the risk committee of the board of directors is to hedge 75% for the next 12 months out, 50% for the 12 months after that, 25% for the 12 months after that. Those are the general guidelines. And then within those general guidelines on a quarterly basis we're working with the risk committee to figure out the appropriate tolerance for hedges within Targa.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. But your point at this point is that those are unlikely to change even as the business become more fee, you still think that's still a good target for us to at least assume?
Jennifer Kneale: I think that's a fine target for now. You've seen us hedge more when we've been given the opportunity higher than those thresholds or at the same time have also hedged left in those levels when there has been something in the market that has sort of driven that decision making. So we'll continue to be flexible, but those are our targets and I don't see those changing in the near term.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. All right. Thanks a lot for the time this morning.
Operator: And the last question from [indiscernible] from Seaport Global Securities, your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Couple of ones from me. Can you talk about transitioning from commodity to fee-based contracts on the POP side? I was wondering if you could talk about is there any kind of level of commodity prices with those - this transition is kind of leveling your total Targa?
Joe Bob Perkins: When we're discussing with the producers, we're really looking at when we put capital out getting it all in return on capital. So we're targeting if we start with the fee-based contracted at what speed we need to earn an appropriate gathering and processing return on capital and that's where we start. And if they want to make the piece of that into POP or do a hybrid or floor we're flexible with all the things, we've done some of those things, it less about us agreeing on a commodity price, and where we get revenue neutral and more over range of scenarios them understanding we need to have an adequate return or at least price more protection to spend that capital.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay second question I had related to the lowering of OpEx in Q3 versus Q2, I think Jen mentioned some of the evaluation and on the property taxes, which helps that take down, I was wondering how frequently is that the property taxes valuation done.
Jennifer Kneale: Well what happens at the beginning of the year we make, an estimate on our taxes and as we move through the year and we have numbers or better visibility to numbers that we expect to be realized, we change that estimate. So generally start every year on the gathering and processing and down streaming size with our high estimate then as we move through the year and that estimate becomes again even more realize or we have more visibility to what it's going to be it tends to come down. So that's really just the pattern that we generally have year in and year out for [indiscernible] taxes.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay got it and then just last one for me on the export side, could you indicate what's the rough breakdown between the propane export and the beauty exports that you're seeing currently?
Patrick McDonie: We have not given that it is moving more towards butane or its historically or I really need you to go back over a number of years have been kind of 8020 Scott, we been closer to 30% or even more so on butane.
Joe Bob Perkins: We've seen that increase overtime again pointed back to the projects that we have focused in on bolt on type projects that have debottleneck around the butane side. So I think over time you will see that gradually increase with more focus on butane and that helps us also optimize on the upside, how much volume we would actually see across the dock.
Jennifer Kneale: You can see in our investor presentations, we provide a breakdown of the propane, butane mix of what already been loaded at the facility.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, got it. Thanks guys and congrats on a good quarter.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Sanjay Lad.

We plan to continue to progress our disclosures in these areas as we move forward. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks Sanjay. Good morning everyone. Before we get into our prepared remarks this morning. I want to take a moment to mention our recently announced planned executive succession and management transition. As described in the press release effective March 1, 2020 Matt will become the Chief Executive Officer and will be elected to the Board of Directors. At the same time, I will become Executive Chairman of the Board and will remain as a member of the management team and Jim Whelan our current Executive Chairman will retire from the management team and will continue to serve on the Board of Directors. These changes early next year will continue the succession and transition in leadership, long contemplated and developed under target ongoing management succession plan. Of course, developed with an approved by Targa's Board of Directors. Matt is ready for and largely already performing his next role. And I look forward to continuing to work with him, the Executive Team and Targa's Board of Directors as Executive Chairman. On behalf with the entire Targa's team, I want to take this opportunity to thank Jim Whelan for his dedicated service and invaluable contributions on the management team and as a member of our Board across Targa's history. It is a privilege to work alongside Jim. Although it is hard for me to imagine Jim not being a part of the management team, we expect to continue to benefit from his wisdom as a readily accessible and highly interested Board member. So, kicking off the prepared remarks. It continues to be a special time at Targa with multiple important growth projects recently online and we look forward to increasing cash flow contributions from these highly strategic assets now online. Especially important our Grand Prix NGL pipeline, which just started flowing NGLs all the way to Mont Belvieu. We announced that we were building Grand Prix more than two years ago and is the largest and clearly most strategic single project in Targa’s history now having the pipeline in service as the realization of our integrated vision and a lot of hard work by many Targa people. Thank you to everyone who has been involved in the key project for Targa, it really underpins our excitement about the near-term and along - for our Company. With our premier assets customer reputation in both our gathering and processing business and our downstream NGL business with the Grand Prix pipeline further integrating those businesses and with talented leadership and employees Targa is exceedingly well positioned for the future. With that, I will now turn it over to Matt.
Matthew Meloy: Thanks Robert and good morning. It is certainly an exciting time at Targa as we begin to benefit from cash flows associated with our significant investment cycle. These projects are coming online at a good time when the outlook for our commercial activity and production in many of our operating regions remained robust. Since the end of the first quarter, we have had the busiest and most productive period in Targa's history in terms of bringing on an aggregate gross value of about three billion of projects online, including Grand Prix pipeline, Fractionion Train 6, Hopson Plant, Little Missouri 4 Plant and the Pembrook Plant. Grand Prix has commenced full operations and have consistently flowed between 150, 000 and 170,000 barrels per day, first filling the pipeline and now flowing into Mont Belvieu. We expect these volumes to increase to approximately 200,000 barrels per day in September then further increase throughout the rest of the year as short-term third party transport arrangements continue to roll-off and as additional GMP facilities come online. Overall, Grand Prix came online, with about two months of delay versus our initial announcement timing provided over two years ago and about 10% over budget. Most of the delay and cost overrun was related to this year's construction of the 30-inch line in East Texas that flows into Mont Belvieu. This delay and related cost overrun was largely caused by longer permitting timing as well as weather related construction delays, primarily for much heavier than normal rainfall at critical times. Even with the increased overall cost for Grand Prix, our estimated returns are significantly higher than when we announced the project. As we have continued to add significant long-term acres contracts and CNF contracts, further strengthening the volume outlook for Grand Prix going forward. Moving to our gathering and processing business and beginning in the Badlands, we recently commenced operations of our new 200 million cubic feet per day Little Missouri 4 plant, providing much needed relief given our system has been operating at capacity. The plant is expected this quickly ramp through the balance of this year has incremental NGL take away capacity when the basin comes online. The final costs associated with LM 4 was roughly 30 million higher than originally estimated as a result of the shift and project timing, but again, given the strong outlook for volumes, we estimate our returns are at least as good as when we announced the project. Moving to the Permian, we are seeing volumes from the Midland Basin, even above our expectations so far this year. We commenced operations of our new 250 million cubic feet per day Hopson Plant in late April, and the facility is already operating at capacity. Our next 250 million cubic feet per day Pembrook Plant is starting up and is expected to be highly utilized. Given the volume growth that we are seeing across the Midland Basin, we are moving forward with our next new 250 million cubic feet per day plant named Gateway and anticipate that we will be online in the fourth quarter of 2020. Capital associated with a Gateway plant was previously included in our initial 2019 net growth CapEx guidance. And as we go forward, we expect our integrated NGL business will generate higher returns than we have experienced in the past as the NGLs from new plants will largely be transported down Grand Prix and to our Mount Bellevue fractionation complex. In the Delaware, we remain on-track to complete our 250 million cubic feet per day Falcon plant in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the 250 million cubic feet per day Paragon plant is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2020. While our Permian residue gas exposure is substantially hedged in 2019, weak Waha Natural gas pricing during the second quarter weighed on our realized natural gas prices for those volumes un-hedged. Fortunately, we are seeing the residue gas landscape in the Permian Basin improve with the Gulf Coast Express pipeline on-track to begin full operation by the end of the third quarter. Turning to our downstream business, our fractionation facilities in Mount Bellevue continue to remain highly utilized during the second quarter. Our new Train 6 fractionators which commenced operations in May quickly ramps the capacity. Construction continues on Train 7 and Train 8, which are expected to be online late first quarter and late third quarter of 2020 respectively. We expect both frack trains to be highly utilized at startup based on our expectation of rapidly growing NGL volumes from Grand Prix and contracted third-parties. In our LPG export business, we are on-track to complete the rebuild of Dock 2 at the end of the third quarter of this year. Our next phase of export expansion at our Galena Park facility remains on-track as well and will increase our effective capacity to approximately 11 million to 15 million barrels per month in the third quarter of 2020. We remain focused in executing on our strategic priorities to increase longer term shareholder value. I want to recognize our talented and dedicated employees across the Company who continue to safely operate our infrastructure facilities every day. With the completion of Grand Prix combined with the completion of a number of gathering and processing and downstream expansion projects year-to-date, the trajectory of our CapEx spend will substantially moderate and we expect 2020, net growth CapEx to be meaningfully lower in 2019. Additionally, we continue to thoroughly evaluate and highly scrutinize all future new capital project to align capital spend with available cash flow going forward. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jen to discuss Targa's results for the second quarter.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks, Matt good morning everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $307 million, which was about $7 million lower than the first quarter of 2019 as a result of the sale of the 45% interest in the Badlands which closed in April 3rd. Overall, strong fundamentals for Targa's gathering and processing and downstream business led by higher sequential volumes in the Permian region, higher fractionation volumes and LPG export volumes would have resulted in higher sequential adjusted EBITDA if not for the Badlands sale. In the G&P segment operating margin contribution from higher sequential inlet volumes led by our Permian midland and Permian Delaware region was offset by the impact of lower NGL and natural gas prices. NGL prices trough to historic low during the second quarter, net of realized hedge gains second quarter gross margin was only about $3 million higher than the first quarter as a result of those prices. In our logistics and marketing segment operating margin sequentially increased due to higher volumes from start up of Train 6, higher marketing opportunities which contributed roughly $10 million in the second quarter, and which I would characterize as more one-time in nature and higher LPG export volume. In addition to pipeline transportation margins from the start up portion of Grand Prix. Our G&P and downstream operating expenses increased in the second quarter over the first quarter from additional assets and system expansion primarily in the Permian where labor costs have been increasing and also from a re-class of certain G&A expenses to operating expense. Our G&A decreased in the second quarter versus the first quarter. Looking forward, we are very focused on managing our operating and G&A expenses and expected begin to see our per-unit operating expenses decreased overtime as utilization of recently completed projects increases and we benefit from the new AGI well and our Wildcat facilities in Delver which should reduce chemical cost that have been increasing to treat Targa gas. While there has been obvious plus and minuses year-to-date, our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance range $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion remains unchanged. Some of the larger headwinds that we have faced so far this year include lower NGL and Waha crisis, the shift in Grand Prix completion to August, the shift the Little Missouri 4 plant completion in the Bakken into August, lower South Texas inlet volumes and higher operating expenses, particularly in G&P. On the positive side, some of the some of the pluses have been higher frack volumes and marketing opportunities, and higher Permian inlet volumes. I would also like to point out that our non-controlling interest cut back is increasing and expected to continue to increase given the ramp up in Train 6 and Grand Prix, which is a deduction for partnership ownership interest to align with Targa's reported adjusted EBITDA. Currently hedging, our percent of proceeds equity commodity positions are well hedged as we continue to execute additional hedges to increase cash flow stability, particularly for the back half of 2019. Our updated hedge disclosures can be found in our investor presentation. On a debt compliance basis, TRPs leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was approximately 4.4 times versus a compliance covenants of 5.5 times. We continue to expect our compliance leverage to peak in the third quarter and then begin to come down rapidly. In early June, we executed an amendment for TRP credit facilities to utilize greater benefits by EBITDA contribution from our projects in progress, but not yet in service, which successfully increased our flexibility and also resulted in lower compliance leverage, which reduces our borrowing cost as it puts TRP in a lower pricing tier. Our consolidated reported debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 5.3 times. Our 2019, net growth CapEx estimate for announced projects is now expected to be approximately $2.4 billion, which represents a 4% increase compared to our initial estimates. We have spent about $1.4 billion of net growth CapEx through the first half of this year. As Matt described earlier, project costs associated with both Grand Prix and LM 4 were higher than initially estimated. Additionally, over the last 12 months, we have seen labor costs move higher, and now forecast that a new 250 million cubic feet per day Permian plant costs approximately $160 million. We continue to remain highly focused on our capital spend, and are working diligently across the organization to manage CapEx for 2019 and all future new capital projects. Our full-year 2019 maintenance CapEx forecast remains unchanged at approximately $130 million. No common equity has been issued year-to-date and based on current market conditions, our expectation is we may not need to issue any equity into the foreseeable future, as we benefit from increasing cash flow and lower leverage from our projects now in service. Looking prior to the second half of this year, we expect adjusted EBITDA and dividend coverage to be highest during the fourth quarter, as we benefit from full quarter contribution from a number of recently completed growth projects, providing - with significant momentum towards improving metrics as we exit 2019. The trajectory of our capital spending relative to our cash flow is improving and we are spending a lot of time in pulling an enhanced top down focused approach to control feature CapEx, prioritize future investments around our core strategy, which is to maximize participation across Targa’s integrated value-chain. We are at a key inflection point within past second quarter where our spending peaked as a result of our strategic growth CapEx program and the final Permian earn out payment and with our EBITDA at lowest point of the year as a result of the Badlands partial interest sale. Now moving through the third quarter, where we benefit from some partial quarter contributions from key assets, lower growth capital spending and then moving into fourth quarter when we will demonstrate rapidly increasing EBITDA and dividend coverage with lower growth capital spending and improving leverage metrics. With that, I would like to turn it back to Matt, for a few closing comments.
Matthew Meloy: Thanks Jen. We have accomplished a lot and we still have a lot of work ahead of us. So I want to thank all the Targa employees who have been working very hard to complete the important strategic project that have recently come online. And thank you to all of the operations and support organization employees that have prepared for and are now handling the new facility’s expanded volumes. This is an exciting time at Targa, great project coming online and strong outlook ahead. So with that operator please open the line for questions.
Operator: Sure. Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis from Crédit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Spiro Dounis: Hey good morning everyone. Maybe just starting with CapEx, hey Matt. Starting with CapEx very encouraging comments around and it sounds like we have essentially hit the peak here. I know sometimes some of your peers maybe talk to shadow backlogs and you guys have held pretty firm to that 1.8 billion of CapEx across 2020, 2021, which does assume things get down from here. Just anything sizable in the backlog that you are working on now that could increase that spend in 2020 and as we are close to 2020 any sense you can give us in terms of what percentage that 1.8 billion could hit?
Joe Bob Perkins: Sure. Yes we are obviously working very hard to keep 2019 CapEx, we actually worked very hard to keep it at the 2.3, but with the cost over around it, it moved to 2.4. As we look out the kind of capital that we have been describing as adding additional fractionation train, which now in Train 7 and Train 8 that is obviously going to be capital that is spent next year, adding additional processing plants, adding the Gateway plant. We got the Falcon plant out in the Delaware, the Peregrine plant. I would say as we look out kind of over the near-term what we see in terms of capital spending is more normal. Capital spending associated with our core integrated strategy which is gathering and processing, largely going to be in the Permian basin and then additional fractionation and export those projects are for the most part already announced and included in what we are planning for 2020.
Spiro Dounis: Great. That is helpful and then just a follow-up on Grand Prix and thinking about the ramp up there. How should we think filling that pipeline up from here, I guess more specifically what processing plants are going to be connected into that and do you benefit from NGL coming off in some of the third-party pipeline on to Grand Prix.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, exactly. We are going to benefit from really both of those items going forward. One we will have shorter-term transportation agreement that we had entered into to move NGLs while Grand Prix was being built. So those are going to continue to roll off. So we will be able to continue to just move volumes off other pipes onto Grand Prix, but we are also going to benefit from our new gathering and processing plant being put in place as most of those NGL are going to be pointed towards Grand Prix and then into our fractionation and export. So we will be benefiting on it really from the full value chain as new processing plants gets put online.
Spiro Dounis: Great. I appreciate all that color. Thanks everyone.
Joe Bob Perkins: Alright. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is open.
Shneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning everyone. Maybe to start off, first of all I just wanted to offer my congratulations to both Joe Bob and Matt on your new roles.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you. I appreciate it.
Matthew Meloy: Thank you.
Shneur Gershuni: Just in terms of - a couple quick questions, maybe to follow-up on Spiro's question here, just when in starting with CapEx, when you talk about a meaningful reduction in CapEx for 2020. Are we talking in the neighborhood of greater than 50%, because the numbers are kind of split over two years, is it more 2020 versus 2019. And then you also talked about some cost over runs, but also last call you talked about moving some of the in-service paid for some of your facilities to capture some labor costs benefits. Is it too early to see some of those benefits, just wondering if you can talk about those trends?
Jennifer Kneale: Sure. It is Jen. I think that from our perspective, it's premature to roll out 2020 direct sort of CapEx guidance as we did in February for 2019. What we provided last November was meant to be really instructive. It was a point in time forecast that really I think directionally demonstrates that at that point in time, what we felt like our CapEx budget would be reduced to over 2020 and 2021. We are very much focused on reducing CapEx on a go forward basis, certainly expect 2020 to be absolutely substantially lower than 2019. But we do think just that there is a lot changing, think about everything that has changed as we move through this year, that it is a little premature for us to come out with a direct sort of hard and fast number that we will certainly be holding ourselves to in 2020.
Shneur Gershuni: In the cost spends, in terms of starting projects later, talk about [CapEx] (Ph) benefits on that?
Jennifer Kneale: I think you have seen that we shifted some frack timing. So the timing of Train 8, which we shifted on our last earnings call. You see with the announcement of the Gateway plant that really on the Midland basin side volumes have exceeded our expectations. And so while we expected that we will be moving forward with that plant this year, maybe a little bit sooner than expected with the announcement today. And, so I think that when we look out across our portfolio of future sort of capital projects, to Matt's point, it feels like it is going to be very much across the core value chain. I think it will be totally easy for you to forecast when we will be adding plants and fracks just as a result of the volume growth that you are seeing across Targa, because of the integrated value chain that means as we bring on new plants, those volumes will have to go to new fracks, and so I think it would be easy for you to forecast the associated spending and timing of when we will need new facilities.
Joe Bob Perkins: I think Shneur you have also described the ongoing discipline that the team is using. Yes, pushing the frack trains out a little bit for it saves some labor costs. And yes, we announced the Gateway that is right about on time, not pushing it out, because the volumes are causing that. That is the disciplined framework that the management team is using.
Shneur Gershuni: That makes sense and I appreciate that follow-up Joe Bob. And just with the new assets coming online a lot of them are fee based in nature. Can you give us a sense of where your commodity exposures sort of ends up as a result like, from the to and from type of scenario. And there any opportunities to further reduce exposure either by selling assets or restructuring the contract?
Jennifer Kneale: I think this year we forecast about 75% of our operating margin to be fee based churn and when we think about assets that has been placed in service such as Grand Prix additional frack trains, the plants out in the Delaware, certainly we are moving to a more fee-based model and that I think will become very obvious in our results really beginning in the fourth quarter and then going forward. I think that we are continuing to look across our portfolio of assets to figure out where there are opportunities to move less away from commodity price exposed contracts and more to fee based contracts and we will be continuing to do that. But that is really a practice that we have had within Targa going on for years now. And so that will continue. I think when you think the complexion of our assets in contrast, in the Midland basin where we have got largely a lot of our POP exposure, we are trying to make those contracts more fee-based or at least have more fee-based elements there and expect that would continue, but that is a slow process. So I would expect that our fee based margin will increase going forward 2020 over 2019, 2021 over 2020, et cetera, but it won’t be a sort of a monumental one-time shift that gets us to largely entirely fee-based.
Shneur Gershuni: That make sense. Final question, at the export our LPG has been extremely wide, obviously of the new facility coming online. Have you been able to use the wide nature of the spread right now to like login system more longer term contracts to more capture some of that spread.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes. I will turn it over to Scott to handle that one.
Scott Pryor: Yes, basically we have seen through the first quarter and second quarter, there were some tightness in the export markets, some of that was related to some challenges that the Houston ship channel was facing due to some fires and some issues that they had. So we were playing a little bit of catch up during the second quarter, but now that we had kind of cleared that opportunity, we are excited to see the revamping of our Dock 2 which will come online during the third quarter of this year and the of course our refrigeration unit that come online in the third quarter of next year. So though we have had limited opportunities to match up the larger art that was present at times. We do think that, given the opportunities with the expansion projects that we have got underway the bottleneck projects that we gone under over the last several quarters to include assets added to our building facility to debottleneck butane as well as our pipeline down Galena Park. These will provide further opportunities for us to participate when those ARB opportunities are present. We are very comfortable where we are on our term contract basis and look forward to when that present itself in the future.
Shneur Gershuni: Perfect. Thank you very much guys. I really appreciate the color today.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colton Bean from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open.
Colton Bean: Good morning. The labor discussion on the capital program, but I think in that 2020 and 2021 forecast there is an assumption around three potential Permian plants, so we have Gateway being slated for Q4 2020, does that imply that there would be two plants in 2021 or should we think that maybe there is one of those things can move into 2022?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes. So we are still working through timing, on both the Midland basin and on the Permian side. You know we have already got two announced sort of yet to come on the Delaware side of things. So there is potentially another point in that timeframe out in Delaware potentially and so there could be potentially another plant point on the Midland side. So I think that is still a reasonable estimate, having three plants come online in that timeframe, but again talk about - we are still really working through going over producer volumes forecast, moving that into our forecasts and trying to stage so the plants at that is a correct time.
Colton Bean: Got it. That is helpful. And then just we focus express starting-up in about a month and a half. Can you clarify for us what sort of uplift that has on your commodity margin. So understanding that you have the equity interest, but when you look at your POP natural gas exposure, what does that do for you in our Q4?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, I mean, really, for us having GCX online, we are going to benefit much like the producers are going to benefit which is higher Waha prices out in the Permian. So you saw our realizations, relatively low producers have the same effect here, recently, prices are still low. So we are greatly looking forward to GCX coming online, and we will see higher Waha prices, which will benefit us on the equity side of our volumes.
Colton Bean: And would - effectively 100% of your equity volumes be covered by GCX or should we still assume that there is a little bit of end dates on there?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, so it will be a mix. It's not necessarily going to be all transported down GCX. But our equity volumes will benefit, even if they are not moving down GCX just from the uplift in Waha prices from GCX.
Colton Bean: Got it. I appreciate the time.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks Colt.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Keith Stanley: Hi good morning.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hey, good morning.
Keith Stanley: I wanted to clarify first just with the good second quarter here, that you feel good on the EBITDA guidance for the year even using current commodity assumptions over the balance of the year?
Jennifer Kneale: We reaffirmed our guidance for the year and we have gout - the first half of the year is completed. And now as we move through the third quarter with Grand Prix coming online. We didn't think that it made sense for us to change our guidance. We are not expecting to change our annual guidance on a quarterly basis anyway. So, I think we detailed some of the headwinds that we have faced as we move through the year and we have got, some of the tailwinds as well. And now with Grand Prix online, feel very, very good about our fourth quarter contribution of Grand Prix to our EBITDA, increasing cash flow from other assets as utilization increases. So, really just reaffirming what is out there.
Keith Stanley: Okay, and one follow-up on LPG exports. So, will you have 10 million barrels per month of capacity in the fourth quarter? And are there any bottlenecks to sort of filling that and ramping that higher pretty quickly in the fourth quarter on exports. And, I just want to clarify, it sounds like you have a little bit more exposure to the ARBs, once these expansions come online, just in the earlier question wanted to make sure I heard that right. Thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: Well, what I would say is, again, we were highly utilized during the second quarter, we moved about seven million barrels per month during the second quarter, somewhere around 231,000 barrels a day. Our focus continues to be to complement our export business as it relates to our overall platform our G&P business that feeds into Grand Prix that feeds in - and through our storage, through our fractionation business. And then all the way down to our dock for Galena Park for exports. As I said earlier, the projects that we took and underway to the bottlenecks the facility, a lot of those projects were geared more towards butane, our ability to export butane at higher volumes. So depending upon what the mixture is of propane's and butanes we will kind of dictate whether or not we are hitting the nine million or 10 million barrels of export volumes during the fourth quarter. Once we enhance that even more with refrigeration unit in the third quarter of next year. That provides us even further opportunities. So we were highly utilized, most of that was related to term business. So I would not say that were exposed what the ARB is because we have got fee base related contracts that are going to flow in though our business and so the volumes have to move offshore when you think about incremental volumes of production of propane and butane.
Keith Stanley: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson from SunTrust. Your line is now open.
Tristan Richardson: Hey good morning guys. Now that you have got substantially more visibility on Grand Prix and Train 6 and GCX tracking the schedule, can you talk about just sort of the plans to update the multi-year outlook with that enhanced visibility now.
Jennifer Kneale: I think that from our perspective we have left the long-term outlook slide in our materials, largely because we find it instructive. Particularly with those that are less familiar with Targa when we have an opportunity to talk about our growth capital program that has been underway that now many of those assets are online around, it’s an easy slide to point to. I don't think that we see it as necessary for us to continue to update a multiyear outlook. I mean if you think about all the plus and minus that I have even gone through today around what has happened in 2019, that is just a difficult endeavors to undertaken and putting out a multi-term outlook every quarter. And so I think Tristan, right now we are thinking that we will put our typical 2020 guidance around our normal timeframe, which would be in February which is when we have the optimal amount of information from producers to really I think effectively predict not only EBITDA, but capital for 2020 and that is really I think the tactic that will most likely take.
Tristan Richardson: Very helpful, thank you and then just on the capital deployment you guys have been very local, very clear with us that your assumption for substantially lower CapEx next year and when we think about governors of that, I mean is Dallas stronger governor than sort of your return hurdle metrics and criteria in other words, if something came along that was very strategic and very compelling is it that substantially lower sort of comments that drives your decision-making or is it more sort of how complementary your project might be?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, so good question and it is difficult as we are going through and allocating capital and trying to allocate the capital to the highest return projects. I think as Jen said, we are looking it at a top-down thing we are trying to move towards that free cash flow so we don't need to issue anymore equity and go towards free cash flow. So that is our starting point and then we look at what is the best use and how do we balance the capital between investing and gathering and processing projects and another projects in downstream. Our focus has been and really will continue to be what is along the core value chain, where we can earn margin on a gathering and processing side on transportation, fractionation and export. So those are the lenses that we are using as we think about growth capital into 2020 but we are starting with what financial metrics are we are going to try and hit in 2020 were reasonable targets that we can have to move towards that free cash flow as soon as possible.
Jennifer Kneale: And I think the Williams project that we announced earlier this year really highlights how we are thinking about the world of capital so that is a project that is incredibly strategic for us in terms of additional volumes on Grand Prix to our fractionation, but we approached it as it Williams, and what we both viewed as the most capital efficient way possible to get a very attractive deal done for both sides. But again, in a capital efficient manner.
Tristan Richardson: It makes sense. Thank you guys very much.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is [Rahul] (Ph) on for Jeremy. With 119 in the book, so could you update us on your second half outlook what those initial expectations and provide us your latest thoughts on what you are seeing in terms of producer equity and what it could mean for the exit rate?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, sure. I think, as we have said in the prepared comments, and I will just kind of reiterate maybe expand a little bit on those, we saw really good volumes on the G&P side across our Permian business. So we saw a good growth in the Midland side, really good growth sequentially on the on the Delaware side. I think as we look into the back half of the year, we would expect that strength to continue, as we are bringing on - Pembroke will be bringing on additional facilities here, and we are going to start-up on that plant, we have Falcon coming on. So, I think our outlook for the back half of the year, on the Permian side is continued strong growth, even exceeding our previous guidance, potentially there. So, I think we see really good growth on that side. And that is going to bode well for us on the Grand Prix volume as most of those volumes are headed towards Grand Prix into our fractionation and export.
Unidentified Analyst: Got you. That is a helpful color. On just going back to Grand Prix for a second, considering all the gives and takes on the pipe as it ramps and as the short-term contract so last, like are you guys are in a position to hit that to $250,000 barrels per day by mid-2020 targets, you guys stated before?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, so our previous guidance, there was 250 to 1,000 barrels at some point in 2020. We are not officially changing that, although sitting here, giving you guidance that we are going to be at 200,000 or so in September, I would say we feel really good about hitting that. And I feel good about hitting that kind of earlier in the year versus maybe the previous guidance we gave was later in the year, right, so as we are moving forward in time and feeling better about those volumes, our volume expectations kind of continue to increase on Grand Prix volumes.
Unidentified Analyst: Sounds good, that helps. And then like just a housekeeping question on the MTI, I think which kicked up notably you guys did talked about in the prepared remarks Grand Prix ramps, it could step-up, like is there any good indication of how we should look at it in the back half of the year?
Jennifer Kneale: I would suggest that you follow-up with Sanjay, obviously, the other ownership are disclosed related to Blackstone owning as 25% in Grand Prix, as well as the - that are in place. But we can walk you through all the steps associated with where that ought to increase just in terms of making sure that you are modeling our partnerships accurately and how that impacts the MCI cut back.
Unidentified Analyst: Sounds good. Thanks for taking my questions guys.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay. thank you.
Jennifer Kneale: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Danilo Juvane from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is opened.
Danilo Juvane: Good morning and thank you. Some producers in the Permian are talking about capital discipline so forth as it pertains to lower volume outlook going forward. But that is of course the crude. Is it fair to say that because of the highest GORs, you still see pretty solid growth even into 2020 and understanding that you don't give any guidance for 2020. But do you still see a sort of solid volumetric outlook out of the Permian?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, I'm going to turn it over to Pat to add, but I would say we expect continued growth in the Permian in 2020, the outlook there is still very good. Pat anything you want to -...
Patrick McDonie: Yes. I would echo the - I mean when we look at our core customers their balance sheet, their available capital to put to the drill bit. We feel really, really good about their continued activity level. As matter of fact we have line-of-sight on what they are doing the next six, 12-months and 18-months. So this has been huge surprised commodity price drop to alter that drilling schedule. We feel really, really good about our core producers and what volume going to look like.
Danilo Juvane: Thanks for that. And I guess as a follow-up. Do you see GCX immediately help to mitigate any flattering issues that you have seen out of Permian.
Joe Bob Perkins: Well there is flaring issues for a number of reasons. While the flaring issues tend to be even more local and could be related to the quality of gas whether it is H2S and others. So GCX may provide some relief to that, I would expect it alleviate all of it, because things are flared for different reasons. I think with us - everyone is producing gas out there, it’s going to be a welcome addition to capacity because we know Waha prices are hovering around zero, so we need that capacity online and we are going to benefit.
Danilo Juvane: Thank you and last question for me and - the update in the press release on the out rigor earn out. Obviously there is debt co payments to be 2023 and beyond and so forth, but with respect to the Bakken sales are there any payment that you guys would have to make as well. At the end of that deal or is that simply go find something higher cadence of distribution in early years that ultimately converse down to that 45% as the discussed previously.
Jennifer Kneale: It will be a latter, so there are no obligation for us to make any payments at any point in time beyond the minimum quarterly distribution and then what Blackstone will be entitled to as a result of the 45% interest.
Danilo Juvane: Oka. Thanks for that update Jen.
Jennifer Kneale: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] from Barclays. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys, good morning. I guess just first for me. I appreciate all the color so far on Grand Prix, it looks like based on what you are expecting today, maybe the volume that of your own processing plants that will we seeding into the pipe are on-track for maybe even better than what we expected, when you first announced the project, but you also have a number of third-parties on that pipe as well. Can you maybe just give us an update on how those volumes are trending relative to maybe original expectations and whether or not there any [MVC] (Ph) behind those.
Joe Bob Perkins: Sure. So it is a mix, so we have a multiple third-party I would say third-party dedications, multiple third-party MVCs on that. Depending on the producer, we have seen, I would say volume coming on not as fast as early indications when we were contracting that pipe, which is not unusual when you are getting forecasts from customers. But overall, the outlook in some of the cases catches up or even exceed as you move forward in time. But again it’s a diverse customer base. We have many customers and it’s a mix. So our volumes are going I would say even above expectations and in aggregate we have added more contracts than we estimate so even if those contracts are slightly under the volume forecast they gave us, they are still more third-party than we originally anticipated when we announced Grand Prix.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. I appreciate that thank you. And the next for me I guess, now that you have the full NGL pipeline, you have more of an integrated value chain than you did even just a year or two ago, I guess we kind of thought of it as the lack of the pipeline was, you know, the hole in the value chain in that part of your business. So should we think about the way that you operate commercially going forward without being different? I guess maybe what I mean by that is, should we look for you guys to take more advantage of some marketing opportunities, Contango and NGL, price, anything like that?
Joe Bob Perkins: I would say, we think it makes us more competitive. So when we are talking to the larger producers, we are able to offer the integrated suite of not only gathering and processing, but be able to handle the liquids all the way to the dock, and even through export. So, I think it makes us more competitive having the pipeline there. Anything Pat you want to add to that?
Patrick McDonie: Yes, I think once we announced Grand Prix, and we were sitting down with some of the larger production, opportunity capture opportunities in Delaware Basin. The fact that we were going to have Grand Prix going forward, that we would have a fully integrated platform, significantly added to our success. And planning some of those big dedications in those, capturing some of those larger opportunities. And quite frankly, that continues to be that way going forward. We are known as a very reliable G&P unit, we keep people's oil coming out of the ground and now the NGL interruptions et cetera, that we were afforded via having to rely on third-parties, we now have the ability to get around that. So, it's just another kind of added piece that our reliability and how we perform and provide service for our customers is enhanced that much further. So we feel really good about that and we are using it, and we will continue to use it.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you, that is all for me.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back to Sanjay Lad for any further comments.
Sanjay Lad: Thank you to everyone that was on the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. As a reminder, I will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thanks and have a great day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-07 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Targa Resources Corp First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the conference over to your host, Sanjay Lad, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Sanjay Lad: Thank you, Lavia. Good morning, and welcome to the first quarter 2019 earnings call for Targa Resources Corp. The first quarter earnings release for Targa Resources Corp., Targa, TRC or the company, along with the first quarter earnings supplement presentation are available on the Investors section of our website at targaresources.com. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. Any statements made during this call that might include the company's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the safe harbor provision of the Securities Act of 1933 and 1934. Please note that actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our recent SEC filings, including the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 and subsequently filed reports with the SEC. Our speakers for the call today will be Joe Bob Perkins, Chief Executive Officer; Jen Kneale, Chief Financial Officer and Matt Meloy, President. We will also have the following senior management team members available for Q&A: Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Marketing and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. Joe Bob will begin today's call with a few strategic highlights, followed by Jen, who will discuss first quarter results and then Matt will provide an update on business outlook and CapEx outlook before we take your questions. I'll now turn the call over to Joe Bob.
Joe Perkins: Thanks, Sanjay. Good morning. And thank you to everyone for joining the first quarter 2019 call. Before we get into our prepared remarks this morning, I would like to acknowledge the recent retirement of our friend, Mike Heim, effective April 30, consistent with the long-term succession planning the management team and our board of directors. As Targa's founding Chief Operating Officer, Mike had been involved in almost every major acquisition or major project and helped create and develop our operations engineering, S&H and commercial functions. Mike's impact on Targa has been enormous and will endure as we continue to build on our position as a leading mid-stream company. Most recently Mike served on the executive team as Vice Chairman of our Board of Directors and continued to provide oversight wisdom, advice and counsel. On behalf of the Targa team, we thank Mike for his role in founding this company and developing it into what it is today. It has been privilege to work alongside Mike throughout Targa's 15-year history. We will miss him, but he will always be part of the Targa's family legacy. So for this year, we have continued to execute on our strategic priorities including closing on the sale of the 45% interest in our Badlands business, commencing operations on our Hopson plant in the Permian Midland and Train 6 fractionators in Mont Belvieu and completing a new 20-inch pipeline for Mount Belvieu, our LPG export facility in Galena Park. Mount Belvieu 2, our LPG export facility in Galena Park, excuse me. We also have several other projects coming online this year including a Grand Prix NGL pipeline, 200 million cubic feet per day of incremental processing capacity in the Badlands, and 500 million cubic feet per day of incremental processing capacity in the Permian. In total, this means that about $3 billion of projects under way expected to come online this year, which will significantly strengthen our financial metrics over time as Targa moves to a self-lending model with increasing free cash flow. The natural trajectory of our capital spending relative to our cash flow is very positive and we have continued to increase scrutiny with heightened discipline and prioritization on all future new capital projects, so that we can continue to right size our capital spend versus cash flow going forward. We will continue to pursue opportunity to align officiated capital spend with the activity levels of our customers in a rigorously prioritizing our CapEx backlog with a heightened focus around our core integrated strategy. This enhances rigor around capital spending and strong expected cash flow growth positions Targa very well for the next several years. With that, I now turn the call over to Jen to discuss Targa's result for the first quarter.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks, Joe Bob. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $314 million which was $62 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2018, largely as a result of the $43 million payment recognition in the fourth quarter for the crude and condensates splitter. In the GMP segment, net of hedge gains, first quarter gross margin was $4 million lower from weaker commodity prices. First quarter NGL and Waha Natural gas prices were the weakest average realized prices we have experienced since the first quarter of 2016. Operating expenses were $13 million higher from increased field labor in the GMP segment, primarily in the Permian where labor costs have been increasing. We have reduced operational risks by hiring in advance of our facilities coming online which means that we have higher operating expenses per unit until our new facilities start up in utilization increases. Over time, we expect our operating expenses per unit to decline. On the positive side, sequential volumes were higher in the Permian, Badlands, and SouthOK, coastal and downstream in our frac business. Year-over-year, while volumes were significantly higher in our GMP and downstream businesses, positive business fundamentals were offset by lower commodity prices and higher operating and G&A expenses as headcount has increased significantly appropriately staff our increased scale. From January 1st, 2018 through the end of March, we have added about 400 employees, representing a 20% increase in headcount, which is evidenced by higher operating expenses in the G&A. But we expect our per unit OpEx and G&A metrics to improve over time, as volumes continue to ramp. Turning to other finance related matters. The final calculation of the earn out payment for our Permian acquisition is $318 million, which will be paid this month. With respect to hedging, our percent of proceeds equity commodity positions are well hedged and our updated hedged disclosures can be found in our investor presentation. On a debt compliance basis, pro forma for the $1.6 billion received in early April from the Badlands transaction, TRP's leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was approximately 3.9x versus a compliance covenant of 5.5x. Our pro forma consolidated reported debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 4.9x. As initially described on our call in February, our leverage metrics are expected to peak in the third quarter of 2019, and then will begin to decline as the EBITDA contribution increases from projects placed in service throughout the year. Our 2019 net growth CapEx estimate for announced projects remains at approximately $2.3 billion with about $780 millions spent through the first quarter. Full-year 2019 maintenance CapEx is still forecasted to be approximately $130 million. As previously announced, we closed on the sale of a 45% interest in our Badlands business, and received $1.6 billion of cash proceeds in early April. Pro forma consolidated liquidity at the end of the first quarter was approximately $3.4 billion. The partial Badland land sales substantially satisfies our estimated equity needs for 2019, providing us with flexibility, as we finish construction on the numerous key growth projects underway. Looking forward to the balance of the year, we affirm our previously provided financial and operational outlook for 2019, which assumes NGL composite barrel prices average $0.60 per gallon, crude oil prices averaged $54 per barrel, and Henry Hub natural gas prices average $3 per MMbtu for the year. We also affirm our expectation that second quarter adjusted EBITDA will be the lowest quarter of 2019, predominantly attributable to the Badlands sale and the associated minimum quarterly distribution payable to our partner. Additionally, we anticipate EBITDA to meaningfully increase through the second half of the year with Targa exiting 2019 with visibility to increasing dividend coverage and improving leverage metrics. With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt.
Matthew Meloy: Thanks, Jen, and good morning everyone. Commercial activity and production in many of our operating regions remain robust, and we expect activity levels to remain solid. In our Permian region, we expect continued production growth in 2019 across both the Midland and Delaware basins. In Permian Midland, we commenced operations on our new 250 million cubic feet per day Hopson Plant in late April, and the facility is already highly utilized. The next 250 million cubic feet per day Pembroke plant is expected to begin operations early in the third quarter. In Permian Delaware, a substantial portion of the new high pressure pipeline running through the heart of the Delaware is operational, underpinned by our deal with a large investment grade energy company. Additionally, our 250 million cubic feet per day Falcon plant remains on track to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019, and at 250 million cubic feet per day Peregrine Plant is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2020. We have been focused on enhancing the surety of flow for revenue gas takeaway from Targa plants in the Permian Basin since early last year. We expect the residue gas landscape in the Permian to remain extremely tight until GCX begins operations in the fourth quarter of this year. We have secured adequate intra-basin in and out-of-basin pipeline takeaway capacity from Targa facilities benefiting both our customer and target volumes. In the Badlands, our Little Missouri gas complex continues to operate at capacity, and our crude gathering business continues to perform very well. Due to very harsh winter weather conditions in North Dakota, we lost a few weeks of construction time on our Little Missouri 4 plant relative to previous expectations and startup has slipped into the early part of the third quarter 2019. Turning to our downstream fractionation business, our facilities in Mont Belvieu continue to remain highly utilized during the first quarter. Our 100,000 barrels per day Train 6 fractionator is in startup and will be fully operational in May, and this is expected to quickly ramp and is backed by growing production from Targa facilities and long-term third party contracts. We expect the fractionation market to remain tight through 2019. Construction continues on our two new 110,000 barrels per day fractionation trains, Train 7 and Train 8. They are now expected to be online in the first quarter and the third quarter of 2020 respectively. We decided to slightly push the timing of Train 8 into the third quarter of 2020 to optimize our construction schedule and realize some modest cost savings. We expect both frac trains to be highly utilized, relative the Williams agreements we announced earlier this year. Williams recently exercised their initial option to acquire a 20% interest in our Train 7 fractionated which is an attractive arrangement for Targa and provides us with additional capital savings. Our Grand Prix NGL Pipeline is on track to be fully operational in the third quarter of this year. The pipeline segment originating from the Permian is complete and is already transporting NGL and our LPG export business. We recently completed our new pipeline between Mont Belvieu and Galena Park and we are on track to complete the rebuild of Dock 2 in the third quarter of 2019. These projects will increase our LPG supply to our Dock primarily enhancing our butane loading capabilities, which will increase our effective export capacity up to $10 million barrels per month depending upon mix of propane and butane demand vessel 5 and availability of supply. As previously announced the next phase of export expansion to increase our refrigeration capacity and load rates at our Galena Park facility is underway and will increase our effective capacity to approximate $11 million to $15 million barrels per month in the third quarter of 2020. Construction on the Gulf Coast Express residue gas pipeline or GCX continues with the pipeline expected to be fully operational in the fourth quarter of 2019 which will provide some much needed residue gas takeaway from Waha and/or the Midland Basin to Agua Dulce. Our channel view splitter is operational and is being tested and tuned by engineering and we are working on long-term third party contracts and commercialization of the assets. Turning to CapEx, as Joe Bob noted, we are employing an increasingly top down focused approach to control future CapEx and prioritize future investments around our core strategy. Our core strategy focuses on aggregating supply from our premier GMP positions, directing NGL to Grand Prix and to our downstream fractionation complex in Mont Belvieu, and having the associated spec product supply for our LPG export facilities in Galena Park. Maximizing participation across Targa's integrated value chain. There is enhanced scrutiny and the evaluation of new projects and the hurdle is even higher for any new projects outside our core strategy. Targa is on the cusp of bringing into service a number of highly strategic projects over the near-term, and we will have caught up on critical infrastructure investments that transform Targa into an integrated midstream service provider, which will result in significant moderation of future CapEx beginning in 2020. The long-term outlook for Targa is compelling, and our focus remains on executing on our strategic priorities to increase longer-term shareholder value. So with that, over the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question coming from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Michael Blum: Hi. Good morning. So I guess, it's probably your comments on capital discipline, and that's probably going to lead in to a question, I'm sure you're expecting which is of course your partner Pioneer has made public that they're going to be selling their interest in the plants that you majority own. Can you just talk about your thought process in terms of obviously those are core to your overall footprint. But in terms of just thinking about balancing that versus remaining capital discipline?
Joe Perkins: Thanks Michael, and I know that some listeners went straight from their call to our call. We obviously haven't been able to go through their call-in detail. But our answer is like the answers in previous quarters, is that Pioneer is a great partner and an important customer. The WestTX System is+ on top of some very attractive Permian Basin acreage and it's integrated with our other Permian operations. For Targa, as you mentioned in our scripted comment and remarks, we are very focused internally on project execution and increased scrutiny of new organic growth opportunities, not speaking specifically to this M&A transaction possibility, but across all of them, stepping into any M&A process right now is a much higher bar than it's ever been for Targa. The Permian Basin opportunities have been shown for us - to us for many years and we haven't done one since Outrigger acquisition. You would have to say a higher bar and a much lower probability of us doing any M&A transactions right now. If that didn't come across in the prepared remarks it should have.
Michael Blum: Great thanks. Then second question is as frac six comes on. I mean would you expect that to ramp up very quickly in terms of utilization or do you think that's going to be kind of a multi quarter deal. Thanks.
Matthew Meloy: Yes. Michael, this is Matt. I'll take that in and Scott, kick it over you if you want to fill in. So we have really been running over our capacity. We've been receiving NGL kind of over our frac capacity. So we have built some inventory, so in train six comes up we will be first off, we'll be working off our inventory. But once we work that off, we see kind of getting back to being fully utilized very quickly after we've worked off that inventory because we're already receiving y grade in excess of what we can handle in Bellevue right now. So the outlook for Train 6 is very good which is why we're eager to get Train 7 on in the first part of 2020.
Michael Blum: Great thanks.
Scott Pryor: This is Scott and I would just add that as we said in our remarks, Train 6 will be operational in May this month. And we would continue to see tightness throughout the balance of 2019. As we stated first quarter of 2020, Train 7 will come on line. We expect that one also to be highly utilized as we continue to see a ramp up in growth not only from our target plants and facilities but as well as third party activity with the contracts that we've already initiated or executed on.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning. Just want to start off with Grand Prix, I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color with regards to your expectations for how fast volumes could ramp and how much exactly of the pipeline is online now or will be soon?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. Hey, Jeremy. This is Matt. Yes. We previously gave guidance for 250,000 barrels at some point in 2020. We feel very good about that volume number. Right now, we are moving a significant amount of barrels on Grand Prix and we talked about yes providing that number. But I think the first number you'll see is when we actually just report Grand Prix in the third quarter for what volumes we're receiving into Belvieu, because what we're moving right now is really only a fraction of what will have the ability to move once we're connected all the way to Belvieu. Right now, we're complete from really on the furthest west piece of Grand Prix all the way into North Texas and we've got most of the line or a lot of the line complete up into Oklahoma and the Oklahoma extension. So we're still working on that piece that'll be done here shortly. And then it's the Belvieu piece from North Texas into Mont Belvieu which we expect to be completed in the third quarter.
Jeremy Tonet: That's helpful, thanks. There seems to be some M&A activity among Permian piece notably Anadarko there and possibly others following suit. Just wondering if you see these developments impacting target anyway.
Joe Perkins: I'd start with. We have good relationships with all the parties involved in that process. So we don't really want to get into what the potential outcome could be there. We have a really good position out in the Permian with our existing customers, have good relationships with them. And we see a lot of growth on the target system really regardless of how that plays out.
Jeremy Tonet: Great, just small last one. G&A ticked up a little bit. You said your larger organization, was this kind of a good run rate to think about going forward?
Jennifer Kneale: Jeremy, this is Jen. I think that G&A is actually going to trend lower. When we think about the rest of this year at least based on our current forecast. It's some re classes in the third and fourth quarter that ticked G&A a little bit higher and it makes it a little bit difficult to compare apples to oranges. I said on our fourth quarter earnings call that the fourth quarter was a fine run rate. We're not that far from that number here in the first quarter, but we do expect G&A maybe a little bit lower as we move through the balance of the year. But we are certainly a much larger organization and we are placing a lot of assets in service.
Operator: And our next question coming from the line of Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your line is now open.
Shneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning, everyone. Just to I guess returned to the CapEx question, kind of in your prepared remarks you mentioned increased scrutiny on spend and essential decrease in CapEx for 2020. Is there a level you're comfortable giving us in terms of context of what is substantial reduction in CapEx? Is it something like a $1 billion less? And also maybe if you can talk about or expand on this scrutiny itself. Is it about raising return hurdles? Is it about slowing down the pace to match cash flows? Just more color around the process as well.
Jennifer Kneale: Sure. This is Jen. I think that if you look at the recent projects that we've announced as we move through time. I think they highlight that we have had increased scrutiny across our organization where we're looking for opportunities that really meet sort of the core strengths of our organization. The large investment grade energy company deals in the Delaware as an example. The Williams deal is also an example for both transportation and fractionation and having those volumes available for export. So I think that we continue to scrutinize our project was and the bar for getting new projects approved continues to get higher. They have to compete for capital internally. And if there is a project that only touches one part of our value chain versus those that touch multiple parts then typically it's the deals that touch multiple parts that were more interested in at this point in time for us. So I think we've got a lot of visibility to strengthening metrics, increasing coverage, reducing leverage, improved leverage metrics when we get into the back half of this year and then into 2020 and beyond. And so we really think about it as rightsizing our capital. So relative to that increasing EBITDA, we want to be self-funding and we want to have positive free cash flow over a sustained period of time, but we're not comfortable at this point putting another line in the sand that says this is what CapEx will be and we're not going to go above it, particularly as we're in April of 2, or we are May now 2019 and forecasting capital out beyond 2020 or 2021 is difficult to do.
Shneur Gershuni: Okay. And just to sort of extend that a little bit and I think Matt touched on this in the prepared remarks. Some of the in-service delays was due to some slippage and so forth, but there also seem to be some comments around about managing spend and so forth and some cost savings can you can you sort of expand on that is that part of this scrutiny as well to.
Matthew Meloy: Yes. This is Matt here. I would say on the margin on the margin, yes, when you saw the Badlands, a little Missouri that was weather related. You saw Pembroke slip a little bit that was more just getting that project done. Hopson so highly utilized. Believe me, we want Pembroke on kind of as fast as we can but that's slipped a little bit. It's just a tight labor market out there and there are challenges and kind of the hot Permian. But for Train 8, as we looked, the construction schedule we said, yes, look we could move this from the end of Q2 to put it into Q3, save a little bit on over time and still be okay from an NGL receipt and inventory build situation. So we looked at our forecast and said, yes, we think we can move it a little bit and have some modest cost savings. It's not a lot of cost savings but it slowed down the capital spend a little bit to get some time value of money and then you get a little bit of savings from saving on over time in the line.
Shneur Gershuni: Are there other potential opportunities you're looking at where you can slip a couple of in-service dates to save money and match CapEx spend? Or is that kind of, this is the end of the route here?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. When you look at the remaining projects that we have, we're going to need the Falcon and Paragon plants to come online very quickly. And then a lot of our other projects will already-- really already be online right. The Hopson, Pembroke, Grand Prix. We need all those that come online as soon as possible. So when you look at our - that's a pretty long way through our project backlog. So there's not nearly as much as going forward in 2020 and beyond as there is on it right now.
Shneur Gershuni: Fair enough. And one final question. The LPG export arm is pretty wide right now and has been for the last couple of months. Have you been able to lock-in any incremental contracts to sort of add-on to your contract base that you already have on the LPG export terminals and expansion?
Matthew Meloy: Sure. This is Matt here. I'll start and then kick it over to Scott, if he wants to it wants to fill in some more. For this year, we are highly contracted for this year and with restrictions and delays on the Houston ship channel, we are trying to catch up on our contracted customers' needs. Right now and I think we'll be doing that through the second quarter. So could there be some opportunities for us to do that potentially, but we're really trying to catch up on customers volumes right now. Scott anything you want to -
Scott Pryor: I'd just say that's absolutely correct. Certainly the challenges that we've seen along the Houston ship channel was the unexpected closure as a result of the fire and the subsequent contamination within the channel caused some challenges for us. So we're very much focused on our term contracts. I would also add that we're very focused on renewing our contracts with existing customers, as well as adding long-term contracts that fill in relative to the expansions that we've announced. As we've said, we've got a new pipeline that's operational now from Mont Belvieu all the way to Galena Park. And in addition of [Technical Difficulty] of Dock 2 that comes online in the third quarter, all provide incremental upside for us as those projects come on line. And then additionally, as we've said before the last earnings call on this one just reiterating that the additive of refrigeration units that will come online during next year, during the middle part the third quarter of next year also provides us incremental capacity. So our focus is on long-term contracts. Our focus is on being very competitive with our fee structure to ensure that we've got growth across those expanded projects.
Shneur Gershuni: And so the contract environment is improving for those long-term contracts or you really haven't touched on that?
Scott Pryor: The environment is improving and we feel very confident about the projects that we're bringing online. And given the fact that we're going to see continued growth from our gas processing and into our assets to include Grand Prix pipeline, our expanding fractionation we know that those will be steered toward our Galena Park facility for export purposes.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Spiro Dounis: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just on the splitter and commercializing. Could you talk a little bit more about the constraints I guess that have been happening so far? And if you could expect that to complete maybe by this quarter?
Matthew Meloy: Sure. I'll start and against Scott you can fill in. Yes, we have had some constraints. At first, it was the termination of the Vitol contract where we moving their product out of our tanks and really beginning to commercialize that asset for ourselves as moving our product in and getting that facility up and running. As soon as we're getting that up and running, then we had the Houston Ship Channel where containers Bayou were shut down. We're unable to move the product out via barge. So we had limited ability to run that facility. So now with all those constraints behind us, we are getting that facility up and running, working on purchasing the supply aggregating it into the tanks, and making products, tweaking the facility to try and get the products as high a value as we can and move those out. So we're still working through that process. We're still learning as we go on this. And I think we're going to continue to do so on that facility.
Spiro Dounis: Great. And then just as we think about guidance for the year. I mean I realize it's only a first quarter but sounded maybe a few unexpected hiccups early on. But it sounds like maybe some of the base business is going pretty well. Just curious as we stand here now so far do you feel like the first quarter has been on budget and what are some of the tailwinds you think they could sort of offset as they go forward throughout the year?
Jennifer Kneale: Spiro, this is Jen. I think the first quarter performance was consistent with what our expectations were. As you rightly point out with some pluses and minuses, minuses would be NGL prices while high natural gas prices as we said in our scripted marks. Those were the lowest realized prices that we've had for a quarter since the first quarter of 2016. But I think that the year is shaping up consistent with our expectations and that's why we have affirmed our guidance. And so we'll get through this second quarter where EBITDA will be the lowest for the year as a result of the Badlands transaction and the MQD payable to GSO Blackstone. And then we'll move into the third quarter and the fourth quarter when some very important projects will come online for us, and we'll be contributing to rapidly increasing EBITDA which will help with coverage and leverage. So I think there are always pluses and minuses and that's why it's always difficult putting out any sort of forecast, but the year is shaping up relatively consistent with what our expectations have been.
Spiro Dounis: Great. Last quick one from me. I think Delaware volume skewed a little bit lower than we had expected. Just curious if there were any sort of onetime items or timing issues to call out there.
Matthew Meloy: Yes. Sure, this is Matt. There were a couple of issues; Sand Hills was taken down for maintenance for part of March which impacted the volumes. Our Sand Hills volumes are getting aggregated in the Permian Delaware. So that was down in March and then we've also been experiencing higher H2S volumes on some of from - from some of our customers out there. And so as we're treading out on the field and hitting some limits on permitting and other things, it's kind of reduced the growth and I guess I really just kind of reduced the growth out there because of the H2S .
Spiro Dounis: Yes. Got it. All right, appreciate the color.
Scott Pryor: We have an acid gas facility that will be completed later in this year that will solve some of them. So we're adding an API well at [indiscernible].
Operator: Next question coming from a Colton Bean with Tudor Pickering Holt. Your line is open.
Colton Bean: Good morning. So just to follow up in the discussion right sizing the capital program and maybe adjusting project time. Jen you mentioned 2020 plus with a bit more time to digest some of the changes we saw to upstream capital spend in Q1. Is there any change to how you're thinking about the timing of those preliminary three Permian plants that were guided to in that 2020 to 2021 timeframe?
Jennifer Kneale: I think the additional Permian plants are an example of where we're taking a really hard look at timing to make sure that we're spending our capital prudently. And to make sure that those facilities will come online to meet the needs of our producers. So I won't speak to whether they moved into or out of that forecast. I'll just speak to that; it's largely going to be dependent on producer activity levels not only through this year, but into next year. And that's really what will ultimately guide the decision and timing around when those plants need to be online and when we'll need to break out ground on them.
Colton Bean: Perfect. And just on the in-service of Gulf Coast Express I think you noted Q4 there helping to temporarily alleviate some of the basin constraints. Can you clarify how much of Targa's current and then maybe future natural gas equity volumes will be able to reach the Gulf Coast market after GCI starts up?
Matthew Meloy: We haven't quantified that. Yes, we have a 25% equity interest in the pie. We do have a significant NBC and ability to move volumes out down into the, I would say into the Gulf Coast market but we haven't given specifics on that but I would say it's a substantial piece of our total gas both Targa gas and our producers gas that we'll have access to the Gulf Coast markets.
Jennifer Kneale: It is one of the reasons we like GCS because it got us to the softest market firm.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Timm Schneider with Citi. Your line is now open.
Timm Schneider: Hey, good morning, guys. Just a quick question. You said some of the volumes on the export facility slipped from Q1 into Q2. Given the fire and what not. Can you be a bit more specific in terms of what that actually means on the volume side?
Scott Pryor: Yes. Timm, this is Scott. I would say that we expect our second quarter to be a good quarter as well with the volumes that are moving across the dock. When you think about the slippage most of that was term contracts that we had. And as Matt indicated, we'll be playing catch up for some period of the second quarter. So but we expect the volumes to be good during the second quarter as well. And if you look at the runway that we've had across several quarters, quarter in, quarter out, we've had a good high utilization of the facility which is indicative of the fact that we're predominantly contracted at the at the Dock today. And when you think about the challenges that we've had with the outages on the channel where we're recovering from that. I will say and I want people to hear this. We work very closely with the Coast Guard. We worked very closely with the EPA as they were going there through the recovery process on the channel. And I think it's also a very strong indicator of just how nimble and flexible the channel it can be, and how quickly it can recover from situations like we saw during that fire and the subsequent contamination. So we worked very well with the local authorities. And it's a testament to just really how flexible the Houston ship channel can be in times like that.
Timm Schneider: Got it. A quick follow up on that. I guess there are a couple industry reports out, I guess you guys had some issues with, I believe it was a loading arm early on in April. Has that been fixed at this point?
Scott Pryor: This is Scott again. We did have some challenges with a loading arm and but we are recovering from that as well. Recognize that we've got multiple docks. We've got multiple pipes and facilities out to our docks. So even though there may be times of challenges, if we've got a loading arm situation, we can recover from that very quickly as well.
Timm Schneider: Got it. And the last one for me. So one of your competitors came out and said, made some comments around pretty aggressively trying to beef up competition a bit on the LPG export side, keep new entrants out and what not. I don't know that necessarily doesn't apply to you. I mean new entrants I'd but I'm just trying to figure out how you guys are looking at the domestic competition versus potential international demand growth and how that kind of balances? I know you said I think on margin you're pretty constructive, incremental contracting but about any details you could offer here would be helpful?
Scott Pryor: I would just say that, again, when you look at the production of coming from upstream as an industry, these barrels are going to be pointed toward export docks, existing docks today. I think the markets going to be very competitive for that. With the existing players out there, I think that when you look at potential expansions, it's going to mostly come from the existing players that are leveraging their integrated platform that they have today. And basically that's part of the reason why you see very strategic projects on our part. An additive of a new pipeline, refurbishment of our dock added refrigeration. It's a lot easier for us to add incremental capacity with an existing facility. So it's going to be very competitive and we will play what role we need to play to ensure that we've got good continuity to our docks and flow well assurance.
Operator: Our next question coming from the TJ Schultz with RBC. Your line is now open.
TJ Schultz: Great, thanks, good morning. Just first regarding the labor in the Permian and hiring ahead of facilities coming online. Are you expecting that to remain tight for the foreseeable future? How far in advance are you hiring and kind of when should we expect to see improvements on a per unit basis?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. I'd say it's our expectation that it is going to remain pretty tight out there in the Permian. Even with maybe some moderation of growth expectations on the producer side, they're still going to be incremental processing plants, incremental facilities, incremental pipelines going in. So I think it's our expectation that does remain tight, maybe not as tight as we would have forecasted 12-months ago, but it's still going to be pretty tight. I think you'll start to see the unit margins improve as we really move through this year. The large investment grade company that we've talked about is kind of starting to ramp, and it's going to increase as we move through the year. There's going to be large volume expectations out on the Delaware largely because of that contract, but also other producer contracts as well. So we have Falcon coming on. We have Peregrine coming on. So I think as volumes ramped, you'll really start to see those unit margins come down some over time. And is really even beyond 2020 right. So then 2020 and 2021 and thereafter. And also the AGI well that Joe Bob mentioned earlier, that's coming on here over the summer. There are - there's relatively high OpEx for field treating on some of the H2S. When that gets in this summer, we should see that improve our OpEx over time as well.
TJ Schultz: Okay, got it. Just second question would be in the Eagle Ford, the primary producer into raptors going through some strategic reviews, just current expectations on commitments into the system there. And then outside that JV maybe just general expectations in the Eagle Ford as volume trends as some new producers have bought into the play, just any general color there. Thanks.
Matthew Meloy: Sure. I'd say our near-term expectations have been reduced. When we look at our internal forecast and our volumes for South Texas, I think you've seen volumes come down and our expectations are lower than they were a year ago or so. I think over time, there's a good rock, there's an opportunity for growth in and around that asset at some point, but in the near term there's going to be some pressure on those volumes.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Christine Cho with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Christine Cho: Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess just quickly for me and now that your partner on the WestTX system is out formally with a sale process. So curious to hear if that opens up any opportunity for you guys to, I guess gives you an ability to renegotiate any of the commercial terms on that system? Whether that be fee renegotiation or maybe directing some of the liquid volumes back on your system?
Joe Perkins: Appreciate the question with or without an M&A transaction unlikely, we would talk about any negotiations that were going on. And Pioneer is free to have those same sort of discussions and we're in constant contact with them. Very good partner, terrific producer customer and it's not appropriate for us to talk about commercial contracts and terms are definitely not potential renegotiations of commercial contracts or terms.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Danilo Juvane: Thank you and good morning. My first question is for Jen; follow up on the guidance question. Jen, where do you ultimately see EBITDA landing the relative the guidance midpoint this year? And more importantly, can you provide any thoughts on where you ultimately see target achieving, its target leverage and coverage metrics?
Jennifer Kneale: I think we're going to let our affirmation of guidance remain as sort of the standalone guidance point out there, Danilo. So, if you look at where we are in terms of operational metrics related to that guidance. We're on track and so it feels a little early, a little premature to say where we think we're going to shake out. As we said a little bit on the call earlier, there have been some pluses and minuses already through the first four months of the year. Expect it to continue to be as we move forward and ultimately we do have some exposure to commodity prices looking forward to having Grand Prix additional fracs online without commodity price exposure decreases as we move past 2019 and through time. But that is material to our guidance and our outlook for this year. And so ultimately we'll have to see where everything shakes out.
Danilo Juvane: Understood. Second question. I know that you no longer have CapEx earmarked for Whistler, but do you have any insights as when this project can potentially reach FID? Thank you.
Matthew Meloy: We know that those parties are working on that process to commercialize it. As we said before, we --that project has strategic value for us. We want more residues to get built from the Permian in the Gulf Coast market. So we are lending our support for that project, and we'll wait for those parties that are going to have an equity interest to kind of give an update on project status there.
Danilo Juvane: Should we expect you to have some contracting pipeline as well?
Matthew Meloy: I think that's one of the ways that we could support the project.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Dennis Coleman with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Dennis Coleman: Hi and thanks for taking my question. Quite a lot of conversation here about the new capital allocation process and how you think about the strategic nature of assets. Given sort of the rethink on that does it bring a rethink on potential asset sales into the picture as well? Obviously, you've done quite a lot there, but maybe a different way to think about what you own in the portfolio?
Jennifer Kneale: Dennis, this is Jen. Firstly, I wouldn't say that it's a new process. I think that we spend a lot of time scrutinizing our capital projects. We just haven't spent as much time talking about it with our investors and potential investors as we would have liked earlier. And so that's what we're trying to do is really provide you with a lot more clarity on how we are seeing the world and thinking about the world relative to growth capital spending as we move through time. We have been successful with some asset sales. We're constantly looking across the portfolio to see if it makes sense to sell any assets and/or if it makes sense to enter into additional joint ventures. And so that hasn't changed, but we don't have any active processes underway right now like we did when we disclosed the Badlands process for example or prior to that the petroleum logistics sale. So we have nothing sort of actively underway at this time.
Dennis Coleman: Okay, thank you. And then just maybe this is a little bit obvious with the cades, the projects coming onstream this here in the - more in the first half, but the CapEx obviously 35% to the budget spent in the first quarter. I guess maybe should we think about similar amount in the second quarter and then winding down from there into 2020 that you've talked about the lower spent?
Jennifer Kneale: And directionally that's right, Denis, without giving you sort of an exact dollar amount for expectations for the second quarter. We've got both our quarterly CapEx plus the Outrigger payment this quarter. And then absolutely, we'd expect that to trend down as we move through time beyond this quarter.
Operator: At this time, I am showing now further question. I would like to turn the call back over to Sanjay Lad for closing remarks.
Sanjay Lad: Thank you everyone that was on the call this morning. And we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. I will be available over the course of the day for any follow-up questions you may have. Thanks and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. And you may now disconnect.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Joe Bob.
Joe Perkins: Thanks, Sanjay. Thank you to everyone for joining our fourth quarter and year-end 2018 call. It's a pleasure to be with you again this morning. 2018 was one of the busiest years ever at Targa, and what should be viewed as another transformational year for the company. Over the course of 2018, including only the major headlines, Targa added approximately 860 million cubic feet per day of incremental natural gas processing capacity. Announced the significant Delaware Basin G&P expansion supported by long-term agreements with a large investment-grade energy company. Approved and began construction on another 1.2 billion cubic feet per day of incremental processing capacity. Announced and began construction on the Grand Prix extension into southern Oklahoma. Announced and began construction on two new 110,000-barrel per day fractionators at our Mont Belvieu complex. Created innovative development company joint ventures or so called DevCos that provided $190 million of capital reimbursement at closing. In total, potential capital savings of up to $960 million on projects already in process. Raised approximately $684 million of common equity and issued $1 billion of senior notes over the course of the year. Generated approximately $230 million in proceeds from asset sales. And Targa exceeded our previously disclosed full year 2018 adjusted EBITDA guidance, that is a new Targa record with annual EBITDA of $1,366,000,000. Most importantly, those Targa execution highlights are complemented by the continued safe operations of our existing infrastructure facilities and our projects under construction with safety focus as job number one for our talented and dedicated employees across the company. Now we're only 1.5 months into 2019 and we've not slowed down. So far, in this New Year, we closed on an aggregate $1.5 billion of 8.5-year and 10-year senior notes at attractive rates, demonstrating tremendous bondholder support for the Targa story. We announced the further extension of Grand Prix into the STACK region of central Oklahoma, executed definitive supporting agreements with Williams and secured significant additional long-term NGL volume commitments for transportation on Grand Prix and fractionation at our Mont Belvieu complex. And we very recently executed definitive agreements for the sale of a 45% interest in our Badlands business, generating proceeds of approximately $1.6 billion. These proceeds will substantially meet our estimated equity needs for 2019, for announced net growth CapEx and the Permian acquisition earn out. It was a very important deal and we were happy to announce it earlier this week. Those of you who follow us closely know that many of our major projects underway will be completed over the next few months, including our Grand Prix NGL pipeline project. We've been saying this for some time now, and we'll say it again, Grand Prix really is a strategic competitive game-changer for Targa. It seems like every quarter, we announce another exciting new development that leverages Grand Prix in our integrated asset base, and the Williams deal does that again. Our growth projects underway position us for significant EBITDA growth. The strength of our integrated asset footprint and growth projects complemented by our continued commercial success drive increasing largely fee-based cash flows, an attractive long-term outlook and substantially increased Targa size, scale and customer reputation as a large cap infrastructure operator. Fundamentally, the robust long-term outlook for domestic production volumes and what that means for Targa will lead to the high utilization of our infrastructure expansions, recently completed and underway, providing the line of sight to significantly increasing free cash flow at Targa. Targa is in a special unique position. An investor recently made some observations that I believe will soon become more widely appreciated, and I'd like to share this with you. Number one, Targa has a franchise Permian G&P position and diversity from other strong G&P positions. Number two, he said, Targa is one of only a very few integrated companies with the combination of strong Gathering and Processing plus NGL transportation, plus Mont Belvieu fractionation, plus NGL exports and other premium downstream markets. Number three, Targa has an unmatched growth picture among significantly-sized midstream companies and has a growing amount of fee-based business. And he summarized, Targa is clearly on path to join a short list of high-performing, scaled, investment-grade midstream companies. And on that path, we'll experience above peer group growth, rapid deleveraging and dividend coverage improvement. That path is highly visible to me. It was highly visible to him from our projects coming online in company and our commercial success. So as I wrap up my introductory comments, I'd like to directly address statements and likely questions about where Targa should be with respect to its capital expenditures and free cash flow. As a long-term Targa investor, privileged to work closely with the Targa team, the Targa assets, the Targa customers and the Targa opportunities, I believe, we are in a very good spot. Our profile and timing will be different than peer companies simply because Targa has been blessed with an abundance of high-return strategic projects relative to our size over the last few years. We have creatively partnered, prioritized and funded those high-return strategic opportunities, pursuing them, we certainly should not have ignored them. Now with high visibility beginning in the second half of 2019, such projects are coming online, highly utilized in creating a rapid increase in our cash flow situation, and we will continue to prioritize capital expenditures resulting in lower levels of CapEx and even lower levels relative to our EBITDA. Targa is clearly on a path to join a short list of high-performing, scaled investment-grade midstream companies. And on that path, we'll experience above peer group growth, rapid deleveraging and dividend coverage improvement. With that, I'll now turn it over to Matt.
Matthew Meloy: Thanks, Joe Bob, and good morning, everyone. Let's now get into some of the specifics of our record-setting 2018 and discuss how that translate into our positioning for 2019 and beyond. Overall, Targa's 2018 inlet volumes in the Permian increased 24% over the previous year, and 2018 total Field G&P increased 17% over the previous year. While producers have recently adjusted budgets and forecasts, commercial activity and production in many of our operating regions remains robust, and we expect activity levels to remain strong. In our Permian region, we expect continued production growth in 2019 across both the Midland and Delaware Basins, despite the temporary delay of some completions as producers await infrastructure expansions to come online throughout 2019. In Permian Midland, our Johnson Plant came online late September and was quickly highly utilized. And our 250 million cubic feet per day Hopson Plant will begin operation in early second quarter and is also expected to be highly utilized at start-up. The next 250 million cubic feet per day Pembrook Plant is expected to begin operations late in the second quarter. In Permian Delaware, a substantial portion of the asset underpinned via deal with a large investment-grade company are completed or well underway. Our 250 million cubic feet per day Falcon Plant remains on track to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019, and the 250 million cubic feet per day Peregrine Plant is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2020. These additional plants across the Permian will be interconnected to our multiplant, multisystem footprint with a vast majority of the NGL volumes flowing through Grand Prix to our fractionators in Mont Belvieu. In the Badlands, our Little Missouri complex is operating at capacity, and our volumes at our facility would have been even higher if we had additional processing capacity. Our Little Missouri Plant 4 is expected to be online in the second quarter of 2019 and will progressively ramp over the second half of the year. Our average crude oil gathered volumes in 2018 increased 29% over the prior year's average volumes. As producer well results continue to improve, we expect continued growth in 2019 for both crude and gas in the Badlands. Turning to the Downstream Business. Grand Prix will be fully operational around mid-year, and volumes are expected to progressively ramp over the second half of this year. We are able to significantly expand Grand Prix's capacity with low-cost pump station additions incrementally as required, which further enhances the project's long-term value. We are ordering long lead items for the pipeline's second expansion phase, which will increase the capacity of the segment originating from the Permian by adding pump stations to approximately 450,000 barrels per day. The cost of this expansion is included in our 2019 CapEx forecast. Last week, we announced a low-cost extension of Grand Prix into the STACK region of central Oklahoma. Grand Prix will interconnect to Williams' Bluestem Pipeline in Kingfisher County, opening up additional access to the Conway NGL market and volumes from the DJ Basin. The further expansion of Grand Prix into the STACK is an attractive extension of a highly strategic asset for Targa and will direct significant incremental NGLs over the long term from Williams and other third parties to Grand Prix and through our downstream assets in Mont Belvieu and Galena Park. This extension will have an initial capacity of approximately 120,000 barrels per day, with a target in-service of first quarter 2021, and it's expected to cost approximately $200 million. As part of this deal, Targa provides Williams with an initial option to purchase a 20% equity interest in one of Targa's Frac Train 7 or 8 in Mont Belvieu. That option may increase depending on incremental committed volumes. This deal is an example of leveraging our unique position, while also supporting our overall business and capital efficiency. Turning to our fractionation business. Our facilities in Mont Belvieu continue to remain highly utilized during the fourth quarter, with full year 2018 fractionation volumes increasing 20% over 2017. Our next new 100,000-barrel per day Train 6 fractionator will begin operations in the second quarter and is expected to be highly utilized at start-up. We expect the fractionation market to remain tight throughout 2019, as increasing Y-grade NGL supply is directed to Mont Belvieu from new pipelines. Construction is underway on two new Targa 110,000-barrel per day fractionation trains, Trains 7 and 8. They are expected to be online in the first quarter and second quarter of 2020, respectively. Our fractionation expansions will accommodate a robust outlook for increasing Y-grade NGL supply to Mont Belvieu, which for us will largely be coming from Grand Prix. In our LPG export business, we are on track to complete our new pipeline between Mont Belvieu and Galena Park, and the rebuild of Dock 2 by mid-year 2019. We are moving forward with a planned expansion to increase our refrigeration capacity and load rates to further enhance our LPG export capabilities at our Galena Park facility. In the third quarter of 2020, our current effective export capacity of 7 million barrels per month will increase to approximately 11 million to 15 million barrels per month, depending on the mix of propane and butane demand, vessel size and availability of supply, among other things. The estimated cost of this expansion is included in our 2019 CapEx forecast. Construction on the Gulf Coast Express residue gas pipeline or GCX continues, and the project remains essentially on time and on budget with the pipeline expected to be fully operational in the fourth quarter of this year, which will provide some much-needed residue gas takeaway from Waha and/or the Midland Basin to Agua Dulce. We're also very interested in seeing the Whistler project go forward, and continue to work to commercialize a project as this provides strategic residue takeaway for Targa and our customers. While we continue to support the project, we don't expect to have any meaningful ownership interest or capital requirement for this project. Our crude and condensate splitter at our Channelview Terminal is in start-up, we are working on third-party contracts and commercialization of the asset after Vitol terminated its splitter contract in December of last year. We expect this to be a well performing asset for Targa. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jen to discuss Targa's results for the fourth quarter and present our 2019 operational and financial outlook.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $376 million. Fourth quarter EBITDA include a recognition of the remaining $32 million cash payment associated with the terminated splitter agreement. Normalizing for the splitter deferred revenue recognition, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter decreased 4% sequentially due to lower commodity prices and lower fractionation margin, partially offset by higher Badlands and Permian volumes. Dividend coverage for the fourth quarter was 0.91x. During the fourth quarter, we recognized a $210 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. The only remaining goodwill balance on our financials relates to the 2017 Permian acquisition. In our Gathering and Processing segment, higher volumes and fee-based margin in our Badlands business along with higher Permian volumes were more than offset by lower commodity prices. Operating margin decreased $5.3 million in the fourth quarter when compared to the third quarter. Fourth quarter Permian inlet volumes increased 7% over the third quarter from growth in each of our Permian Midland and Permian Delaware systems. The sequential increase in Permian inlet volumes was partially impacted by a temporary operational disruption during the quarter on a third-party NGL pipeline exiting the basin. Our fourth quarter crude oil gathered volumes in the Badlands increased 4% over the third quarter, driven by continued strong production growth across our dedicated acreage. Permian volumes gathered in the fourth quarter were down 9% over the third quarter due to temporary disruptions of third-party facilities. In our Logistics and Marketing segment, operating margin decreased $23 million in the fourth quarter when compared to the third quarter, driven predominantly by lower marketing gains, lower fractionation margin and lower terminaling and storage throughput, primarily due to the divestiture of our Tacoma and Baltimore terminals, partially offset by higher domestic marketing margin and higher LPG export margin. As Matt mentioned, our fractionation facilities remained highly utilized, averaging about 450,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter, despite that temporary curtailment of Y-grade NGL supply volumes to Mont Belvieu from the previously-mentioned operational disruption on a third-party NGL pipe. At our Galena Park facility, LPG exports remained strong during the fourth quarter as we averaged 6.5 million barrels per month. We are very pleased with our full year 2018 operational and financial performance. Full year 2018 operating margin in our Gathering and Processing and Downstream segments increased 24% and 16%, respectively, over 2017, and we exceeded our previously-disclosed full year 2018 adjusted EBITDA guidance. Moving to other finance-related matters. The fair value of the earn-out payment for our Permian acquisition is currently estimated to be $308 million, with the payment payable in May 2019. The $21 million decrease in the contingent consideration compared to the third quarter estimate was driven by a lower forecast of volumes, partially offset by a shorter discount period. During the fourth quarter, we executed additional hedges for Targa's percent of proceeds equity commodity position. Based on our estimate of current equity volumes from Field Gathering and Processing, for full year 2019, we have hedged approximately 75% of condensate, 75% of natural gas and 70% of NGLs, and we estimate that we've hedged approximately 45% of condensate, 40% of NGLs and 35% of natural gas volumes for 2020. As Joe Bob mentioned, in January, we successfully issued an aggregate $1.5 billion of 6.5% and 6.78% senior notes due in July 2027 and January 2029, and we appreciate the tremendous support from our fixed-income investors. Net proceeds from the senior notes offering were used to redeem our November 2019 maturity, and substantially reduce borrowings under our TRP revolver. As we look at our maturity stack, we feel very well positioned, given our next meaningful maturity is in May 2023. On a debt compliance basis, TRP's leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately 4.1x versus a compliance covenant of 5.5x. Our consolidated reported debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 4.9x. Full year 2018 net growth CapEx was $2.7 billion, and net maintenance CapEx was $128 million. Spending in the fourth quarter was higher than we estimated in November. Given the number of projects that we have under way, precision around timing of capital spend is more difficult than it typically will be, and more projects were completed in the fourth quarter than expected. Yesterday, we announced that we entered into definitive agreements to sell a 45% interest in Targa Badlands LLC, the entity that holds all of Targa's assets in North Dakota to funds managed by GSO Capital Partners and Blackstone Tactical Opportunities, collectively Blackstone, for $1.6 billion. We expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2019 subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Under the terms of the executed agreements, Targa will continue to be the operator and will hold majority governance rights. Future growth capital is expected to be funded on a pro rata basis. Badlands will pay a minimum quarterly distribution of Blackstone and to Targa based on their initial investments, and Blackstone's capital contributions will have a liquidation preference upon a sale of Badlands. This minority interest sale is in a growth satisfying a substantial portion of our estimated funding needs for 2019 and provides us with significant flexibility looking forward. Pro forma to the senior notes offering, the redemption of our November 2019 maturity and the anticipated proceeds from the Badlands sale, our consolidated liquidity as of year-end was approximately $4.3 billion. Pro forma for the Badlands sale, our compliance and consolidated reported debt-to-EBITDA metrics was 3.4x and 4.3x, respectively, at the end of the fourth quarter. Let's now turn to our expectations for 2019, which assume NGL composite barrel prices to average $0.60 per gallon, crude oil prices to average $54 per barrel and natural gas prices to average $3 per MMbtu for the year. Beginning with our Gathering and Processing segment, we expect total Permian natural gas inlet volumes for 2019 to average between 1.85 billion to 1.95 billion cubic feet per day, with the midpoint of the range representing a 20% increase in average 2019 Permian inlet volumes over the 2018 average. We expect Permian inlet volumes to sequentially ramp throughout 2019 as our new processing plants come online. We expect to average 2019 inlet volumes in SouthOK and the Badlands to be higher than average 2018. Collectively, we expect total Field G&P natural gas inlet volumes for 2019 to average between 3.45 billion to 3.65 billion cubic feet per day, with the midpoint of the range representing an approximate 10% increase over 2018 average inlet. We also expect total crude gathered volumes in both the Badlands and the Permian to be higher on average in 2019 than average 2018. Downstream, we expect fractionation volumes to increase year-over-year, largely driven by growth in our Permian G&P volumes and the addition of Train 6. Pro forma for the 45% interest sale in Badlands which again is expected to close in the second quarter, we expect full year 2019 adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. We expect 2019 quarterly adjusted EBITDA to benefit as our growth projects, including Permian and Badlands processing expansion, Train 6 and Grand Prix begin operations and ramp through the second half of the year. Our EBITDA outlook for 2019 is lower than the preliminary range that we published in November given, one, on the largest impact item the 45% sale of the Badlands, which includes the minimum quarterly distribution of Blackstone ahead of Targa in a rapidly growing business; two, a lower commodity price forecast given the decrease in prices in mid-November, we did a revised plan for our board using a lower price deck; and three, lower volumes from reduced activity at that lower price deck. First quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected to be sequentially lower than fourth quarter 2018, and second quarter EBITDA pro forma for the Badlands is expected to be the lowest quarter of 2019. EBITDA will meaningfully increase in the second half of the year as our growth projects come online and begin to ramp. Operating expenses and corporate G&A expenses are expected to increase year-over-year as a result of the additional assets coming online. We expect full year 2019 dividend coverage to be about 0.9x, assuming a flat $3.64 annual dividend with significantly higher coverage in the second half of 2019 than the first half. Our current 2019 net growth CapEx estimate for announced projects is approximately $2.3 billion, inclusive of the additional pumps for Grand Prix, the expansion at Galena Park and the CapEx associated with the Williams transaction versus what we published back in November, and also reduced spending in the Badlands from the minority interest sale. Full year 2019 maintenance CapEx is forecasted to be approximately $130 million. Our line of sight to significantly ramping EBITDA in the back half of 2019, 2020 and beyond, will result in a stronger balance sheet, increasing dividend coverage and additional free cash flow. The long-term outlook for Targa is compelling and our focus remains on executing on our strategic priorities to increase long-term shareholder value. So with that, Tom, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Michael Blum from Wells Fargo.
Michael Blum: A couple of things here then I'll jump back in the queue. I guess, a couple of questions on Badlands. Can you talk about what the MQD is to Blackstone? And then, can you just elaborate a little bit on the liquidation frac trends, if, I guess, if Blackstone wants to sell, what happens or if you want to sell? Anything you can just further expand upon that.
Jennifer Kneale: Sure. Obviously, we've got $1.6 billion of capital upfront, and we've said that there is an MQD ahead of Targa, a minimum quarterly distribution. And given this is a rapidly growing business that implies that the share distributions in the first couple of years is larger than the share of distributions after that, and that was important to allow Blackstone to derisk their investment and for us to maximize the upfront proceeds that we received. With regards to the liquidation preference, it's well outside the sort of five year-plus investment horizon than investors typically think about, well outside of our planned period. But there are options for us to repurchase the interest in the Badlands and there are also options whereby if there was a sale of the assets in a 100% sale, Blackstone would receive a preference in that liquidation to get their proceeds back first.
Michael Blum: Okay. And then, will there be taxes paid? Is there like a gain on sale here with taxes? And if not, how does this impact your NOL? And when you think you would be a cash tax payer?
Jennifer Kneale: We don't have a change to the longer-term outlook that we have in terms of when we will become a taxpayer because of this, Michael. The way that some of the benefits from some of the changes in tax legislation benefit us in the relative near years versus later on means that there really isn't much of a tax impact related to this transaction. So no change on the guidance, so we don't expect to be a cash taxpayer for some years now.
Michael Blum: Okay, great. And then last question for me for now. So you didn't make any comment on kind of the longer-term guidance that you've provided for EBITDA. Should we assume that that is unchanged or is there a way to think about that in light of the change in '19?
Jennifer Kneale: I think from our perspective, the long-term outlook absolutely remains intact. We've now sold the 45% interest in the Badlands, which is a detractor from that longer-term outlook, but we've also announced the Williams transaction. So similar to when we put out the first long-term outlook in June of 2017, this isn't something that we expect to update on a monthly or quarterly or even semi-annual basis. But I think that you can tell from our remarks that the long-term outlook for our business is as strong as it's ever been and we're very much excited about it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni from UBS.
Shneur Gershuni: I guess to start off, I was wondering if we can sort of talk about the 2019 guide for today. I was wondering if you can sort of compare as apples-to-apples from where it was in November versus now? Obviously, there's a commodity revision, which makes sense. But I was wondering if you can sort of talk about some of the specifics, is there an adjustment for the canceled splitter, I mean, they gave you a payment upfront. So have you adjusted that lower? What's the amount that you're assuming for Badlands? Should we see something for frac spreads? Just some of the details for us to effectively look at it on an apples-to-apples basis.
Jennifer Kneale: We try to give you some color to do that, Shneur, in our scripted remarks, so I think that you hit a lot of the key components head on. The Badlands partial interest sale is the biggest delta when we look at what we put out today versus what we described in 2019, which was early November, which was a preliminary look at 2019. And then as we worked with our board under a lower price deck to basically redo the plan that we typically do in the fall, and then we saw lower prices in November and December, decided to redo that plan. What you're also seeing as a result of the lower commodity prices plus lower volumes related to that new plan. Our perspective is that we will be able to manage the splitter for Targa and we will be able to generate margin for the splitter. And so there is some margin included or embedded in our 2019 EBITDA based on our view of how we can manage that asset for our benefit without the terminated contract.
Shneur Gershuni: Okay. Fair enough. Just turning over to CapEx for a minute. It was revised upwards by about $300 million. I recognize that CapEx starts to step down next year after some of the big projects come into place. But there has been some, call it, 2020 and 2021 growth CapEx creep over the last couple of quarters due to strong growth. We now have EMPs living within cash flows and recounts that it's kind of flattened. Do you see a slowing in CapEx? Is there a likelihood that we won't see any further CapEx creep for at least 2020?
Joe Perkins: Shneur, this is Joe Bob. Back on my opening remarks, I was trying to address that head on. As we have benefited from tremendous opportunities, we have had what you described as capital creep, I described it as capital blessings. Those are high return strategic investments that every investor looking under the covers would want us to make. And I think most investors and analysts like you looking from the outside in, knowing what they are and when they're coming on, wanted us to make those investments. We've got terrific visibility of the cash flow that's going to be created with that, whether or like your team, you're modeling it from the bottom-up one project at a time with our comments of when they're coming on and that they're coming on highly utilized, or at the more top-down simplified calculation of it, which say what's that capital work in progress. It's $2.5 billion. Much of which comes in online in the second half at conservative multiples shows you the cash flow that's being generated. We also described that we have been using discipline in prioritization, only doing the strategic in high return projects, and we will continue to do so. It's natural that we have a slug up because of the quality of our assets, the quality of the footprint and the Permian basis of that footprint.  We have "caught up some," building two fractionators that once catches you up, building multiple plants in the Permian at the same time begins to catch you up. I think our comments says that we expected lower CapEx in 2020 and even lower as a percent or as a ratio to that EBITDA. I feel very good about that position. It's a terrific position. If you're comparing it to the other EMP companies and the peers, we should be slowing down slower than them because we had so many more opportunities. I'm -- that may have sound a little overly passionate, I do see the headlines, we did talk with investors about it. Mostly, every time we talk to them because they want to understand how we feel about that opportunity set and the fact that to some extent, they're waiting a little longer for free cash flow. But in the meantime, they've experienced the growth. And now, they're going to experience the deleveraging and the rapid improvement in coverage. Did that address the question?
Shneur Gershuni: It definitely does. I did have one final, I guess, kind of accounting-related type question. When we think about the Badlands asset sale. Based on your response to Mike, there doesn't seem to be any tax proceeds and so forth. When we think about it from a cash flow statement perspective, first of all, is the agency is going to treat it completely as an equity infusion? And secondly, does it show up in investing cash flow or will it show up in financing cash flow given the structure with the MQDs and so forth?
Jennifer Kneale: So as we work through the potential transaction, we obviously informed the rating agencies as we worked through different potential structures. And so our view is that both Moody's and S&P will treat it as -- will give it equity treatment.
Shneur Gershuni: And will it show up as financing cash flow or will it show up as investing cash flow?
Matthew Meloy: Well, Shneur, it's going to be consolidated. Since we operate in control, it's still going to be a consolidated entity but then with a minority interest cutback kind of how we handle our other consolidated entities with minority cutbacks.
Jennifer Kneale: The usual NGL cutback.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JP Morgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Just want to touch on the Badlands transaction one last time, if I could. I was just wondering if you could expand a bit more as far as why 45% was the right level to go for in this deal as opposed to a small number or a bigger number? And kind of how you see that stacking up against ATM issuance at this point?
Jennifer Kneale: I think that everything you've seen us do over the last couple of years, Jeremy, is reflective of the fact that we think our equity is undervalued, particularly, when we look at the strength of our long-term outlook and the visibility that we have to that long-term outlook. So for Targa, when we first contemplated a potential minority interest sale in the Badlands, one of our key goals has always been to maximize the upfront proceeds that we receive to help derisk everything else that's going on at our company. And so that's why 45% seem like a great number. We would have been willing to sell up to 49% or we would have been willing to sell less if we didn't get a right valuation or a right structure. But what Blackstone was able to do for us was to help us maximize those upfront proceeds in a structure that we're very comfortable with.
Jeremy Tonet: That's helpful. And you touched on a couple of different times in the call Targa is really growing into a fully integrated player in midstream from wellhead to exports there. And it seems like this enables you guys to win kind of new growth projects and capture things that give you better returns than may be others in the industry can do. So I was just wondering how you see the midstream industry evolving here? If others can't compete with you guys in winning these type of project, how do you think about industry consolidation progressing going forward?
Joe Perkins: That's a really interesting way of asking the question. I think what I said is there are only a very few of us who look like that, and you all can list them. And guess what, they can compete with me, okay? That shortlist of players who have a gathering and processing footprint, a natural gas liquids pipeline, a presence at Mont Belvieu, that's quite competitive. But, for example, that large investment-grade energy player in the Delaware, I only consider folks that look like that and we did win that one. The Williams transaction probably had some competition, we did win that one. We don't win all of them, but by beating that integrated player with that scale, I think, customer fit reputation, we're going to win our share, maybe more than our share, and then we get the blessing, the prioritizing opportunities. Our team is very focused on that over the course of this year and next year. How do we get the biggest bang for the buck and how do we work on more smaller projects and less larger projects. But it's a function of a terrific footprint that now terrific integration and the reputation we've put in place with our customers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colton Bean from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Colton Bean: I just wanted to follow up on the commentary there around the 2020 and 2021 capital spend. The expectation of lower spend referenced to the preliminary guide of $1.8 billion, or is that more a reference to 2019 levels?
Joe Perkins: I actually described '18 and '19, I mean '19, '20, I believe, Colton, and if I didn't, that's what I meant. Yes, we're trying to have 2020 capital lower than 2019 capital. I don't think I went further than 2020. We believe we can do that. We believe that that's natural. We've already been prioritizing our capital expenditures, but prioritized capital expenditures came in at a pretty high level, particularly relative to the EBITDA that we had in time. Now the additional good news is we've got a lot more EBITDA coming on at the end of 2019 and into 2020. We have even at a flat level or a slightly reduced level, that's less of a strain on the organization than the current level was at our current EBITDA. We would like to get to that space of being free cash flow. We can't do that as quickly as a peer that doesn't have very many opportunities.
Jennifer Kneale: I don't think that our view has changed much either, Colton, that when you think about November that $1.8 billion aggregate number that we put out for a 2020 plus 2021 preliminary CapEx that we really see that changing much based on what we have looking forward. So the Williams deal will add some incrementally to that a small amount, particularly when you think about the structure of that transaction and what it will bring to Targa on transport on Grand Prix and fractionation at Belvieu. And then that $1.8 billion also already included the other projects that we thought were in the near-term horizon, and that view hasn't changed at all in terms of incremental processing plants in an incremental frac.
Colton Bean: Got it. And so given the change that we've seen on the upstream budget, no impact thus far to that $1.8 billion?
Jennifer Kneale: No.
Colton Bean: Yes. Okay. And just circling back to Scott's commentary on Galena Park, I think as of Q3, you had mentioned the possibility of an expansion to maybe 10 million to 11 million barrels a month. It sounds like that's substantially higher. So can you guess or provide a bit of commentary to what's allowing you to get to that 11 million to 15 million barrels a month?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. The first time we talked about expanding there was adding a 20-inch pipeline between Galena Park and Mont Belvieu to allow us to flow additional butane as long as -- as well as doing some dock work. This expansion we talked about today is adding refrigeration capacity, which is going to basically more effectively allows us to utilize those pipelines. So it's really depends on a customer demand and how much ultimate butane demand there is. So it's a pretty wide range of 11 million to 15 million barrels a month to the extent there's more butane demand, we'd be at the high end of that range. To the extent there's less butane demand, we'd be at the low end of that range. There's really the next step to get us to that real next leg of significant expansion. So I think the refrigeration was a key piece to us.
Colton Bean: Okay. And just on the refrigeration, is that part of the capital increase that we've seen from that 2 to 2.3?
Matthew Meloy: It is, yes.
Colton Bean: Got it.
Jennifer Kneale: And that was also included in the $1.8 billion for '20 and 2021. So that accelerated into 2020. So obviously that changes what the 2021 number may have been depending on when we had it staged.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christine Cho from Barclays.
Christine Cho: If I could start with the project with Williams that lateral that you're extending into the stack in the prepared remarks you talk about, is third-party opportunities tied to that? What is the opportunity set over there aside from the Williams volumes? Is it mostly new plants that haven't yet dedicated their volumes? Or are there some legacy plants that have contracts coming due in the beginning of next decade that could be fair game?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. I'd say, it's both. There are some new plants going in, and we're having discussions with new customers up there about a potential dedication of their plants or volumes from the area. So there is some of that. And then we're, of course, there's a portfolio of plants up there and in that region that have various contracts that may or will be rolling off over time, so we're having discussions with both of those parties.
Christine Cho: And the initial capacity of 120,000 barrels per day, well, can that be expanded to ballpark wise?
Matthew Meloy: Well, I guess, it really depends on what line we ultimately lie up there and what kind of pumps we put on it. So we're still finalizing that. We expect the 120,000 to be a good initial capacity, but it ultimately depends on pipelines, not only that pipeline but also downstream of that as well.
Christine Cho: Okay. And then your partner in some of the Permian processing plants has indicated an interest to sell their stake in the JV. How do you guys think about this? Do you find it necessary to own the whole thing if that partner wants to exit? Or are you fine letting the interest get sold to someone else given the multiple you just sold an interest for in the Badlands?
Joe Perkins: Our partner in the Permian is a terrific partnership. I think they say similar things about the Targa relationship. We worked very well with Pioneer, and have excellent communications. We work strategically well. The partnership is strategic for both of us. I believe that most of their comments about potentially selling their interest in the Permian in response to questions on calls like these unless playing offense about it. Those discussions could occur. We don't have a driving force on either side of that equation. And it's different. It's just different to think about how that might be monetized to Targa than how it might be up monetized to another player.
Christine Cho: Fair enough. Last question. Can you just remind me the Outrigger payment, is that included in growth CapEx, or is that incremental to growth CapEx?
Jennifer Kneale: It's incremental.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson from SunTrust.
Tristan Richardson: Just thinking about corporate expenses year-over-year in 2019, fully appreciate the new projects will contribute to higher overall corporate cost. Should we think about the 4Q sequential step up is a general representation of how to think about '19 G&A costs?
Jennifer Kneale: I think for both OpEx and G&A, you should expect that year-over-year those costs will be up a fair amount, just given how many projects are being put into service. I think when you look at where we were in the fourth quarter and the third quarter, which was actually fairly flat from an OpEx perspective. On a go-forward rate, I would continue to have somewhat of a ramp in there on a Q1 to Q4 basis in 2019.
Tristan Richardson: Helpful. Go ahead, I'm sorry.
Matthew Meloy: There's movement -- on any one quarter, you're referencing one quarter, I tend to look at a trend and look at it for -- a total year versus a total year, and then as new volumes, new things come on, it's a better way to look at than any one quarter or any one segment, sequentially.
Tristan Richardson: Sure. And then just, I think the implied multiple on the asset sales surprised a lot of folks and just sort of given the magnitude of the proceeds you guys expect compared with your outlook for CapEx. Do you anticipate the proceeds effectively take you out of the ATM market for 2019?
Jennifer Kneale: I think the Badlands transaction was incredibly important for us to get done. And the fact that we were able to get it done on the timeline that we did was also very important. So I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everybody that worked on it internally. To reiterate what I said earlier, Tristan, I think that we've demonstrated that we have a view that our equity is undervalued and have shown a strong desire to minimize how much equity that we issue at these levels. As we look forward, we're incredibly well positioned as we wait for a significant ramp in EBITDA, and we'll continue to proactively approach funding to the extent that we need to diminish leverage.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis from Crédit Suisse.
Spiro Dounis: Just one more on Badlands, hopefully just to what degree where those assets constrained on growth prior to the JV? Just trying to get a sense of this new JV actually allows you to fund that asset more and grow Badlands faster. And to what degree does that offer you new opportunities to, I guess, develop egress-type long-haul assets out of the Bakken?
Joe Perkins: Since you said JV twice, we probably ought to clarify. We recently did another JV in the Badlands as you would recall, which is how we're building the current plant. It was constrained prior to construction. We're building that with Hess and that's a Badlands JV. This additional investment by Blackstone is not changing the relationship of that first JV and it is providing funding, in my view, to the entire corporation. We're still going to pursue the attractive high-growth opportunities in the Badlands to the extent they are available. And we wish that that currently being constructed plant were up and running today because it is constrained. Does that help?
Spiro Dounis: Yes. I appreciate the clarification there. Second one, maybe I had a follow-up on Tristan's, but I think by our numbers, it looks like Badlands, their proceeds largely get you kind of all the way through '19 from an equity standpoint. And I guess, are you guys done selling assets at this point? Or could we see do a little bit more but maybe from one opportunistic reasons?
Jennifer Kneale: We've tried to be very transparent, particularly as our capital program has increased to tell you what we're thinking, when we're thinking it. I think that transparency has been very important for all of our investors. At this time, we are not in the process of selling any other assets. It's our fiduciary responsibly, if anybody calls us and wants to take a look at any of our assets to consider it, but no, we don't have any active processes underway right now, Spiro.
Joe Perkins: And Spiro, I hope as part of that transparency, what you also hear us say is the rapidly increasing cash flow. Second half of this year and into 2020, there's a whole lot to remove concern about funding. That's the best source. Okay?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Danilo Juvane from BMO Capital Markets.
Danilo Juvane: I had mostly follow-up questions. Firstly, Jen, with respect to guidance, do you see any visibility to potentially contract the splitter this year? Or are you fully embedding into guidance that the splitter will be running on a merchant basis?
Jennifer Kneale: I believe, we said in our scripted comments that we're working on both. So we're looking at commercialization of the asset, both for us and with third-party agreements. So it will -- may be a combination.
Danilo Juvane: But within guidance, what are you assuming, that it's merchant or fully contracted?
Joe Perkins: It's a modest merchant assumption at this time.
Matthew Meloy: We put in a conservative assumption. And part of the bread was, there was lower than the all-in payment that we expect to receive on a contracted basis. Current economics would actually imply that it would be higher than that. But we put in, just for start-up and timing and getting it ramped up, we put in a modest assumption below, kind of, below the current economics and below the previously contracted amount.
Danilo Juvane: Thanks for that Matt. My second question is with respect to the Bakken JV. Can you again explain what the MQD guidance is as it relates to the EBITDA guidance impact for 2019?
Jennifer Kneale: I think that what we said earlier is that because we received a significant upfront payment from Blackstone and because they're trying to derisk their investment as they move through time given the type of investor that they are. What that would imply with the minimum quarterly distribution, which they receive ahead of us, is that their share of distributions in the first couple of years is larger than what they would receive on a percentage basis thereafter. And that's fully incorporated into our 2019 guidance.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Becca Followill from U.S. Capital Advisors.
Rebecca Followill: First for all, I think, it's a change that you don't expect to have an equity stake, can you talk about the rationale for that at this point?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. That project, as we said all along, is a strategic project for us with the connectivity to our gas plants in the Midland, good takeaway from the Permian. Clearly, we're aligned to get more residue takeaway underwritten and done out of the Permian, so we can continue to make money on a G&P side, Grand Prix, fractionation and et cetera. There are other ways to support that project. So we are still working with the other potential customers and equity owners to support and get that over the line. You don't have to have an equity interest which will then bring capital required with that to support the project. So we're still working with them and hope to get that pushed over the line. But we -- just to be clear, we do expect no funding for '19 and don't expect to have any meaningful ownership equity in it.
Rebecca Followill: But you originally were going to be the operator of that pipe, is that no longer the case?
Matthew Meloy: I'd say, in our initial discussions, when we announced the deal, there's been changes for what partners have come in and come out. So there's been some back and forth on those items such as operating construction. Those details were being ironed out. So we're still negotiating those in coming to the right answer for that. So we were working on those all along the way. And so what we wanted to say here is because CapEx is a concern for investors on projects that you don't need to anticipate any CapEx relating to this project.
Rebecca Followill: Super. And then on -- one more on the Badlands. I know these are good assets and they're expected to grow, but we've all been through way too many cycles. So what happens in the event that oil does drop precipitously and these assets don't perform, are you obligated to pay Blackstone first, and then Targa second?
Jennifer Kneale: The part of the attractiveness of a fee-based system like the Badlands, Becca, is that we were able to demonstrate growth even during, at least, the most recent cycles that we've experienced and that helped to get our potential partners comfortable with the asset profile there. The minimum quarterly distribution to the extent that there are funds available to be paid out then Blackstone will be paid out first. To the extent that there aren't then those will accrue.
Rebecca Followill: Super. And then the last one is just on you talked about the rating agency treatment a bit, can be treated as equity. But in light of the CapEx budget going higher and EBITDA estimates coming down for '19 and I think covers looking fairly low. Any thoughts on how the rating agencies are thinking about this? Are they willing to bridge you to 2020 when things look maturely better? If you can comment on that.
Jennifer Kneale: We try to be incredibly transparent with the rating agencies over the last couple of years. We visited them more than we have in prior history. We've also tried to keep them informed and appraised of any developments as we've moved through. So I think at this point, we don't see any difference. We frankly spend a lot more time discussing with them that rapid EBITDA growth that we see back half in '19 into 2020 and 2021, and what that means for the overall enterprise.
Joe Perkins: And I'll just remember -- remind everyone, they get forecast for that. And then when we go into next time and the forecasts are even better, and we go into next time and the forecasts are even better, we've got pretty good credibility with them, on the rating agency forecast, which you could probably assume are at least among the conservative part of our range. That credibility with the rating agencies, when we walk in, they say that looks great, thanks again, appreciate the dialogue and sometimes they say, you are not our problem.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers.
Craig Shere: So just want to get clear on the EBITDA bridge relative to prior guidance. So the total backing out on the splitter combined with the disproportionate versus 45% interest of EBITDA accruing to Blackstone because there's minimum quarterly payments is a significant part of the bridge that would guide us to lower guidance net of the lower commodity deck?
Joe Perkins: We also said the only thing I think you may have left out is implied is that we had gone back, really bottom-up to try to do the best we could to understand what producer customers and downstream customers were doing in the new environment after the late November and December commodity price drop. Now that's an effort that we were able to do until a little past the middle of January when we started preparing it for our February board meeting. Just as our producer customers were doing the same thing, I think, we've done a reasonably conservative job on that. And that that change in activity associated with the new commodity price levels has been baked in the best we can.
Craig Shere: Right. So that left the volumetric issue. So would you...
Joe Perkins: No. With the volumetric issue, but had a Delta P in our best estimate of Delta V.
Craig Shere: Right. Now so my question is in terms of proportionality, would you say that the volumetric piece of it is perhaps in the area of the downdraft on the splitter?
Jennifer Kneale: Craig, I want to give more color on the individual pieces, we've tried to frame for you the key deltas. Number one, clearly, being the Badlands 45% minority interest sale. After that, we've got the Delta V and the Delta P. As Matt answered earlier on the splitter, we are assuming modest margin for that asset in 2019. Frankly, I think, we think that we can outperform potentially versus underperform depending on market conditions, but that's also an assumption that's made in there.
Matthew Meloy: And we don't have it completely up and running yet either.
Joe Perkins: Correct.
Craig Shere: Understood. On an ongoing basis this all, obviously, skews the EBITDA growth even more out to the next couple of years versus '19, in terms of your -- you're going to get more proportional EBITDA from the Badlands, eventually, something will be done with splitter. As we would expect that that proportional ramp to be much harder than previously?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. I think that's right with those items you outlined plus with the Williams deal. That's additional margin that's going to show up later as well.
Craig Shere: Okay. And now -- and I apologize if I'm reading the tables wrong. But was there a big shift in SouthOK volumes to Centrahoma JV? It looked like on a net basis, we had a drop sequentially though on a gross basis, volumes were up?
Joe Perkins: With some ethane rejection numbers going on in there too.
Matthew Meloy: Yes, there is. Yes, I mean, we brought on Hickory Hills in Q4. So there could be some noise around the start-up of Hickory Hills and rejection recovery related that we're being on inspect for takeaway issues in that. I'll look into that a little bit more but with increased volumes there.
Joe Perkins: There are moving pieces, the sequential may have some interesting numbers. It didn't jump out at me, but I often look at Oklahoma together. I would say that if you're seeing particular noise of those two things, the Hickory Hills start-up and changes in that rejection because it was moving around a bit.
Jennifer Kneale: But we'll follow-up you -- with you, Craig, if there's anything different than that, but I think that's the answer.
Craig Shere: Great. And my last question, just some clarity on longer-term volume perspective today versus third quarter. Do you still see a late 2020 or at least 2021 filling up of the initial 300,000 a day on Grand Prix still on the table?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. What we said was 250,000 barrels at some point in 2020. So I think we feel...
Joe Perkins: Good and better about that.
Matthew Meloy: Even better about that. This is the second, kind of, time we've talked about adding pumps and getting potentially up to that 450,000-barrel capacity. So I think we feel better about that guidance, although, we haven't updated that just to say we feel better about it.
Operator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference over to Sanjay Lad.

Joe Perkins: Thanks, Sanjay. Good morning, and thank you to everyone for joining. For the third quarter, Targa achieved its best operational and financial quarter in our history, positioning us to exceed the top end of our previously disclosed full year 2018 financial guidance and more importantly, providing positive momentum for 2019 and beyond. It's been a busy couple of months at Targa since our last call. During that short time, we successfully brought online our 200 million cubic per day Johnson Plant in the Midland Basin. The Johnson Plant was highly utilized at Targa. We continue to start off activities that are crude and condensate splitter at Channelview. We are now start-up. We closed $116 million asset sale of some of our petroleum logistics business. We raised about $200 million from the issuance of common equity under our ATM program, and we recently began strata of our 150 million cubic feet per day Hickory Hills Plant in the SouthOK system. Our major projects underway remain on track and many of these projects will be completed by the end of the first half of next year, which is now less than eight months away. We are working to complete all of our projects as quickly as practicable to help meet the increasing gas processing, NGL pipeline takeaway, fractionation and export services needs of our customers. Fundamentally, the robust near- and longer-term outlook for domestic production volumes from our basins and the outlook for crude and NGL commodity prices are providing continued tailwinds for our business and are leading to the high utilization of Targa projects we recently completed and those underway. Those same tailwinds are expected to continue to drive the need for additional Targa infrastructure. And on that note, today, I'm sure you noticed that we announced we are moving forward with the construction of two new fractionation trains in Mont Belvieu, Targa Train 7 and 8, which will add an incremental 220,000 barrels per day of much-needed frac capacity in the year 2020. We recently received permits for the fractionators, and as discussed in our last earnings call, had already ordered long leadtime items for prepare this. These additional projects aligned with our key strategic focus to continue to invest in attractive projects that leverage our existing infrastructure and further strengthen our competitive advantage and to continue to identify and pursue additional opportunities to further integrate our existing asset base. Both of these further enhance our attractive long-term outlook. The combination of our integrated asset footprint and our continued commercial successes drive the need for incremental growth projects, which underpin the attractive long-term outlook that we first presented in June of 2017. Since that time, as we previously described and listed, Targa continue to execute on commercial agreements and added projects that were additive to that published outlook. I'll resist or urge to repeat the long list of published deals and projects since June 2017. And of course, the rather smaller projects and deals that we did and publish. With that progress over the last 17 months, we now estimate adjusted EBITDA to be significantly higher than shown in the June 2017 outlook. And we have now provided you with a refreshed November 2018 outlook posted to our website this morning. For example, if you look at that outlook, this November 2018 version has estimated 2020 adjusted EBITDA of about $2 billion. And that about $2 billion level in 2020 is occurring one year earlier than when we first published in June 2017. We're also providing our preliminary 2019 estimated net growth CapEx of about $2 billion with growth CapEx declining significantly in 2020 and 2021. We are currently forecasting 2020 plus 2021 CapEx to be about an aggregate of $1.8 billion total. That $1.8 billion two year forecast total is inclusive of spending on three more processing plants after the plant and one additional frac after recently announced Train 7 and 8. We are providing this update to help investors better understand the significant incremental and aggregate growth from the previous outlook and from the incremental announced projects and commercial success since that time. My bet is that consistent with the state of assumptions of this outlook, it will confirm the modeling of those who study as closely. The outlook update also shows our hard-working Targa employees what they have accomplished together over the last 17 months. This is a really exciting time to be an employee at Targa, and it is also a really exciting time to be a long-term shareholder in Targa. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.
Matthew Meloy: Thanks, Joe Bob, and good morning, everyone. Commercial activity and production in many of our operating regions is continuing to increase, and we expect this positive trend to continue. In the Permian and Midland, our Johnson Plant came online late September and was quickly highly utilized with 750 million cubic feet per day Plant remains on track to begin operations in the first quarter of 2019 and is also expected to be highly utilized at strata. The next 250 million cubic feet per day Plant is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2019. With continued strong production growth outlook in the Permian and Midland, we have been proactively ordering long lead items for the next plant. Each of these plants will be interconnected to our multi-plant multisystem Permian footprint with the majority of the NGL volumes flowing through Grand Prix and to our fractionators in Mont Belvieu. In the Permian and Delaware, producer activity remains robust with inlet volumes increasing 13% over the second quarter, construction continues on our 220 mile high-pressure rich gas system, which will run through the heart of the Delaware Basin. A significant portion of this pipeline will be complete by the end of this year with the remainder being completed in phases throughout 2019. In the Badlands, our little Missouri complex is operating at capacity and our LM4 plant is expected online in the second quarter of 2019, as the timing of critical equipment availability pushed on site into the winter months. Gas gathering and processing, include gathering are expected to remain strong in the current commodity price environments. Turning to the Downstream Business, construction on our Grand Prix NGL pipeline continues and the project remained on time and on budget with the pipeline expected to be fully operational in the second quarter of 2019 to support NGL takeaway from the Permian, Southern Oklahoma and North Texas. Our outlook for Grand Prix continues to strengthen, and we have begun ordering long lead items for the pipeline's perspective expansion, which we expect will increase capacity of the segment originating from the Permian to approximately 400,000 barrels per day and as early as 2020. We will significantly expand Grand Prix's capacity with low-cost pump station addition incrementally as required, which further enhances the projects long-term value. The fractionation market is extremely tied, and our facilities in Mont Belvieu continue to run at capacity. We are utilizing our Lake Charles facility to enhance our operational flexibility, and we welcome the addition of our Train 6 fractionator, which will begin operations in the early second quarter of 2019. Train 6 was targeted to start operations in the last part of Q1 and has now shifted to the first part of Q2. We expect the fractionator will be fully utilized at strata. With a robust outlook for increasing Y-grade NGL supply to Mont Belvieu, especially from the Permian Basin and accelerating customer demand for fractionation services, as Joe Bob mentioned, we are moving forward with construction of two new 110,000 barrel per day Targa fractionation trains. Train 7 and 8 are expected to be online in the first and second quarter of 2020, respectively. Train 7 and 8 and related infrastructure are estimated to have a total cost of $825 million, a little higher than our previous average fractionator cost. These expenditures also include some infrastructure for the future. We expect to generate very attractive fee-based returns on these projects, supported by increasing Targa gathering and processing volumes and complemented by long-term contracts with producers and other third parties. In addition, much of the volume our fractionator expansion will be supplied by our Grand Prix pipeline underpinned by long-term contracts. During this period of market tightness for fractionation services, we are continuing to provide low assurance for our gathering and processing and downstream customers, we expect frac market tightness to persist into 2020 and given the strong outlook for continued volume growth thereafter, we expect the frac market to remain strong going forward. In support of continued supply growth of NGLs, we are ordering long leadtime items to increase our refrigeration capacity and low grades to further enhance our LPG export capabilities at our Galena Park facility. We now estimate that this enhancement along with previously announced additional pipeline between Mont Belvieu and Galena Park, our affective export capacity of 7 million barrels per month would increase by approximately 50%, depending upon the mix of propane, butane demand, vessel size and availability of supply among other things. And given our existing capabilities, this enhancement would come with relatively low cost and is already included in our 2018 and '19 growth capital guidance. We remain an active dialogue with existing and perspective customers for additional contracted offtake. We have added some additional contracted volumes and are working to add additional volume and term. Construction on the Gulf Coast Express residue gas pipeline or GCX continues, and the project remains essentially on time and on budget with the pipeline expected to be fully operational in the fourth quarter of 2019. Additionally, we are continuing to make progress on commercializing the Westward pipeline, which will provide incremental residue gas takeaway from the Permian to support the forecasted infrastructure needs of the basin and provide strategic receipt, delivery and access to premier markets for our customers. Our projects underway bolster our integrated midstream service offering to our customers. We remain on track to bring online a substantial portion of our organic growth projects currently under construction, including a number of processing expansions, Grand Prix and frac Train 6 over the next eight months, which provides us with increasing line of sight to significant growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash flow in 2019, 2020 and beyond. Targa remains committed to providing - to continuing to provide our customers with best-in-class service and reliability. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jen to discuss Targa's results for the third quarter and provide a financial update.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa has reported record quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of $358 million, which was 29% higher than the same period in 2017, driven by continued strong gathering and processing volume growth, higher commodity prices and higher downstream fractionation and LPG export volumes. Sequentially, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter increased 10%. We received the annual $43 million payment related to our crude and condensate splitter agreement in late September, increasing distributable cash flow for the third quarter to $287 million, resulting in dividend coverage of 1.24x. Without recognition of receipt of this payment, which has previously been paid and recognized in the fourth quarter, dividend coverage for the third quarter would have been 1.05x. The sequential increase in operating expenses was attributable to system expansions we have underway and the staffing of our new facilities. In our Gathering and Processing segment, operating margin increased $13 million in the third quarter when compared to the second quarter, driven by higher natural gas inlet volumes in the Permian, Badlands, SouthOK, WestOK and Coastal regions and higher crude oil gathered volumes in both the Badlands and Permian. Third quarter Permian inlet volumes increased 6% over the second quarter from growth in each of our Permian Midland and Permian Delaware systems. Badlands' natural gas volumes increased 5% over the second quarter with our little Missouri facility is operating at full capacity. Inlet volumes in SouthOK increased 3% over the second quarter as a result of continued growth in the Arkoma and SCOOP regions. WestOK inlet volumes increased 2% from increasing volumes from the STACK. During the third quarter, South Texas inlet volumes decreased 12% as a result of flooding from a high-level of rainfall. Volumes have since return to levels prior to the flooding. Our third quarter crude oil gathered volumes in the Badlands increased 16% over the second quarter, driven by strong production growth across our dedicated acreage. Permian crude volumes gathered in the third quarter were up 13% over the second quarter. The improved performance in our Coastal G&P business has been a predominantly driven by higher inlet volumes, richer gas, higher recoveries and higher NGL prices. In our Logistics and Marketing segment, operating margin increased to $44 million in the third quarter when compared to the second quarter, driven predominantly by higher fractionation margin and higher LPG export margin. Fractionation volumes increased 10% sequentially, averaging 455,000 barrels per day in the third quarter. At our Galena Park facility, for the third quarter, we averaged 6.4 million barrels per month of LPG export. We are very pleased with our operational and financial performance year-to-date and expect to exceed the top-end of our previously disclosed full year 2018 adjusted EBITDA guidance. The full year 2018 dividend coverage also on track to precede 1.0x. Moving to other financial-related matters, the fair value of the earnout payments for our Permian acquisition is currently estimated to be $329 million with the payment payable in May 2019. The $17 million increase in the contingent consideration compared to the second quarter estimate was driven by a shorter discount period. During the third quarter, we executed additional hedges for Targa's percent of proceeds equity commodity positions, based on our estimate of current equity volumes from field gathering and processing for the remaining quarter of 2018, we have hedged approximately 95% of condensate, 80% of natural gas and 75% of NGLs. And for 2019, we estimate that we've hedged approximately 75% of condensate, 65% of NGLs and 60% of natural gas volumes. At the end of the third quarter, our consolidated liquidity was approximately $2.6 billion. On a debt compliance basis, TRP's leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was approximately 3.8x versus the compliance covenant of 5.5x. Our consolidated reported debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 4.5x. In October, Standard & Poor's upgraded our credit rating to BB flat and raised the outlook to positive. Given the new projects announced today, we now expect 2018 net growth CapEx to be approximately $2.4 billion with about $1.9 billion spent through September 30. Full year 2018, net maintenance CapEx is now forecasted to be approximately $110 million with $79 million spent through September 30. And looking forward, as Joe Bob mentioned earlier, our preliminary estimate for 2019 net growth CapEx is around $2 billion. Year-to-date, we have raised about $1 billion of capital through a combination of joint ventures, asset sales and common equity issuance under our ATM program. Similar to 2018, looking forward to 2019, we expect to continue to utilize a multifaceted approach to fund our growth capital program with the benefit of having additional flexibility from higher EBITDA year-over-year as many key projects come online over the relative short term, and we will also have greater flexibility given our visibility to EBITDA continuing to increase beyond 2019. Additionally, as announced this morning, we are already in process with the select small group of counterparties to potentially sell a minority interest in our Badlands assets. Targa will continue to operate and commercialize the asset. We have a very strong team of employees in North Dakota and a very attractive long-term growth outlook for the business. Given the fee-based nature and long-term nature of our Badlands contracts, the strong performance of the assets and the improving outlook in the Bakken, we believe that monetizing a minority interest portion of this asset provide significant potential benefit to Targa without sacrificing operation or strategic control of the assets. We remain focused on continuing to proactively finance our growth program to maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility. As Joe Bob described earlier, if we look back to June 2017 when we first published a long-term outlook that illustrated Targa's EBITDA was expected to double from 2017 to 2021 and then consider all that we have executed on since then, including some minuses to help finance that growth like asset sales and joint venture interest sales, it is fair to say that the outlook for Targa is very strong. Our long-term outlook for published this morning highlights an expectation of rapidly increasing EBITDA from 2019 through 2021. The forecast assumption are consistent with what we put out last June, and do not include any unidentified projects, any assumed continuous commercial success or any assumed continued contract margin in our LPG export business. We are including to not yet announced highly likely incremental premium plans over the forecast period and an additional fractionation Train 9 estimated online in mid-2021, reflecting the need to handle expected volumes from already existing commercial agreements. We also highlight a list of additional growth opportunities, which are not included in the outlook for beyond 2021. Some of which are very tangible, like the acquisition of our debt JV interest and others that are left and sitting here in 2018 but are wholly expected will require continued strength in fundamentals, Targa execution and commercial success. This outlook reflects our expectation of rapidly increasing it midterm, which will result in a stronger balance sheet with increasing dividend coverage and additional free cash flow. Our current focus remains on executing on what we control, getting our projects in service, on time and on budget, continuing to perform commercially to add incremental opportunities in our underlying businesses and financing our growth in a prudent manner. So with that, Haley, please open the line-up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Shneur Gershuni of UBS.
Shneur Gershuni: With all the great information that you put out today, I kind of hate to start with such a technical question. But when I look at your guidance for 2020 and 2021, as I believe you said in the prepared remarks, this doesn't assume they out of the JV. So if we were to compare it to your original DevCo original guidance of to DevCo, this on an apples-to-apples basis, the number would actually be higher than where it is today. Who knows $100 million-or-so, but is that sort of the correct way to look at it if you sort of look at it compared to how it was before you let everything out with the DevCo?
Jennifer Kneale: That is exactly right. So if you think about the DevCo interest, obviously and some of the JV partially in the sales that we've done, or JVs of assets, those were not factored in previously. And so obviously on an apples-to-apples basis, this outlook would be higher if we assume that we haven't done any of those joint ventures or also we haven't executed any asset sales, obviously.
Shneur Gershuni: Thanks for the clarification. Just two quick questions here. Given our environment is today, specifically on the fracs, but in other areas as well. As you FID new assets and are added to the backlog, how have contract discussions gone? Are you getting longer terms in the higher fees? Are you sort of able to translate this market into better terms and ultimately higher returns overall?
Joe Perkins: Yes. Good question. We are getting obviously a lot of incoming with regards to fractionation related services for our downstream assets, and we are more focused on long-term. But fractionation deals that we have currently are typically longer-term by nature, 10 years or longer for some. For Grand Prix, there are long-term contracts as well. So we are working with our customers that may have short-term needs, made our longer-term needs and trying to work with them to provide the fractionation or transportation services, but do that for a longer period of time. Not just shorter time.
Shneur Gershuni: That makes sense. And just one last follow-up. Several of your peers during earnings season have talked about, you've able to turn screws to eat out some more capacity out of frac, work around on the NGL lines. I assume you're doing the same as evidenced by your LPG announcement today. Do you see any additional Brownfield opportunities in your fries or elsewhere you can achieve those very high returns that are better than your typical 5 to 7 average?
Joe Perkins: Yes. So we're always looking at our assets to see how we can potentially increase capacity. We are utilizing our Lake Charles frac even more, a wide range over there to frac. But we've also done just a minor in turnarounds or additional work our Mont Belvieu facility as well. We did a small in the summer way to get done a little while able to increase reliability and run time. So we have some other things like that on the drawing board, which we may be able to do as well. Those are relatively small incremental fractionation capacity, but with how tight the market is, we are turning over all the rock to see where we find any additional capacity.
Joe Perkins: We refer to some of those project in the previous call, and we didn't talk about the multiple, I think we would go so far as to say almost infinite returns.
Matthew Meloy: Yes. Not much capital, bring the frac down for the
Operator: Our next question comes from Colton Bean of Tudor Pickering Holt.
Colton Bean: Looks like 2019 EBITDA should been somewhere in the range of 15 to 17, can you just provide a bit more color as to what would one end of the range versus the other?
Jennifer Kneale: I mean, I think from our perspective, we spent a lot of 2018 talking about tightness in various places around the country that could potentially impact part of the business. So it is being about Permian constraints and issues that can potentially slowdown producer activity. That could be one. Obviously, commodity prices are big variables, if you think about some of the higher commodity prices that we experienced in Q3 to the extent that we enjoyed similar appreciation of prices throughout 2019. Obviously, that will trend towards the higher end of guidance and then obviously just activity levels around our system and our assets.
Colton Bean: Okay. Makes sense. Then Matt may be just circling back to the comments on Galena Park. Do you anticipate the 10 million barrels a month capacity has been sufficient to handle the volumes coming out of the fracs? And just looking at the expansion there, it was 320,000 barrels a day frac capacity if C3, C4 is kind of give or take 40% of that, it seems like you can nearly fill the expanded capacity, just with the fractionators?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. I'll actually turn it over to Scott to kind of give a little more color on that.
Scott Pryor: Yes. I think the way you guys should look at it from a perspective, the announcement of ordering long lead items for increased refrigeration capacity at Galena Park is in line with a number of other projects that we've already announced. One of which was a pipeline from Mont Belvieu down to Galena Park as well as a refurbishment of our dock at Galena Park, which was one of our older docs. The pipeline should be online in the first quarter of 2019. The refurbishment of the docs to be online mid-2019. That basically debottlenecks a lot of our capacity on behind the refrigeration unit to open up opportunities for increased moments of butanes, specifically but also enhances our ability for propane. Those types of projects and then moving forward with further refrigeration that would be adjacent to our existing footprint gives us significant refrigeration capacity. And nominally speaking, we are saying that gives us an increase of about 50%. We're spending dollars that moderate dollars in 2018, 2019 and 2020 in order to reach those types of capacities. But again to Matt's points in our script was that depending upon what types of products we are loading, whether it's butanes, propanes or loading both as well as the types of ships that we are learning, we see that we've got sufficient capacity based upon what we're seeing today. Now we will continuously look for opportunities to expand, add additional refrigeration if necessary over and above what we have announced today in order to handle those. The one thing that we get with our facility is and the reason why it's always depending upon the types of products we are loading is we can simultaneously refrigerate through our existing footprint and an expanding footprint both propanes and butanes at the same time. So you can see the reason why there is a varying degree of how much volume you put across the doc relative to those types of variables.
Colton Bean: Got it. That's helpful. And then, Jen, I guess, the final question...
Joe Perkins: Two quick adds. One, in case lost in our script, the capital, Scott referred to as moderate highly leverages our existing investment already in place and is in the forecast for 2018, 2019 and 2020 outlook. So the numbers are already in there making it kind of lonely moderate in my opinion. And secondly, there is a great deal of leverage by having the other infrastructure already in place and making incremental investments to expand our capacity. We had a really good about that, and it's power of the asset investment we've already made.
Colton Bean: Yes. That's helpful. And then, Jen, just any clarify on the Badlands or the potential Badlands minority sale? Is that G&P, G&P plus crude? Or are you guys looking at that?
Jennifer Kneale: Yes. We're looking at it as a partial minority interest sale Badlands LLC entity, which is the entity that owns all of both the crude and the natural gas gathering and processing assets up in the North Dakota.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet [ph] of JPMorgan.
Unidentified Analyst: I just have one question on the guidance assumptions. So looking at the Slide 9, can you provide some more color on the timing assumptions behind the incremental processing plants here? And also are there any other growth opportunities within these assumptions? And just as a follow-up to that, given the lot of processing expansions being added to the backlog, do you see any potential for pulling forward that Grand Prix mainline expansion ahead of 2021 at this point?
Matthew Meloy: I guess, I'll start Jen and then maybe you can go from there. So the underlying assumptions and then some of the upsides, we have our base volumes going through gathering and processing down Grand Prix in the fractionation, but will drive this higher if we get incremental deals with third-party, customers, producers, midstream companies. So this continued commercial success is something that could potentially drive those higher and could lead even more volumes on Grand Prix and into our fractionation facilities. We did talk about putting the lead times for the which would expand the capacity from the initial about 300,000 up to about 400,000 barrels. So that would be needed in this forecast.
Joe Perkins: In 2021, you said as early as 2020.
Matthew Meloy: Yes. Just to be clear, I said, we could have early as 2020. And in this forecast, we would need within that time period of 2021. We didn't give exact timing of when those three other plants that we mentioned on the processing side would be coming online, and you can think of it is kind of ratably after the announced plans come on kind of through that period. It is a reasonable estimate.
Joe Perkins: And the other fraction we did mention we did say 2021.
Matthew Meloy: Yes. And Train 9, I assume, that 2021. That's right.
Jennifer Kneale: Yes. That will contribute to EBITDA and forecast to 2021. We haven't described the timing of when the additional 3 Permian plans will come online, but obviously if you're modeling our expected growth out of the Permian should hopefully be fairly easy to predict when we need additional processing.
Joe Perkins: The way you asked the question, I also want to emphasize that there is no unknown, unidentified wage built into that, invest the additional upside, some of which are mentioned in the column to the right of Page 9.
Unidentified Analyst: That's really helpful color. Just a follow-up on those assumptions here. How are you guys looking at the volume guidance in Permian, like processing, - just the Permian volume guidance assumptions behind this, like until 2021? Is it going to be like 20% or sub like any color you can provide there?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. We haven't given the detailed guidance for '19 yet. We anticipate giving you more full summary view of how we see '19 shaking out the next quarter's earning call in February. So we'll probably provide some more blender information regarding '19. We wanted to give the early look for '19, but there are significant growth assumed in the Permian for this forecast, but we'll give you a little more detail in February.
Operator: Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis of Crédit Suisse.
Spiro Dounis: Just wanted to start off with funding all this growth and getting to that cash flow inflection that's coming. You guys appear to have a high visibility here just on the EBITDA itself given the nature of these products. Just curious to make sense to run maybe at higher leverage, know you talked about multifaceted approach, but could we see a little bit more going forward?
Jennifer Kneale: Spiro, this is Jen. I think certainly when we think about 2019, 2020 and beyond, obviously in the visibility that we have to ramp EBITDA gives us a lot more flexibility and one that gives us more leverage capacity as it is, but also I think would potentially give us additional comfort in letting leading leverage on a little bit higher for the quarter or quarters if we want to do. So we think about historically we funded call it 50%, 50% debt and equity, I think obviously we talked about 2018, we felt like we had a little bit more flexibility to potentially issue less equity than 50%. And going forward, I think, we have that same flexibility to go lower than that if we want, but obviously are always focused on prudently manage the balance sheet.
Spiro Dounis: Okay. And then just on LPG exports, you're obviously talking pretty positively about the outlook going forward we heard that from others as well. Just wonder if color on that market trying to give a sense of sentiment of the buyer side? And how much of that rate is really still arbitrage, driven or just may be more sticky type demand from things like eating and cooking?
Matthew Meloy: It's a number of things obviously that would add into that. We look at it from a couple of different angles. One of which, when you think about just look at from a domestic fundamental growth perspective. The growth that we're seeing on the upstream side, our gathering system, our gas processing plants, our long haul pipeline, the expansion that we see at our fractionation footprint and all this increase production that we're going to see domestically, while not seeing increased demand domestically for propanes and butanes means it has to find its way to the water. Because of our integrated footprint that allows us to make sure that, that doesn't have to jump off of our footprint in order to find whether the market place is. We have all the way down to the water's edge. As a result of that, that increase production will move that direction. So we're in a great position from that perspective. On the demand side, we're continuing to see growth obviously predominantly in the Far East. We've mentioned it before in other calls, if you think about the demand opportunities in Africa and India and certainly the continued growth that we're seeing in China and other areas in the Far East, those types of demand pools will obviously complement the increase production that we have through domestically within the U.S. And the U.S. is the only one that is growing with the needed supply to feed that marketplace. So it's a little bit of a supply push and a demand pull to a certain degree. And the marketplaces are becoming more and more accustomed to origination of supply out of the U.S. So it's both - it's domestic demand, its other fees to market basis, it's PDH demand. There's a lot of things that feed that, and obviously availability supply helps that growth from demand side, grow from there.
Operator: Our next question comes from TJ Schultz of RBC Capital Markets.
Torrey Schultz: Just first on your currently operated fracs, Matt, I think you mentioned the 10-year agreements. And I think you hit the end of the some of the current 10-year agreements through your 2021 outlook. But just how much of the contracted base agreements are expiring through that outlook? And what's expected in dealing with those as far as renewal expectations or trying to quantify the potential upside to raise just given the
Matthew Meloy: Yes. We have a portfolio of agreements, both T&F and Really in the short term, we provided this a few years ago and we said, we have a long-term contracts and there is really not that much of rolling coming up for renewal in the next 12, 24 months. So there is not a lot of contract that's going to able to come up to extend on the fractionation side. But with Train 6 coming on with 7 and 8, we do have obviously more capacity coming on. So we'll able to continue to execute longer-term agreements to satisfy that demand.
Torrey Schultz: Okay. And then if we just think about the NGL volume growth for transport and frac beyond - if we think about beyond payments coming online and third parties, is some of the existing transport commitments or other contractual invitations start to roll off by 2021? Or if you could just provide any context to when some of that occurs?
Matthew Meloy: So we have on the transportation side, we have a makes some volumes that we're going to be able to move off other pipes kind of Day 1 when Grand Prix comes on, some are shorter term, some made and some are very long term. So it's going to be - there is some that kind of moving over that we're going to get the benefit of that transportation in this time frame, but it is a portfolio that. So it's going to be moving overtime more and more to Grand Prix.
Joe Perkins: In reality, most of our new stuff, the vast most of our new stuff should be assumed as going on to Grand Prix.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dennis Coleman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Dennis Coleman: Just a lot of focus here on liquids, obviously and that's the opportunity, but I wonder if you might talk about, as you bring all this processing capacity on, obviously that's a lot of gas that needs to get the market as well. Is there capacity locked up for that gas? Or anything you can talk about there? I know you have the GCX interest, but anything additional opportunities there?
Matthew Meloy: I'm going to turn it over to Pat to answer that one.
Patrick McDonie: Yes. We did participate in GCX and obviously everybody in the world is talking about the Permian residue gas takeaway situation. GCX comes along in October of next year, as we also announced that too far in the distant past, we are working on the project Wister pipeline, which would move an additional to BCF day out of the Permian. We are very active. We have a lot of contracts and markets to take away our gas and make sure that our customer's gas. Our customers also have contracts to get it through those short period of potential interruptions across the Permian. If you think about it throughout the winter time, you got a lot of consumption of gas both well sites and obviously consumption of gas from the general population out there. It helps alleviate some of that problem. April through October of next year prior to DCX coming online, it's going to be an interesting time frame. We like we position ourselves to make sure. But everyone moves, there will be issues in the Permian and less America that haven't seen yet, and we will continue to work on Wister and that project forward and obviously that's hopefully the next solution for continued growth over there coming years of residue gas in the Permian.
Joe Perkins: Dennis, your question about how much is firm has a multiyear component, has a short term. In the short term, we have the vast, vast majority of our of what we characterized the spot. We have to have a little bit of flexibility, because there is variability in producer supply across days and across weeks. But we are managed that for a long time and we're far more than we have ever been and have flexibility with gas daily type stuff to manage always unexpected variations in producer volumes. So we're in a good position. We think our customers are in a better position with Targa than with most other players in the Permian, for example.
Dennis Coleman: Great. That's very helpful. My follow-up, if I can, just a question on cost of capital. Obviously, you've talked about using a variety of funding method, the DevCo you used this year. I wonder is that still part of the arsenal? Is the Badlands potential sale? Would it have any kind of potential buy back? Is it similar? Or is it right sale? And then lastly, it does look like you assume a fairly high interest expense as you go across your renewed or updated budget. I just wonder as the S&P leading on positive, is there a thought that you will more towards investment grade and that while it's not a EBITDA impact it should could be a DCF impact of that interest expense ended up being lower?
Jennifer Kneale: So it's a quite a follow-up question, Dennis. I think that from our perspective, obviously we entered 2018 describing a multifaceted approach to financing. And frankly spend a lot of time in 2018 end of 2017 describing what that could mean in terms of public capital, common and preferred or private capital or potential asset sales. And then obviously go through 2018, really utilizing a number of those different tools that were in our toolbox. So as we look forward to '19 and beyond, obviously the increasing EBITDA, I think, is partially what will be very advantageous to us as we think about how to finance this growth program. We also announced the partial interest sale in the Badlands. Obviously, that would potentially help from a financing perspective. Related to the DevCo, that was a very nice structure that we did and we got four years of flexibility to buy back those JV interest, which I think is a very favorable structure to us. I think that if I had to rank where that is on the list right now, we'll probably a little bit further down just because we've already done it. And so when we think about our outlook and our increasing EBITDA, I'm not sure that would be #1 on my list in terms of what we may do next. Obviously, we're announcing today that given we're evaluating a minority interest sale in the Badlands, that's potentially first on my list here. And then related to your follow-up question part about the interest expense that we assume just in EBITDA or reconciliation the backhaul presentation, obviously rates are going higher, LIBOR is higher. So we're just taking a conservative approach to those assumptions there. I think we're very pleased with the S&P upgrade and motive positive outlook as well. try to spend a lot of time with the rating agencies over the last couple of years to make sure that they understand the story that's unfolding here, and I think we've done a good job of working together with them and so ultimately we'll see where the path takes us, but obviously the outlook that we have put in front of you last June and then now refreshed year stronger in November of 2018 highlights the fact that we're going to have a very flexible balance sheet going forward. And obviously that could mean that in the future investment grade is a step that we take, but it's obviously one that we want to take when the company is good and ready. And I think it will frankly, be much more a factor related to our results, getting us there more so than anything else.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tristan Richardson of SunTrust.
Tristan Richardson: Just circling back to the announcing LPG export capabilities with the refrigeration and the regional line Mont Belvieu. Is there a feeling to think about in terms of export capabilities before more significant capital deployment would be required?
Matthew Meloy: In our outlook, we're really expanding in phases, right. And Scott talked about we're putting in the end each line between Belvieu and Galena Park and we are going to add refrigeration. We're doing some doc work. I don't know that we have done engineer this thing to say what the ceiling is. I mean, we can keep wondering to incrementally remove bottleneck. So we see this type of adding refrigeration gives us good run rate 200 additional liquids coming off of fractionation. If we need to do more, we can continue to expand those bottlenecks.
Tristan Richardson: That's helpful. And then should we think about the enhancement underwritten by customers or more just general optimization to accommodate the supply push?
Matthew Meloy: It's both. When you got a facility as large as you have a role of contracts that are coming up and we are entering into a new one. So it's hard to necessarily poise this contract with the expansion of the business and how things are running. We're continuing to add contracts. We're working to add more than add more term. So we're not fully contracted, but given the volumes that we see coming across our facilities and the outlook and discussions we're having for additional contracts, we feel really good about the returns about this expansion. We didn't really talk about the capital, but it's probably around $100 million, $125 million of total capital for this refrigeration. So we're going to see good returns depending upon how you think about the time line for going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Stanley of Wolfe Research.
Keith Stanley: Sorry, if I missed this. But is the 2021 outlook include or exclude the Whistler pipeline?
Jennifer Kneale: The 2021 outlook does not include the pipeline.
Keith Stanley: Okay. And just a follow-up on that pipeline. With moving forward on 2 pipes now, are you seeing less urgency from customers to kind of act and commit now to Whistler? Or is that still being actively developed?
Matthew Meloy: The answer is no. We're not seeing less interest, and it is being actively develop.
Operator: And our last question for today is from Sunil Sibal of Seaport Global Securities.
Sunil Sibal: Couple of questions for me in the marketing and logistics segment, quarter three seems like you had a pretty strong quarter and typically you've seen a fair bit of a seasonal uptick in that segment going into the winter months. I was wondering how should we kind of think about that in the next couple of quarters considering what you reported today.
Matthew Meloy: Good question. We do have some seasonality in our wholesale business, which has led to typically stronger Q4 and Q1 relative to 2 and 3. So we still have some seasonal factors in there. What we saw in Q3 though was just really strong volume across both our fractionation facilities and our export doc, and we did have some short-term opportunities in the fractionation business, which helped us as well. And it's tougher to say what that's going to look like in Q4, but we still do have some of the same seasonal factors, wholesale business and then we will just have to see how Q4 shakes out. We would certainly expect volumes across the fractionation across exports to continue to be strong, and this is really shorter-term and opportunities play out in Q4.
Sunil Sibal: Okay. And then in terms of the longer-term guidance that you laid out, couple of clarifications on that. What's sort of commodity price assumptions underlying that?
Jennifer Kneale: There's a footnote on the page assumes $50 per barrel of crude WTI, $2.75 per MMBtu and natural gas and $0.70 per gallon for NGLs.
Sunil Sibal: Got it. And then just lastly in terms of the leverage metrics, where do you see exiting 2021 in terms of the leverage with all the guidance that you laid out?
Jennifer Kneale: I think from our perspective, when you think about this outlook and think about our goal of having consolidated leverage in the 3 to 4x range, we are not going to give additional guidance or clarification on exactly what we expect sort of point in time leverage to be at the end of this forecast. But this is a very strong forecast with a lot of additional free cash flow beginning in '19 and '20 and then 2021. So I think from our perspective, when you think about us delivering there is on term outlook that we have no refreshed again this morning, it would mean that our balance sheet is in very, very good shape at the end of this outlook.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Sanjay Lad for any closing remarks.

Joe Bob will begin today's call with a few highlights followed by Jen who will discuss second quarter 2018 results, and Matt will then provide an update on commercial and business development before we open it up for questions. I will now turn the call over to Joe Bob Perkins.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Sanjay. Good morning and thank you to everyone for joining. I want to begin today actually by honoring one of Targa's retired founders and my good friend Roy Johnson. Our Permian Johnson plant is named after Roy. For those of you who have not heard, Roy was killed in a tragic bicycling accident in late July. Targa would not exist if it were not for Roy's vision and inspiration. Roy had been retired for several years. But his legacy remains. And many of us will always have Roy's example in our heads and in our hearts. Roy is enjoying this fine earnings report from better place, but he will always be missed. When this year began, a lot of external focus on Targa was related to our attractive growth capital projects and for a while perhaps even more so related to our ability to effectively finance our growth capital program underway. For the first few months of the year, it became even more of a heightened topic as we announced additional attractive new projects requiring additional future CapEx. I believe that now as Targa has continued to execute on our projects and on our financing plans through the first half of this year with major projects on track with the prospects for those projects even better than when we announced them and with us already having funded our minimum equity needs for our 2018 growth CapEx program, the conversation appropriately shifts more to focus on the strength of our asset footprint and the growth profile that is rapidly coming into view as we move thorough this year and into 2019. Many of our important projects underway will be completed by the first half of next year, less than one year away. And we are working to complete those projects as quickly as practicable because the demand for processing pipeline takeaway fractionation and export services continues to increase. Fundamentally, the strengthening outlook for domestic production volumes in crude and NGL commodity prices is providing additional tailwinds for our businesses. And, will accelerate the utilization at the projects underway. And, will continue to drive the need for additional infrastructure. Our operational and financial performance through the first half of this year has its own track to meet or exceed our previously disclosed full-year 2018 guidance. And more importantly, our longer -term outlook for Targa continues to strengthen and continues to gain momentum and visibility. Our continued focus on execution across the company was demonstrated recently by a number of successful highlights. Successfully bringing online our 200 million cubic feet per day Joyce plant in the Midland Basin, which was essentially pulled [ph] at startup; commencing operations of our 60 million cubic feet per day Oahu plant and our 250 million cubic feet per day Wildcat plant, which will support the expected volume ramp in our Delaware systems; expanding our joint venture partnership with Sanchez in South Texas to include a new long-term dedication by Sanchez and by all their working interest partners for over 315,000 additional gross acres in the Western Eagle Ford further strengthening the long-term outlook of our assets in the area. Announcing our participation in an additional strategic residue gas pipeline called Whistler to very effectively linked growing natural gas supply from the Permian Basin to key demand markets along the Texas Gulf Coast further enhancing Targa's Permian Basin asset positioning and midstream service offerings to our customers. Raising more than $300 million for the issuance of common equity under our ATM program during the second quarter, which combined with our financing efforts earlier this year means we have funded our minimum 2018 equity needs. We have funded our minimum 2018 equity needs without the likely benefit of some catalog asset sales. And extending our TRP and TRC revolvers and increasing the size of our TRP revolver to $2.2 billion to support the future liquidity needs of our business. This revolver, the largest for any high yield company in the midstream industry with very attractive terms, also highlight the support that we continue to receive from the bank community. So, our strategic initiatives are driven by continued commercial execution, project execution, and financial execution like those examples. And the growth projects and related execution focus support high level of confidence in the future; confidence from increasing line of site into strong long-term outlook at Targa. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jen to discuss Targa's results for the second quarter.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks, Joe Bob. Good morning everyone. Before we discuss second quarter results, I would like deliver a special Targa shout out to the many people in the field, accounting and elsewhere in our organization who have put in significant extra effort during our recent financial systems implementation while also balancing daily business priorities. Your efforts and amazing attitude will benefit our organization and are much appreciated. I would also like to thank our vendors and customers for their patience and support as we make this important change to support our organizations over the long term. Moving to our results, Targa's second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $326 million which was 26% higher than the same period in 2017 driven by continued strong gathering and processing volume growth, higher commodity prices, and higher downstream fractionation, and LPG export volume. Distributable cash flow for the second quarter was $225 million resulting in dividend coverage of around one time. Sequentially adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter increased 6% over the first quarter. In our gathering and processing segment sequential operating margin increased $21 million driven by higher natural gas inlet volume in the Permian, Badlands, North Texas, and SouthOK, and higher crude oil gathered volumes in the Badlands and Permian. Second quarter Permian inlet volume sequentially increased to 8% from growth in each of our Permian Midland and Permian Delaware systems plus the addition of volumes for processing at the Joyce Plant that were previously being offloaded to third party. Badlands natural gas volumes increased 17% over the first quarter with our Little Missouri facility now operating at capacity. Inlet volumes in North Texas sequentially increased 5% as we benefited from incremental short-term volume, a trend which we do not expect to continue as we look through to the balance of this year. Inlet volumes in SouthOK increased 4% over the first quarter driven by new commercial arrangements and continued growth in the Arkoma and SCOOP region. Our second quarter crude oil gathered volumes in the Badlands sequentially increased 19% driven by strong production growth in the basin. Permian crude volumes gathered in the second quarter were up 35% over the first quarter. In our logistics and marketing segment, the sequential decrease in operating margin of $9 million was predominantly attributable to seasonality in our marketing businesses and was partially offset by lower operating expenses. Fractionation volumes increased by 6% sequentially averaging 412,000 barrels per day in the second quarter. At our Galena Park facility, we averaged $5.8 million barrels per months of LGP exports which was the strongest second quarter in recent years driven by improved seasonal fundamentals. Moving to other finance related matters. The fair value of the earn-out payments for our Permian acquisition is currently estimated to be $312 million with the payment payable in May 2019. This $61 million reduction in the contingent consideration compared to the first quarter estimate is driven by a decrease in underlying volume forecast expectations over the remaining short measurement period. During the second quarter, we executed additional hedges for Targa's percent proceeds equity commodity position. Based on our estimate of current equity volumes from field gathering and processing for the second half of 2018, we hedged approximately 90% of condensate, 80% of natural gas, and 75% of NGL volume. And for 2019, we estimate that we have hedged approximately 75% of condensate, 65% of NGL, and 60% of natural gas volumes. On June 29, we closed in on the amendment and extension to 2023 of both the TRP and TRC revolving credit facilities. The TRP facility was increased $1.6 billion to $2.2 billion demonstrating strong bank market demand and we were able to lower borrowing cost relative to the prior facility. The TRC facility size remained unchanged at $670 million. At the end of the second quarter, our consolidated liquidity was approximately $3.1 billion. On a debt compliance basis, TRCs leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was approximately 4.0 times versus a compliance covenant of 5.5 times. Our consolidated reported debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 4.5 times. Our current 2018 net growth CapEx estimate remains unchanged from our previous update and is approximately $2.2 billion with just over $1 billion spend through June 30. Full year 2018 net maintenance CapEx is forecasted to be approximately $120 million with $46 million spend through the second quarter. Related to funding our capital program, we have been very successful utilizing a multifaceted financing growth and are well positioned from a balance sheet perspective looking forward. On our first quarter earnings call in early May, we announced that we had reached $87 million through our ATM program and given we had no project announcements or other events to put us in a blackout for the balance of the second quarter, we are able to raise an additional $283 million for a total of $370 million raise year-to-date by our ATM program. The ATM continues to be a very useful tool for us and our second quarter capital raise demonstrates our access to capital as a liquidity corp. The combination of our ATM proceeds, our DevCo JV financing and the sale of our inland marine barge business means we have raised approximately 630 million through the first seven months of the year which is about 30% of our 2018 net growth CapEx budget. We also continue to make progress on the potential sale of terminals in our petroleum logistics business which would further supplement our financing program and allow us to deploy capital into more creative opportunities. We provided 2018 financial and operational guidance in February to provide some level of insight into our expectations for continued year-over-year growth. Our performance year-to-date in 2018 has been strong and we expected to continue. But our preference is to avoid quarterly updates to that guidance because we believe investors are better served by focusing on our incredibly attractive long-term value proposition with each passing quarter when we close the 2019, when a significant number of our growth projects will come online given a outlook in 2019 and beyond of increasing EBITDA, increasing operating leverage and lower CapEx coupled with demonstrated access to public and private capital market, means we are very well positioned to finance our growth capital going forward. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt to provide an update around the execution of our strategic priorities and our business outlook, Matt?
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Jen, and good morning everyone. Commercial activity and production and many of our operating regions is increasing and we expect this positive trend to continue. In the Permian the Joyce Plant came online and with almost immediately felt. Our 200 million cubic feet per day Johnson Plant is expected to be complete in late September and will be highly utilized when it comes online. Inlet volumes on our Permian Midland systems increases 11% sequentially and the 25 sequential increase on our Permian Delaware systems would have been 5%, had we not been impacted by some scheduled plant downtime in our Versado system. In the bad lands, our little Missouri complex is operating at capacity and our LM4 Plant expected online around the end of the year is already much needed. Turning to the downstream business, the frac market continues to tighten and we expect transect to be fully utilized when it comes online in the first quarter of 2019. Our channel view crude and condensate splitter will begin operations around late September and early October. Permian takeaway for all commodities is tighten -- tightening and we are closely monitoring this to proactively manage such issues for our customer volume. We believe that Targa customers are relatively well-positioned and are based in infrastructure constraints caused by growth rate even more robust and expected will be temporary mitigated by economic and other logistical factors. The short-term impact of takeaway issues on Targa's volume growth should be on the margin of continued robust recent growth rate. We are already seeing some natural activity moderation that still expects strong growth from this area. Jen mentioned that volume forecast associated with our Permian acquisition resulted in the decline and the estimated are now payment. I would like to point out that the volume growth associated with the acquired assets is still in a very high double-digit and is expected to continue well beyond the earn-out period. Construction on Grand Prix continues and the project remained on time and on budget with a pipeline expected to be fully operational and supporting NGL takeaway from the Permian, Southern Oklahoma and North Texas in the second quarter 2019. Construction on GCX also continues and the project remained on time and on budget with a pipeline expected to be fully operational in the fourth quarter of 2019 which will certainly provide some much needed relief on the residue side moving volumes from Waha to El Paso. Our focus across our asset base continues to beyond getting infrastructure place to support the needs of our customers and when you think about the projects that we are now investing in 2Bcf of additional processing capacity, a 100,000 barrels per day of additional frac capacity. Grand Prix, GCX, Agua Blanca, WhiteWater target is clearly committed to continuing to provide our customers with best-in-class service, reliability and optionality. 2018 growth CapEx is at historically high level for Targa, largely as a result of Targa's single largest capital project in Grand Prix and all the necessary processing ads across our gathering and processing footprint. When we think about projects beyond what has already announced, the tightness in fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu and the outlook for NGL volume to Mont Belvieu is accelerating customer demand. Our fraction facilities at Mont Belvieu operated near full during the second quarter, partially offset by some de-bottlenecking we undertook to enhance system reliability and operational flexibility. Fractionation capacity at Belvieu is expected to remain very tight through 2019 even with our transect factoring coming online. We continue to progress on permitting additional fractionation and have begun ordering long lead-time items to best position ourselves to move quickly through construction once we have our permits on hand. We also continue to enhance our connectivity to our petchem customer's abilities and are well-positioned to capture an increasing share of this demand growth as new petrochemical facilities move towards diversifying their connectivity to supply. Collectively, we remain on track to bring online the substantial portion of our organic growth project currently under construction including a number of processing plants, fracture and fix and Grand Prix within the next six to 12 months which provides us with increasing line of site to significant growth and adjusted EBITDA and cash flow in 2019, 2020 and beyond. Looking ahead, we expect capital expenditures to be focused around incremental processing expansions which will generally direct incremental NGL to Grand Prix and drive additional fractionation in LPG export expansion opportunities, which require significantly less capital investment directly linked to the increasing volume through our systems. We remain focus on executing on these projects that we have underway and on securing attractive sources of financing that enhance and maximize longer term shareholder value. Our balance sheet and dividend coverage are expected to strengthen significantly as our project underway is completed in the near-term and as our EBITDA increases. We are very excited about the outlook for Targa and its shareholders. So with that Operator, please open the line for questions
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from TJ Schultz of RBC. Your line is now open.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning, TJ.
TJ Schultz: Hi, thanks. Hi, good morning. I think just first on the Permian, just as you discussed some moderation maybe in Permian activity, not surprising just given the takeaway, is there any change to your view on Grand Prix volume potential by 2020 at all, and as you think about the expansions there, are you still moving forward with the longer lead time items to prepare for with that extension?
Joe Bob Perkins: I want to be clear. The moderation is moderation in a growth rate, okay, not moderation in a volume. It's a very active area, we're growing production through our Gathering and Processing, growing production from there, very soon to Grand Prix, third-party volumes to Grand Prix. You asked if there was anything different in our outlook. When we initially announced this project we are significantly better. And I think everybody who's been monitoring the basin and our success know that in an outlook for Grand Prix. We have been ordering long lead-time items for all of our important projects, and that would include for Grand Prix. The long lead time items to expand Grand Prix are not expensive. The purchase of pumps and the installation of pumps is a small fractional addition on that project when necessarily.
TJ Schultz: Okay, understood. On Delaware volumes in 2Q, the Versado downtime that was planned and you mentioned, was that continued just in 2Q and just what would you expect or would you expect kind of catch up back into 3Q?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, so that was, as we mentioned, the sequential growth, we had 2%, it would've been 5%. So on average for the quarter is about 12 million a day, which was impacted on the Versado system. So we would not expect that impact in Q3. Our longer-term outlook for that area, whether it's the Versado or even just anywhere in the Delaware is kind up into the right, we've said for the acquisition kind of very high single digits. We're seeing strong growth out there. It's just frankly happening a little bit slower than our estimates at the beginning of the year.
TJ Schultz: Okay, thanks. Just lastly on financing, have you satisfied the ATM for 2018 already? Can you just expand on the flexibility you have for financing into 2019, whether it's maybe pre-funding that on the ATM? Do you prefer to tap some of the private capital again, and just expectation on closing the asset sales this year?
Joe Bob Perkins: TJ, before I turn it over to Jen to answer that, I just wanted a crack. I said high single digits growth rate for the acquisition, it's actually high double-digit growth rate. So I just want -- I wanted to correct that. Okay, Jen?
TJ Schultz: Got it, thanks.
Jennifer Kneale: I think when we look forward, I think consistent with our track record, we're going to continue to proactively manage our funding to maintain the balance sheet flexibility that we've really worked very hard to get through a number of actions since 2016, and 2017. We're really pleased with the success that we've had thus far, year-to-date, tapping a number of different tools to raise capital. And I think that's what you should expect going forward. That's been very consistent with our messaging over the last year, plus. And I think that's how we'll continue to approach it going forward, utilizing a multifaceted approach.
TJ Schultz: Okay, just on the asset sales, is there still the process in place there to try to get that done this year.
Joe Bob Perkins: I called it likely.
Jennifer Kneale: Yes, absolutely. So we announced that we are evaluating the sale of our Baltimore Sound and Channelview Terminal. And so there's been a lot of interest from the market for those assets. And we are continuing to proceed through the process. Our expectation is that the assets are likely to go to more than one buyer in more than one transaction. And so it'll just take us a little bit of time to work through all of that.
TJ Schultz: Okay, thank you everybody.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay, thanks, TJ.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: Just want to start off the Whistler Project here, I was just curious. I know it's still kind of early innings here and there's only so much you can share. But as far as proportionate ownership in this project, would you like to kind of link that to what levels of volumes you'd be committing? Is that kind of how you think about how this would fit into your portfolio of growth longer-term?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, so we haven't given specific equity percentages for the pipeline. But I think generally thinking about it the equity ownership related to the MVC commitment is a good way to think about it in general.
Jeremy Tonet: Great, thanks for that. And then, Matt, kind of building off from your comments there with the ramps of the Permian plants. In the Delaware with Wildcat and Waha there, was just wondering with the ramp. How do you guys see, I guess, Permian takeaway constraints? Do you see that kind of influencing the ramp there or have you guys kind of locked up the FT where you feel good about being able to place all your molecules on other basin?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, there's really a lot that can be said on that. I'd say as far as producer activity and the volume ramp, we've got a diverse set of producers, whether it's in the Delaware, Midland, and each and every one are kind of evaluating the different takeaway constraints a little bit differently. There's oil, NGL, residue, there's different constraints, and different producers have different options depending on their portfolio of production. We have seen some producers that have a good footprint in other basis, say, instead of adding the rig here in the Permian we're going to add to maybe the Bakken or somewhere else. But we have seen some of that. Are there going to be impacts? We think there's going to be some impacts, as we said in our script. We think those are going to be on the margin to a growth rate. So we still do see strong growth in 2018 and into '19. It's just how much that growth rate will be impacted. And it will vary by producer. And that's something that we're going to have to kind of work out as we go through time and so are.
Jeremy Tonet: That's helpful, thanks. And then, Jen, just wanted to touch the finance a little bit here. And clearly Targa has a very deep portfolio of attractive growth projects here. But just wondering as far as the CapEx spend here, is this kind of like the first-half of '18 is like the pig in the python, like this is the high watermark as far as CapEx spend. It looks like the back-half of '18 is stepping down a little bit versus the first-half of '18. And I know you've not given 2019 guidance yet, but just -- would you expect that to kind of trend down a little bit or anything else you can share there?
Jennifer Kneale: Sure, Jeremy. So I think the pig in the python, I have heard Joe Bob say before, so I'm sure if you got that from him. But I think we've…
Joe Bob Perkins: She said people -- doesn't understand that.
Jennifer Kneale: I said Canadians, really. Look, I think from our perspective we've spent a little over a billion dollars year-to-date. I think that you can expect that that pace will continue, particularly as you think about the timing of when projects come online early in '19, such as Grand Prix and others. I think from our perspective, we've obviously taken a number of important steps already with the private capital, with some public equity, and with some strategic joint ventures. And I'd expect that that sort of multifaceted approach will continue as we look forward to funding 2019, when we'll obviously benefit from increasing EBITDA from the projects that are coming online either this year or next year. And I think that's what gives us the confidence, really, going forward when we think about the long-term outlook to finance our business.
Jeremy Tonet: That's helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay, thanks, Jeremy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colton Bean of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is open.
Colton Bean: Good morning. So just switching gears here a little bit to the NGL marketing, it looks like we've had a couple of strong quarters here, and actually had lower seasonality than we would've expected in Q2. Can you just provide a little bit of context on what's driving that, and maybe the sustainability of those results?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, I guess there's a couple of pieces there. I mean we have for the wholesale propane business, again which is a smaller part of our business. So I'd say we have pretty regular seasonality. And there's been some downward pressure in Q2 and Q3 for that business. But what you saw was an uptick in fractionation volumes, just strength in overall volumes through our system on the fractionation side provided some uplift to our margin. And you actually saw NGL exports, our LPG exports relatively strong compared to last year, even though it was sequentially down in Q1, we're just seeing continued strength in the export business.
Colton Bean: Got it. And then just to Whistler, so maybe a question for Jen here. In the release you mentioned the likelihood of project financing. Would the intent be to retain cash to reduce the debt load or would you guys look to pay out distributions after covering that interest burden?
Jennifer Kneale: I mean I think from our perspective Whistler as a project, just given the nature of the contracts associated with it, meaning that it's a very attractive candidate for project financing. So that's why we think that that is logical option for us to consider as the project moves forward. When we think about what we are going to do with our additional cash flow, as our EBITDA ramps, looking forward I think we very consistently have been saying that our goal is to increase coverage, reduce leverage. But really we're a little premature in getting to that point and being able to directly point to what we think we're going to use that additional cash flow for.
Colton Bean: Okay, and I guess just a last one from me here, so maybe a little bit limited in terms of disclosure around what you guys can do on the hedging strategy. Looking at next year you do have a little bit of a step down from Waha and Permian Basis swaps. Is any of that concentrated, and in terms of maybe Q1 through Q3 given the FD that you guys have on Gulf Coast Express, or are those numbers the daily average is kind of rateable across the year?
Joe Bob Perkins: We haven't said that they were rateable across the year. We provide that annual guidance very consistent with our previous approach, how we are managing the particular basis we're taking into account, the timing associated with GCX and we also are taking into account our longer-term view likely timing of that as part of managing that overall exposure.
Q – Colton Bean: Understood, I appreciate time this morning.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks, Colton.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni of UBS. Your line is open.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning.
Shneur Gershuni: Good morning. Just to start-off, maybe you step back a little bit and look little bit bigger picture, I mean we're seeing kind of the surge in overall NGL production, I believe in your prepared remarks you talked about tight frac capacity, there is some thoughts about need for more LPG export capacity, can you frame for us what the impacts are to Targa beyond what you already announced thus far, does that pre-come online at its fully expanded capacity that you had originally outlined, do you steer capacity away from Belvieu like Lake Charles for fracs and even on the LPG export side, I know your guidance doesn't include spot volumes but are there opportunities to expand there or fully utilize the LPG export facilities?
Scott Pryor: This is Scott. I'll try to tackle some of that laundry list that you put out there and obviously get help from my colleagues here. But first and foremost when you think about the NGL growth you look what's happening in the Permian both in the Midland and the Delaware side as it relates to our plants as well as third-party activity that's out there, a lot of that is feeding into Belvieu today, so overall picture relative to the tightness that we alluded to and our comments around fractionation capacity and the tightness in the marketplace filling up that fractionation capacity is very evident today. Some of that's related to new growth, some of that's related to ethane recovery and all of that together has moved to a point where Belvieu really is going to be tight as we said through 2019. From a Targa perspective, obviously we've tried to be in front of this with the announcement earlier about our Train 6 expansion which will be online at the end of the first quarter 2019 and obviously we indicated in our notes today that we are actively pursuing permits for multiple fractionators that once we have those in hand and the advent of long lead items purchased, we will execute on those projects as quickly as possible to bring that capacity online as well. So all of that really is a great picture for us, it's a great picture for the industry and certainly when you look at it steered towards Mount Belvieu where we got a significant footprint of both storage and fractionation and then our export capacity, we feel all that would be moving towards capacity limit at some point. We also have been ahead relative to announcing projects in earlier quarters where we were increasing our capabilities particularly around increasing our capacity on exporting butanes. So pipelines entering wells at Belvieu increasing that capacity basically redoing or rebuilding a dock at our facility to make sure that we've got full capacity on all four of our docks to maintain that level of flexibility. At what point, we will continue to look for small projects as well as large projects on the export side to enhance that capability, certainly our expenditures to enhance our capacity is much from a capital spend is much smaller than say a Greenfield project, so we will continue to look for ways to do that and be there when the market demand surpasses.
Shneur Gershuni: Thank you for all that color, maybe switching gears a little bit in terms of your overall outlook through 2021, I think on the last call that you had mentioned that you could potentially hit the $2 billion target earlier than 2021, given today's results and given your overall outlook as to how you're seeing things, are you more confident in potentially hitting that target earlier than expected the same was just wondering if you can give us some color around that?
Scott Pryor: I understand the question, what I try to describe was components of that long-range outlook that we developed and May of 2017 and talking about those components and new components all of which we feel better about today than when they were announced, So yes I've got very high confidence in that curve that was created some time ago, that high confidence in the curve is due to clear views of what are now short term projects. A whole lot of it coming down in less than a year and how we've commercialized them since announcement, so yes I'm going to tell you oh I'm confident in it. Super confident in it and that probably should translate into likely higher, likely earlier without giving you a new number for that. I hope that's helpful at all we disclose.
Shneur Gershuni: Yes, I appreciate and it definitely is helpful and one final question for Jen in terms of funding another this question is coming up just pacifically with the potential for the splitter sale, does it need to come online before you're able to market the project as for sale just wondering if you can sort of give us a little bit of color around that?
Jennifer Kneale: Well, importantly I remind you so what we said that we're evaluating the sale of were three sort of discrete terminals, so obviously the channel we occurred in condensate splitter but also our terminals up and down Washington as well as our terminals in Baltimore and sort of directionally we have said that when you think about asset op margin contribution from largest to smallest. It sort of splitter then sound and then Baltimore, we have done feedback from some buyers that they may prefer to see the crude and condensate splitter fully operational in order for us to maximize the value that we think, the asset is worth and so that's one of the things that we are obviously balance thing as we work through the evaluation of the sales of that particular terminal and really all the turmoil.
Shneur Gershuni: In your comment before I think you said that it late 3Q early 4Q when they start to start up this?
Jennifer Kneale: That's right and that said sort of late September early October.
Shneur Gershuni: Perfect, thank you very much. Appreciate all the color guys.
Matt Meloy: Thanks.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Darren Horowitz of Raymond James. Your line is open.
Darren Horowitz: Matt in your prepared commentary you talked about increased in dual recoveries and obviously on the ethane side, we seen regional ethane for expert economics improved with the expectation that should continue into the end of this year how much of a benefit from just margin capture perspective, do you think that could lead or drives for you guys in the back half of the year. I know, I previously you've talked about in nickel moving composite NGL space is still a few big plus or minus $9 million. But I'm more specifically wondering from the ethane potential what that could mean?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, so we haven't given any hard metrics for enhanced ethane recovery, relates to EBITDA for us. We would benefit generally from higher ethane prices would benefit the GMP side of the business and then more volumes through our fractionation facilities, so it is generally positive for us as recovery picks up and we have seen then. Will benefit even more once Grand prix comes online to mid next year with what we're able to capture both the transportation in the fractionation will benefit more from that but we haven't kind of given any, the hard numbers for what that can look like. I just say generally more recoveries are beneficial for us.
Darren Horowitz: Okay and then switching over to your comments around the there was a project and the proposal there. To your point on residue gets taken out of the Permian and a lot of I guess converging effectively -- and then moving into the area, how do you think about the potential scale for Whistler and commitments versus what the competing projects for example like Permian highway could achieve in the timeline across with both of those pipes marketed?
Scott Pryor: This is Scott. I mean fair question obviously there's two competing projects and if you think back over the last year and a half as many as 13 or 14 projects announced. As Matt alluded to the kind of the formula or a recipe for getting a project done has been a volume metric commitment for an equity position in a pipe. Certainly kind of mortgage got a valid project as do we, do both of them get done I can't answer that. I really don't know what they've got left to do but I certainly have one aside on our project. We have really good commitments in place from industry players that have a lot of experience and a lot of growth in their forecast for the midstream, sort of the business they participate in and honestly in the conversations we are having incrementally we feel very good about the project, we got to get it done, we like where it initiates we like where it terminates into the marketplace both feeding Mexico and the growing LNG markets and so all we can do is stay tuned and we expect it to get done.
Darren Horowitz: Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay, thanks Darren.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tristan Richardson of SunTrust. Your line is open.
Tristan Richardson: Hi, good morning guys.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning.
Tristan Richardson: Just mentioned de-bottlenecking opportunities on a fractionation side and Scott you mentioned sort of looking those opportunities up and down, can you talk about what those activities could add or have added on the capacity side for fractionation and while we wait Grand Prix?
Scott Pryor: What I would say is that, it's a variety of projects obviously as you look into your facilities you are going to look for ways to improve the operation across the number of fractions that we are already are operating today. With that said, I'm not going to give you a volume outlook or what that looks like, what I would tell you is a lot of that focus was on reliability and sustainability as these volumes start ramping up we want to make sure that we have long run times without any bubbles in our system to ensure that we are performing for our customers at a highest degree and as a result of that we think that we become a very attractive player in the marketplace and continue to be attractive player for our customers on the downstream side.
Joe Bob Perkins: Tristan, I want to chip my hat to the team. First of all, having a high beam zone to be looking for those opportunities prior to being completely utilized and getting that work done at the right time to prepare for that very near future of completely utilize. This was big bang for the buck investment in that cycle and it was well executed.
Tristan Richardson: That's helpful. Thank you, guys. And then, just you guys talk about opportunity for processing capacity additions and frac capacity additions given what Whistler would add, with the idea to generally be to time any incremental opportunities with what you are expecting on my day Whistler to be or given how tight we are on the frac side, would there be opportunities to pull some of those expansion forward ahead of Whistler?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, I think when we think about growth and our GMP business and then further downstream, we think a bit more kind of as we are adding processing plant as GMP inlet volumes are growing, that's going to be the driver for additional NGL production which would then necessitate further investment downstream on fractionation or potential export expansion. To Whistler part of those volumes are from the residue gas takeaway from our processing plants that we are adding but there is also as you self-explanatory in the list you know, additional equity owners in that pipe, there is supply coming from many different areas for Whistler. So I kind of decoupled that and think about more in the adding processing plants from the GMP side and the startup of Grand Prix to even better fees.
Scott Pryor: Yes, exactly.
Tristan Richardson: Okay, helpful. Thank you guys very much.
Scott Pryor: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Phillips of Guggenheim. Your line is open.
Matthew Phillips: Good morning guys. I just want to touch on the fractionation side a bit here in terms of this past quarter in the trend there I mean volumes have continued to tick up but frac revenues have come down and how -- is more of this being allocated to commodity sales versus a pure fee-based arrangement. I mean, how should we look at that going forward?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, when we think about fractionation business, it's we think about as it's basically a fixed fee business. There is a piece of the fractionation business which is a pass-through that we talk about which does hit revenue and OpEx, so the gas prices dropping that can impact our revenues and then impact our OpEx and things like that. So we really tend not to focus too much on revenues that can -- there is going to be some noise in revenues, do you think a bit more on our growth margin and really on an operating margin basis.
Matthew Phillips: Got it. I mean, so does that imply to pick volumes or going to have more seasonal sensitivity, right, and if you are just getting a fee for fractionation services, I mean, is this, I mean is this different? Sorry go ahead.
Joe Bob Perkins: It is a fee based business but you don't see 100% of the fee in the revenue without a de-dock in the expense and we can walk you through that a little bit more.
Jennifer Kneale: Yes Matt, this is Jen, Sanjay and I can walk you through the different components because I think where you are getting your number from there is some noise in there but I think we can help you through.
Matthew Phillips: Okay, that works. And then on for balance Bakken side of things, it's pretty huge step-up in volumes here year-over-year, just given the trend of Permian moderation growth more folks are moving to other basins, would you guys see the Mid-term outlook here and do you see further upside in the JV with us?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, I'd say we feel really good about our outlook up in North Dakota. We've seen volumes increase, the LN-4 plant come online fast enough, so there is the need for additional processing capacity out there not just by us but by others, so we're working to put that in place, I think our expectations for filling up that facility really just continues to improve as we go through time. So the outlook out there I'd say is good and even getting better.
Matthew Phillips: Okay, thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning, Craig.
Craig Shere: Your financial outlook…
Joe Bob Perkins: Craig, we only heard two words.
Jennifer Kneale: Yes, we only heard financial outlook.
Craig Shere: I'm sorry, is this better?
Jennifer Kneale: Yes.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, we can hear you now.
Craig Shere: Okay, looking at slide 9, your financial outlook long-term there is two things that jumped out of me, one is obviously it's over year since you issued the main part of the chart and second all those add-ons on the right and other couple announcements you're not going to be able to fit on one page. So my question is and I appreciate you want to keep your cards a little close to invest and not update every other quarter but could you see by the fourth quarter call refreshing this?
Jennifer Kneale: Well, before you say the other piece of that's I do hope jumps out is embedded in the footnote which is that when we develop this guidance it was based on a $50 crude environment flat through the forecast period and $0.60 NGLs flat through the forecast period, so that to me is also one of the, sort of key component pieces that really jumps off the page. I think from our perspective when we think about that long-term outlook we're in a period where we really need to execute, so these projects that we've now been talking about for 18 months plus key projects like Grand Prix. We need to get them online and then you'll start to see really in our results. The impact of such accretive and attractive opportunities and as we move through the balance of this year, move through the balance to 2019 there just more and more incremental projects that are going to contribute. I think from our perspective obviously our investors would like for us to be updating in this real time and we understand that but we do tried to give you a lot of directional color, that we certainly feel like a lot has improved since then. It begins with commodity prices and then the associated volume projections that we made in a $50 per barrel flat crude environment obviously that has improved since then as well and then we've had already a commercial success is that you rightly point out will need to follow a smaller font if we add any more projects on the next go around.
Craig Shere: Okay, this fair enough and you're absolutely correct Jen and planning out the commodity benefits and then also the fact that you didn't include anything that was contracted out the LPG export side it's just seems that the long-term street outlook may be unrealistically conservative still and a little help from you guys within the next couple of quarters might be useful.
Joe Bob Perkins: Understood, long term Street outlook is also not out five years. We worked hard to try to create a view and then outlook in calling it an outlook for folks who want to look beyond that quarter index and we're going to keep trying to add more information, part of that information Jen's pointing out will be actual very soon, with the start of many of the important projects occurring in less than one year. Here your advice we will try to take it to heart, we started up the question would be likely be reprinting this chart next quarter, I think because we've answered it several times that people should hear that we're unlikely to be reprinting this chart and redoing it completely in the next quarter. But as I answered Shneur, you do here the compact okay, you hear that we got line of sight on that curve by improved why it's becoming shorter and shorter term and that that confidence probably does mean that we believe it's above the curve and or earlier which was another way the question was asked and we'll take the question to heart we want to provide information and see what it does.
Craig Shere: Great, just one more quick question on the capital funding, Jen to the degree that you are successful with the downstream trillion logistics asset sales, do you see that's kind of a downpayment on first half 2019 spend as you think about beyond that obviously having a much more power of funding with how declines of CapEx and huge increases and retain Dcf?
Jennifer Kneale: I think from our perspective, we view funding really as fungibles. So there isn't a line in the sand that we think by ex-date we want to complete it 2018 financing and then we can sort of begin to look forward to 2019 or beyond. I think in our view what we're trying to do is maintain the balance sheet flexibility that we've worked very hard for and as a result of that balance sheet flexibility, we may or may not fund our CapEx program with as much equity as we historically have particularly with the EBITDA ramp that we can see before us. But I think we'll just continue to move through time using the multi-faceted financing approach, I think the potential sale of our terminals business is an important piece of that but everything remains a tool available to us and I think we've demonstrated to our track record our willingness to utilize different tools and so I think that's what we will continue looking forward.
Craig Shere: Understood, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport. Your line is open.
Sunil Sibal: Hi, good morning guys and congratulations on a great quarter.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks.
Sunil Sibal: Yes, couple of questions from me first going to the food gathered volumes in Permian seems like what is strong sequential pick-up in those volumes, just I'm wondering is there any timing issues there or is that kind of could ramp-up that we can assume for the remainder of the year?
Jennifer Kneale: I mean our Permian crude business is obviously a relatively new business for us that we acquired through that with our acquisitions and so you're starting from a small base, so as our commercial team continues to make progress and they executed number of very attractive contracts, you'll continue to I think see volumes increased from there whether we're not going to provide obviously guidance on such a small piece of our business but 35% up to quarter-over-quarter is very nice for that business and we expect it will continue at the activity in the Permian continues.
Sunil Sibal: Okay, got it. And then some of the competitors in the midstream space talked about got pressures on steel tariff considering that you have a fairly robust capital program I was wondering it was starting to see some of that impact also.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, so for our project that's are on the drawing board that pipe was already ordered and done, so we don't have an impact or current capital budget earning material impact our capital budget for those items. Going forward for new processing plans, new facilities, the actual feel causes are relatively small component of the overall infrastructure whether it's a processing plan or fraction facility, so we don't see any material impact from the cost in steel tariffs.
Matt Meloy: And year two out not get any précised numbers at average target plan to out there this cost the plant purchase fees is probably 15% to 20% of that access that were most of the steel is in the plant and the steel is call it notionally 20% or 30% of that 15% to 20% and there is some other steel but that you can see how an increase in steel I saw someone publicly say may impact our steel prices by 20% to 30% is not going to be but single digit impacts on our cost and that's manageable within new contracts and new deals as we go forward.
Sunil Sibal: Okay, got it. Thanks a lot guys. That's all I had.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay, thanks.
Operator: There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Sanjay Lad for any further remarks.

I will now turn the call over to Joe Bob Perkins.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks Sanjay. Good morning and thanks to everyone for joining. It's been a busy couple of months since our last earnings call and I believe that the announcements that we made since mid-February are examples of the strength of execution across our organization. Commercially, we announced significant additional Delaware Basin processing expansions supported by long-term fee-based agreements to provide gathering, processing and downstream transportation, fractionation and other related services with a well-positioned investment-grade energy company. Importantly, part of our expansion is to construct new high-pressure rich gas-gathering lines across some of the most attractive acreage in the Delaware Basin. And that new pipe positioning is already betting additional fruit or otherwise, we would not have been able to compete before. We've already contracted with additional producers, have verbal commitments from others, and expect additional dedications over the coming months. We also announced that we're expanding our Grand Prix NGL pipeline further north into Southern Oklahoma. That expansion is supported by volumes from our current and future Arkoma plant and via significant long-term transportation and fractionation volume commitment from Valiant Midstream. Valiant is a private midstream company that put together a very attractive, very large, dedicated acreage position in the Arkoma STACK. We issued $1 billion of senior notes at an attractive rate in a choppy, high yield market in early April, which demonstrates the continued strong support of Targa's business by our high yield investors. We announced in early April that the 200 million cubic feet per day Joyce Plant has been successfully brought online. The Joyce plant was on-time and on-budget and provides much needed relief to a system that has been operating over capacity in the Midland Basin. We also recently brought the 60 million cubic feet per day Oahu plant online in the Delaware Basin, adding incremental capacity as volumes continue to ramp in our Delaware systems. And this morning, WhiteWater Midstream announced that Targa made a small 10% equity and secured strategic space on their project financed Delaware Basin to Oahu pipeline. Also in April, we announced that we retained Evercore to evaluate the potential divestiture of our petroleum logistics business and that process is ongoing. And this morning, we announced that we recently executed agreements to sell our Inland Barge business for about $70 million. That's an example of us identifying some less strategic assets that could be sold for an attractive valuation with the proceed used to help fund our ongoing highly strategic capital program. These public announcements, coupled with year-to-date execution on multiple other fronts, support our key strategic initiatives, which include; investing in attractive projects that leverage our existing infrastructure and further strengthen our competitive advantage; proactively financing our growth program to maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility; and continuing to identify and pursue additional opportunities to further integrate, strengthen, and grow our existing asset base to further enhance an already attractive long-term Targa outlook. Our capital program is expected to generate significant cash flow growth as the various highly visible projects become operational. The longer term outlook that we provided last June is even better today. Looking back at the outlook provided at that time, the fundamentals are currently stronger, including more activity and higher oil and NGL prices we developed the outlook nearly a year ago. Plus we have had a year of additional commercial success that was not included in that outlook. And since that time, Targa has announced significant additional growth projects that were not included and that clearly leverage our existing asset base. We are well-positioned to deliver attractive returns to Targa shareholders over the longer term, supported by our focus on execution and on continuing to provide best-in-class midstream services to our customers. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt, and Matt will provide an update on commercial and operational execution and our business outlook. Matt?
Matt Meloy: Thanks Joe Bob and good morning everyone. Commercial activity and production in many of our operating regions continues to increase and we expect this positive trend to progress throughout 2018 and beyond. Compared to the fourth quarter, first quarter Permian inlet volumes increased 3% even with the freeze-off related impacts in January reducing first quarter average Permian inlet by approximately 2%. Volume have since more than recovered with estimated average April Permian inlet volumes already 8% above the first quarter average. For a total field G&P, estimated average April inlet volumes were 5% above the first quarter average. In the Permian, we continued to execute on our growth program and remain on track to add an incremental 710 million cubic feet per day of new processing capacity in 2018. In the Delaware Basin, a 60 million cubic feet per day Oahu plant is online and we expect to begin commissioning our 250 million cubic per day Wildcat Plant later this month. Both plants are interconnected with multiple other plants and systems across our Permian Basin footprint. Our recently announced Delaware Basin expansion include the 220-mile high-pressure rates gas header system and two new 250 million cubic feet per day cryogenic natural gas processing. The Falcon and Peregrine plants are scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020 respectively. As part of the agreement, underpinning the expansion plan, Targa will also provide transportation services on Grand Prix and fractionation services at its Mont Belvieu complex for a majority of the NGLs from the Falcon and Peregrine Plant. Without our multi-plant system that spans across the Permian Basin, Grand Prix, and our fractionation assets and our reputation for best-in-class midstream customer service, we would not have been successful in executing these agreements. The integrated midstream service offering that we're able to provide to our producer customers in the Permian is exemplified by this deal. On the Midland side of the Permian, production growth continues at a rapid pace. We're running some of our West Texas facilities above nameplate capacity to meet the processing needs of our customers, while also offloading to other target systems and third-parties and the Joyce plant coming online provided some much-needed system relief. Our expectation for our 200 million cubic feet per day Johnson Plant are similar. It is anticipated to begin service in the third quarter and is also expected to be highly utilized when it comes online. As a result of the production trends that we're experiencing and continued production growth forecast from our customers in the first quarter, we announced that we're moving forward with construction of two new 250 million cubic feet per day cryogenic plants in the Midland Basin. The Hopson plant will begin operations in the first quarter of 2019. The Hopson plant is being named after the late Steve Hopson, former Targa SVP of Operations and Engineering. Steve played a key role in Targa's early history, development and growth, and he is very much missed. After the Hopson plant, the Pembroke plant will begin operations in the second quarter of 2019. Similar to our other plants currently under construction, these plans will also be interconnected with multiple other plants and systems. A substantial majority of the NGLs from are newly announced Targa plant will be transported over time on Grand Prix to our fractionation assets in Mont Belvieu, LPG export facility on the Houston ship channel, and other downstream outlets, further increasing the organic growth across Targa's integrated footprint. Moving to our Oklahoma assets. Our 150 million cubic feet per day Hickory Hills plant, which is part of our Centrahoma joint venture with MPLX, will support growing natural gas production from the Arkoma Woodford Basin and is on track to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2018. In late March, we announced the extension of the Grand Prix pipeline in the Southern Oklahoma, which will integrate Targa's G&P positions in SouthOK and North Texas to Targa's Mont Belvieu complex. The extension is supported by significant long-term transportation and fractionation volumes dedication from Targa's existing and future processing plant in Arkoma area and SouthOK system. Additionally, the extension is also supported by significant long-term transportation and fractionation commitments from Valiant Midstream. Valiant is a leading private midstream energy company whose position in the highly prolific Woodford formation is backed over 1.8 million of committed growth acreage within an area of mutual interest. Valiant's initial system, infrastructure, which is expected to phase in during the second quarter of this year will span across multiple counties in Southern Oklahoma and will include the installation of our 200 million cubic feet per day cryogenic processing plant and a high pressure trunk lines spanning through the basin's liquid-rich fairway. In the Bakken our outlook continues to strengthen our activity remains robust on our dedicated acreage and as we benefit from increasing production levels. Estimated April crude gathering volumes averaged about 140,000 barrels per day, representing a sharp increase over the first quarter levels. Construction of the new 200 million cubic feet per day plant at our existing Little Missouri facility through our 50-50 joint venture with Hess Midstream is well underway and will help meet Targa and Hess' growing production needs. The LM4 plant is on track to be complete in the fourth quarter of this year and is expected to be highly utilized over the next year after it commences operations in early 2019. Turning to our downstream business. The outlook for our logistics and marketing business continues to strengthen, supported by strong supply and demand fundamentals. We expect higher field G&P inlet volumes, an increasing ethane recovery to drive higher fractionation volumes. And we expect this trend to continue in 2018 and beyond. In the first quarter, our volumes increased 26% over last year volume. The fourth quarter outperformance and fractionation volume that did not carry over into Q1 was attributable to the impacts of Hurricane Harvey as we fractionated some of our additional inventory in the fourth quarter and also had higher third-party export volumes from fractionating some of the excess inventory build of our peers. We completed a schedule turnaround of our CBS Trains 1 through 3 in early April. For the remainder of the year and beyond, increasing G&P volumes are expected to result in increasing Y-grade volumes available for fractionation. To accommodate this growth, our 100,000 barrels per day Train 6 fractionator is under construction and is expected to be highly utilized when it begins operation in the first quarter of 2019. Benzene volumes were lower in the first quarter and while we continue to receive take-or-pay payments related to the contractor we have in place for benzene treating through 2018, we're going to repurpose our facilities into additional low-sulfur natural gas treating over time given the increasing demand for LNG. The EBITDA impact from these reported volume changes is the deminimus. Shifting to our LPG export business. We averaged 6.1 million barrels per month of exports at Galena Park during the first quarter and April volumes were similar to first quarter. Our long-term outlook is largely unchanged the long-term fundamentals remain robust for the U.S. LPG export, driven by international LPG demand growth and continued strength in growing LPG supply from the U.S. We have an attractive multiyear contract position and the interest in multiyear contracts continues. We're enhancing our capability and flexibility at Mont Belvieu and Galena Park to meet customer demand as we continue construction and add infrastructure at Mont Belvieu and Galena Park including a rebuild of our older stock at Galena Park. These enhancements give us additional capability to export more LPG volumes, depending upon vessel size and product mix. The Dock 2 rebuild will be concentrated during the second and third quarters of this year and will have minimal impact on our operational capacity at Galena Park. Construction on Grand Prix continues and the project remains on-time and on-budget with the pipeline expected to be fully operational in the second quarter of 2019. As announced in late March, volumes are currently expected to exceed 250,000 barrels per day in 2020. Grand Prix is expected to provide significant and increasing fee-based earnings over the long-term and we are well-positioned to stage incremental low-cost expansions that will further enhance project economics to Targa. We're well-positioned to expand Grand Prix by adding stations prospectively when required. As an example, the estimated cost to fully expand Grand Prix capacity from 300,000 to 550,000 barrels per day from the Permian and 450,000 to 950,000 barrels per day in the Mont Belvieu would be less than 10% of the originally announced project costs, providing Targa with capital-efficient growth opportunities that will generate attractive returns. As it relates to residue gas takeaway, Targa is one of the largest aggregators of natural gas in the Permian. Our investment in GCX helps solve some of the gas takeaway constraints from the basin and will direct the gas to premium markets. Additionally, our aggregated positions in excess of GCX are well-positioned to negotiate reliable and competitive future gas takeaways for our producers. You have also seen a press release from WhiteWater Midstream yesterday that we're now at 10% equity owner in the Agua Blanca pipeline in the Delaware Basin. Construction of the pipeline is being largely project financed. So, for a deminimus amount of capital, we secured an interest and attractive process that enhances our ability to transport volumes in the Delaware to Oahu. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jen to discuss Targa's results for the first quarter.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Good morning everyone. Targa's reported adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $307 million, which was 11% higher than the same period in 2017. Continued strong gathering and processing volume growth in the Permian complemented by higher volumes in Badlands, South Texas, and SouthOK, along with higher commodity prices and higher fractionation volumes drove the increase in adjusted EBITDA over the prior year, partially offset by declining WestOK and North Texas volumes. Reported net maintenance CapEx was $22 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $25 million in the first quarter of 2017. Distributable cash flow for the first quarter was $216 million, resulting in dividend coverage of about one times. Sequentially, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter decreased 7% over the fourth quarter. If we normalize and exclude EBITDA that shifted from Q3 to Q4 as a result of the impacts of Hurricane Harvey, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was about 4.5% lower than the fourth quarter. In our gathering and processing segment, operating margin decreased by $13 million in the first quarter when compared to the fourth quarter. Higher natural gas inlet volumes in the Permian, South Texas, Badlands, and Coastal were more than offset by lower NGL prices and higher operating expenses due to new assets and system expansions. First quarter Permian inlet volumes sequentially increased 3% from growth in each of our Permian Midland and Permian Delaware systems and as Matt mentioned, volumes would have been higher by approximately 2% pro forma for the freeze-off experience in January. Inlet volumes in SouthTX sequentially increased 14% as we benefited from both volumes from Sanchez and from the producer contracts acquired with the Flag City assets. In the Bakken, first quarter crude oil gathered volumes were largely in line with the fourth quarter and were modestly impacted by the timing of well completions. Permian crude volumes gathered in the first quarter were up 10% over the fourth quarter. In our logistics and marketing segment, operating margin decreased $15 million in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter as higher wholesale propane operating margin was more than offset by lower fractionation volumes due to the unusual outperformance in the fourth quarter, as mentioned, lower treating volumes and higher OpEx. LPG export volumes were strong in the first quarter as we averaged 6.1 million barrels per month of export at Galena Park. Our first quarter results were consistent with our expectations and we have no changes to our 2018 financial and operational outlook. We continue to expect Permian inlet volume to ramp throughout 2018 as production growth continues and new Targa plants begin operations. And we expect the same volume growth trend to translate to our downstream fractionation business. We expect adjusted EBITDA to also ramp throughout 2018 with fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA being the highest was the year. Moving now to the financial related matters. The fair value of the earn-out payments for our Permian acquisition is currently estimated to be $373 million with the entirety of the payment forecasted for April 2019. No payment is due related to the March 2017 through February 2018 measurement period. The $56 million increase in the contingent consideration versus the fourth quarter estimate is attributable to an increase in underlying volume expectations and a shorter discount period. During the first quarter, we executed additional hedges, and for 2018, we estimated we have hedged approximately 90% of condensate, 85% of natural gas, and 80% of NGL volumes based on our estimate of current equity volumes from our field G&P contracts. Our natural gas hedges include regional basis hedges. For 2019, we estimate that we have hedged approximately 65% of natural gas, 65% of condensate, and 45% of NGL volumes based, again, on our estimate of current volumes from field gathering and processing. As Joe Bob mentioned, in April we issued $1 billion of 5.78% percent senior notes due in April 2026. Net proceeds from the senior notes offering were used to reduce borrowings under our revolver TRP and our accounts receivable facility. Pro forma for the senior notes offering our consolidated liquidity was approximately $2.7 billion. On a debt compliance basis, TRP's leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was approximately 3.9 times versus a compliance covenant of 5.5 times. Our consolidated reported debt to EBITDA ratio was approximately 4.6 times. Our current 2018 net growth CapEx estimate remains unchanged from our previous update and is approximately $2.2 billion. Full year 2018 maintenance CapEx is forecast to be approximately $120 million. Consistent with our messaging, since our November earnings call, we're focused on identifying the most attractive ways to fund our growth capital program given the visibility that we have to increasing EBITDA looking forward. Year-to-date, we received $87 million of net proceeds from the sale of common equity under our ATM program and believe that the ATM is a useful tool for us given our liquidity as a Corp. The execution of agreements to sell our barge business and the potential divestiture of our petroleum logistics business, highlight our willingness to sell assets to deploy capital into more accretive opportunity. Our confidence in our multifaceted financing approach is supported by the DevCo joint ventures that we announced in early February, our notes offering in early April, which both demonstrates our continued access to private equity capital and public debt capital at attractive course, and significantly reduce our funding needs for 2018 and 2019. We continue to receive strong support and future interest from both sources to provide us with additional capital. We remain focused on executing on the projects, and we have underway to bring our projects in service on-time and on-budget, and also continue to be focused on securing attractive sources of financing that enhance and maximize longer term shareholder value. As we look forward and consistent with the long-term outlook that we published last June, our balance sheet and dividend coverage are expected to strengthen significantly as our projects underway are completed and our EBITDA increases and we're very excited about the outlook for Targa and its shareholders. So, with that, Heather, please open the line up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your line is open.
Shneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning everyone.
Matt Meloy: Hey good morning.
Jennifer Kneale: Hey Shneur.
Shneur Gershuni: Just wanted to start off. When you laid out your five-year plan last June, you've announced a series of projects since then. I realize each one of them is smaller in nature, but cumulatively it's been a large capital increase. You also signed a large acreage dedication at the same time. Directionally, I was wondering if you can give us some color on how your outlook on the five-year plan has changed. Do you see getting to $2 billion EBITDA earlier? Or is there another way to characterize it, that you expect to go up by a couple hundred million dollars? I was just wondering if you could give us any color on that.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes Shneur. You're probably aware that we get that question often and it's understandable that the markets would like a monthly update on our rarely given long-range outlook. What we do put in the page in our investor presentation is the factors that have changed since about a year ago. And I described that briefly in my comments. Significantly better industry fundamentals, activity, expected production and commodity prices for NGs and crude. Secondly, commercial success over the last year. We continue to have traction, leveraging our existing position and making that existing position better. And then as you mentioned, the significant number of projects that were not included when we laid that outlook out in May of last year. And then we articulated those as they've occurred, as commercially we created the success of the dedications and announced the projects on the upstream and downstream that were necessary to meet our midstream customer's needs. All of that is very positive good news. You've suggested that we probably get to the $2 billion sooner. I think that that's a very reasonable conclusion. But I'm not providing when we get to that. It's just directionally it has to occur sooner. And I hope that satisfies investors on the phone call today. I know that many have done their own analysis and they're coming to a conclusion similar to yours.
Shneur Gershuni: Great. As a follow-up specifically around the quarter, OpEx and G&A costs were up specially if you look relative to volumes and so forth. Is it fair to assume that these costs were associated with the startup of the new plants and that we'll see the operating leverage going forward as those plants ramp to full run rates?
Jennifer Kneale: That's right Shneur. I think when you think about the year using the first quarter as a decent run rate just given that we have a Joyce plant come online, we've got some other plants that are coming online this year is a reasonable assumption versus trying to exponentially grow it from here.
Shneur Gershuni: Okay, great. And then finally, the Outrigger liability increased. Can we assume is fair to assume that it's due to higher volume expectations? And you've also seem to have a lot of frac volumes continue to be up. Is capacity getting tight there and pricing be going up there as well?
Jennifer Kneale: On the first piece of that related to the Permian acquisition, yes, the contingent liability or contingent payment is higher now as a result of both volumes and the fact that there's a shorter discount period related to the fair value as you move through time to get closer to the end of the second earn-out payment as well.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes and then on the frac side of things, we're seeing a large increase in Y-grade volumes from our systems and that's happening for others other systems to grow. So, fractionation capacity is indeed very tight at Mont Belvieu right now.
Shneur Gershuni: Great. Thank you very much guys. Appreciate the color.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks Shneur.
Matt Meloy: Hey thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Christine Cho of Barclays. Your line is open.
Christine Cho: Hi everyone.
Jennifer Kneale: Good morning.
Christine Cho: The gas pipes out of the Permian quite approaching full capacity. An incremental takeaway isn't expected till second half of next year. Do you have an idea of what the producers behind your system are going to do? Should we think that this could potentially slow down growth or is the plan to start flaring?
Joe Bob Perkins: Question was sort of broad generalization. I believe that it could result in increased -- in the Permian. That's a natural conclusion to come to. But it's going to depend on each producer situation and locally where are you in the Permian relative to those takeaway. Also, we've done everything we can to try to provide for our producers driving with our hiding zone is the way we like to think about it, to both get them to liquid points and to get them out of the basin. Targa is attempting to do that for the near and medium term and just as many of our competitors are. But I like where we've positioned ourselves so far as a function of our large aggregated residue position in the basin.
Christine Cho: And as a follow-up, like just -- excuse me for my ignorance, but I'm under the impression that this flaring usually occurs at the wellhead. So, curious as to why this doesn't happen at the back end of the processing plant with just the residue gas?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes. Now, we're talking about emissions regulatory frameworks. Targa as a midstream operator is going to live within our relatively requirements just as the E&P customers wherever are trying live within their regulatory requirements. There are different regulatory requirements at the wellhead than at centralized processing plant. And broadly speaking, producers can get temporary waivers on the ability to flare at the wellhead and Targa will continue to comply with the emissions requirements that we're under and centralized gathering processing facilities.
Christine Cho: I see. Okay. That's very helpful. And then you guys have seen some big growth numbers in South Texas. On the NGL volumes that it's turning out, implies that the gas is much richer than what you've historically seen in that segment. Can you talk about what's driving that? Is that just as simple as Flag City volumes are much richer? And how should we think about the cadence of that growth going forward?
Matt Meloy: Yes. For the Y-grade increase we've seen, if we look at the year-over-year volumes, a lot of that is more of recovery. And so as we look at just our economics and producers' economics, you can see the -- recovery. So, I think it's really more just a factor of what we are recovering at the plants more than the gas being richer.
Christine Cho: I see. Okay. And then just two housekeeping items. Did you say that some of the volumes in the Permian were being overflowed to third-party plants? And if that was what I heard, could you quantify how much and for how long?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, we gave a number in the fourth quarter about the offloads we had to third-parties. It was -- what had been?
Matt Meloy: About 30.
Joe Bob Perkins: It was 30 million or so. We had some in the first quarter. We didn't quantify. It's significantly less than that. So, most of it we're able to get onto our systems. And you look at the average for the quarter with Joyce coming on, it did provide some relief. But we didn't quantify for the first quarter what that was, but it was 30 in the fourth quarter.
Christine Cho: Thank you so much.
Matt Meloy: Thank you Christine.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Colton Bean of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is open.
Matt Meloy: Good morning Colton.
Colton Bean: Good morning. I just wanted to check on the Delaware processing throughput. Looks like volumes were effectively flat quarter-over-quarter. So, is that somewhat constrained to Oahu came into service or is it primarily the result of weather impacts?
Matt Meloy: Yes. So, I think that was potentially -- or it was partially related to the weather impacts. We were in a process of starting up Oahu as well. But we see the outlook really as strong as ever for the Delaware. And you can kind of see that with actually the payment that Jen mentioned increasing for next year, the earn-out payments. So, I think the outlook is as good if not better, but it was impacted by weather in the first quarter.
Colton Bean: And I guess, just a follow-up on that from an operational standpoint, is there a risk to seasonality production as you have more production coming from the Delaware with the significantly higher water cut?
Joe Bob Perkins: That's an interesting observation. The higher water cut is problematic. The multisystem -- systems connect at the multisystem helps us as a midstream provider and we will be learning what it means for each of our E&P producers. What typically happens is they get better and better at handling this and we would expect that.
Colton Bean: Okay. And just to switch gears over to crude gathering. Looks like the updated presentation shows a pretty steep uptick for gathering in April versus Q1. You guys have any comments on what the driver of that was, whether it be Permian or Badlands, and just kind of some comments there?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes. A significant uptick of that was in the -- up in the Badlands. We mentioned -- I think we said in the script 140,000 barrels a day. So, it was a pretty good uptick up in the Badlands. I think we saw some growth in the Permian as well, more on the Midland side.
Colton Bean: Got it. And then just final one from me probably on the fractionation front. Appreciate that the fourth quarter saw an uplift from volume shifting from Q3. I think you had previously provided an adjusted number for Q4, and it looks like that was revised a bit further. So, if you guys could just talk about kind of what the -- that secondary revision was and how we should think about the trajectory over the course of the year.
Jennifer Kneale: Yes. So, when we are looking at the numbers, Colton, part of what we revised was the fact that we also had a number of third-party volumes running through our fracs in the fourth quarter related to those third-parties also having built inventory as a result of Hurricane Harvey. So, we felt like that was a more accurate depiction of the Hurricane Harvey impact was to not just show the impact to Targa of inventory that moved into the fourth quarter, but also to quantify for you the impact of third-party inventory that also moved into the fourth quarter.
Colton Bean: That makes sense. All right. Appreciate the time.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from TJ Schultz with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
TJ Schultz: Hey good morning.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hey good morning.
TJ Schultz: Hey. How far along in the process are you on the term loan and splitter asset sale program? Have this been received at this point?
Matt Meloy: Yes. I guess I would just say that, that process is progressing. There is a lot of interest, so there's a lot of potential bidders that were -- have signed CAs. So, that's as far I'll kind of say as part as the process. But early indications are that the progress is progressing very well, and there's a lot of interest.
TJ Schultz: Okay. Thanks. The Galena Park dock rebuild, can you quantify what impact that will have on operational capacity for exports?
Joe Bob Perkins: Let me provide a quick answer to that one. I noticed as we went through the script, that might have left a question. We were trying to point to our customers and others that the impact to the work would not be significant while it was going on. What we were trying to point to was that, it was not debottlenecking or making things better. So, I just thought I'd clarify what the intention of the script, and Scott can add some more color to it. 
Scott Pryor: Yes. Certainly, what we point to is the fact that we will have some downtime associated with that Dock 2 rebuild during the second and third quarter. But again, from a contractual standpoint, our obligation to our customers, and frankly, the ability to continue to spot sell where there is availability in the marketplace will continue throughout those quarters. So, we -- again, we see very minimal impact to us.
Joe Bob Perkins: And we haven't quantified what positive it's providing. We're constantly working on adding effective capacity.
TJ Schultz: Okay. Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Thanks TJ.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.
Matt Meloy: Good morning Craig.
Craig Shere: Good morning.
Matt Meloy: Hey good morning.
Craig Shere: Appreciate the continued robust outlook for the LPG market with exports. We're starting to hear more and more peers kind of talk about vertically integrating into that same area. Can you kind of opine on the potential enhanced competition that might develop and your competitive edge over the next two, three years?
Scott Pryor: This is Scott, Craig. What I would say is, is, again, when we look at the position that we have, again, integrated through our upstream production, now tied into pipelines that are connecting upstream to downstream through Grand Prix and the increased capacity that we will have over time through fractionation, the announcement of our Train 6, which is currently under construction, looking at additional permits in the future for fractionation expansion, all tied to our Galena Park facilities, we like our position, especially when you look at the ability to store it in Mont Belvieu. So, I can't really concentrate or comment on what's going on with competition. I would just say that our integrated platform looks very attractive to the marketplace, and our customer service is very good as well. So, we like our potential for growth in the future. And we have the ability to expand at our own facility. And we constantly look at opportunities to do those things and we're in a position that we like.
Craig Shere: Are you looking at all at diversifying the product in future years?
Scott Pryor: Certainly most of our concentration over the years since our first announced expansion back in 2013 has been more on propane over the years. And the recent announcement with Dock 2 and some of the integration with the new pipeline concentrates a little bit more on butanes, where we see some growth opportunities. So, we're enhancing those capabilities. We're always going to look at other products. We've mentioned in the past the possibilities of increasing our abilities on ethylene. But again, currently today, our concentration is on propane and butanes, but we don't write-off any other potential products.
Craig Shere: That's helpful. Thank you. And last question. Joe Bob, in your prepared remarks, you kind of foreshadowed additional Permian acreage dedications expected in coming months. Without specifics, any kind of proportionality or book-end range you can provide for some of this incremental commercial opportunity?
Joe Bob Perkins: I'm very pleased with the traction we have on commercial activity around our assets. And in those prepared remarks and sometimes I go off script, I was trying to point to the benefits that the high pressure header associated with that very large investment-grade energy company's dedication, that pipe running through that part of the Delaware would provide. And they're incremental to the first deal, but very attractive because they are incremental to the first deal and then leverage that pipe that's being put in place. Others, we don't talk about. The leveraging of existing assets, the leveraging of our footprint is very accretive, higher return than if we were out there working in the whitespace. That's our focus, and I'm proud of the team that's doing that.
Craig Shere: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Darren Horowitz with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Darren Horowitz: On the logistics side, you had mentioned higher ethane recoveries and the opportunity for that to lead to higher frac volumes. From an ethane recovery perspective, what level is built into your guidance? And what pricing impact as we progress throughout this year do you think that's going to have on ethane fracs, spreads, specifically net to your equity and your interest?
Matt Meloy: Yes. Good question, Dan. So, we had -- when we had that outlook, we had a significant amount of ethane recovery built into that longer range forecast. So, -- and it's a mix. Some of our plans for -- are in full a recovery, others are in partial rejection. And some -- oftentimes, if we have capacity constraints in areas, we'll go into rejection even if it's -- could be operational issues that lead to that. So, it's a mix in that forecast. There is some upside if we were going to go into full recovery mode. There would be some upside to that forecast, and it's really going to benefit us. One, on the frac side as we get more volumes through the fractionation. But once Grand Prix comes online, we'll get the kind of double benefit of getting additional fees for transportation and fractionation. So, it's really kind of as you go into those later years when Grand Prix is online, there's more upside, I'd say, in the post-Grand Prix commencement than the pre.
Darren Horowitz: Okay. And then, if I could, just one quick financing question. Jen, as you think about derisking the funding gap, excluding any sort of petroleum logistics asset sale, for the remaining 2018 equity requirement, do you think -- or I should -- maybe I should say, hypothetically, do you forecast that the ATM on a standalone basis can get you there? And then when you think about the upcoming construct for financing 2019 growth CapEx, including the outrigger earn-out payment and how you guys are thinking about the call option on the DevCo asset JVs, what's the propensity to take on additional debt? And up to what level from a coverage or ratio perspective are you comfortable? Because obviously, what you did in April is an extremely attractive cost to capital. So, can you just give us some color there?
Jennifer Kneale: Sure. I think from our perspective, obviously the ATM is a very useful tool. It's been a bit of a game changer as a C Corp. versus an MLP, just in terms of the daily liquidity that we have. So, certainly, if we wanted to just fund through the ATM over the course of the year, that's a tool that's available to us. I think you very consistently heard us say that we are going to use a multifaceted approach to our funding for 2018 and 2019. You've seen us execute in a number of different ways already in terms of the DevCos, the more asset level or strategic joint ventures, obviously the barge sale, and we do have the pet log's evaluation of a potential sale ongoing. So, I think it will continue to be a multifaceted approach looking forward. We're very focused on being prudent and thoughtful given the visibility that we have to our long-term EBITDA outlook and figuring out the way that we can most effectively and efficiently fund our capital program, and that will continue to be our focus. That's very much unchanged.
Joe Bob Perkins: Colton that was a very good question and a very good answer from Jen.
Jennifer Kneale: Darren.
Joe Bob Perkins: Down -- I'm sorry, Darren. Down in the beginning of the question, there was if you exclude the petroleum logistic sale. We were thinking that, that was the most likely scenario. We wouldn't have gone through the trouble of the process in the first place. So, there is likely to be some proceeds. Some of those assets are very likely to sell. That would have to be the expected case or we would -- we've got better things to do.
Jennifer Kneale: And then related to the DevCos, I mean, we very thoughtfully tried to put a structure together that gave us a lot of flexibility, and that's why we have a four-year option period to buy the interest back. That's why we can buy the interest back in part or in whole. And I think sort of more consistent with Targa past practice would be to assume that we won't wait till the very end to take it out and we won't take it out all at once. We'll be very thoughtful and prudent about how we approach that as well.
Darren Horowitz: Thank you.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks Darren.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Vikram Bagri with Citi. Your line is open.
Matt Meloy: Hey good morning.
Vikram Bagri: Hey guys. Quickly wanted to follow up on an earlier question. The 25% inlet volume growth guidance that you have for Permian Basin, does that factor natural gas takeaway constraints in any way? And you've mentioned you're taking steps to mitigate the impact of takeaway constraints on your customers. Anything you can share in terms of steps you've taken or things you can do to mitigate the impact?
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure. So, when we gave the 25% Permian growth, that's the bottoms-up build from our producers. And it was our expectation at those levels that we'd be able to get the gas moved to market and away from market. We are one of the larger gas movers in the basin. We're constantly working on securing rights and access to various pipes and we think we've done a good job at serving our producers' needs. It may get tight. As Joe Bob mentioned, there could be some potential flaring. We'll just have to see how the growth progresses and where the pinpoints are. But we've done a proactive job at securing additional takeaway and capacity at the various points in and around the Permian.
Vikram Bagri: Okay. Understood. And in terms of Midland Basin GPM, it picked up in 1Q, was that due to ethane recovery? Or was there something else going on which was one-time?
Matt Meloy: It was essentially more ethane recovery in Q1.
Vikram Bagri: Okay. And the final question I had about the Permian Basin was I want to get clarity around your contract with this IG-rated company that signed up for G&P and downstream services. Is the contract for incremental production above current levels? Or some of the existing volumes could also be shifted to TRGP systems in the future? Anything you can share on that front.
Matt Meloy: Yes. I want to be careful getting into too much about any specific contract with any one producer. I think I'll just say we have a very attractive long-term contract with this producer for significant volumes and that we expect will be falling down our system, and we've announced capital associated with those expected volumes. So, we feel very good that those volumes are going to be, in fact, available for us.
Vikram Bagri: Understood. Thank you very much. That's all I had.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jeremy Tonet: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. In the slides, you noted under LPG exports strong first quarter exports from additional short-term opportunities there. I was just wondering if you might be able to expand a little bit on what the dynamics were there and if that lease due in an environment where you can kind of extend your contract profile?
Joe Bob Perkins: We're constantly, Jeremy, looking at extending our contract portfolio. We talked about a diversified portfolio on just about every call that we've had for earnings. The success that we saw in the first quarter resulted in demand that we've seen both in the Americas, Europe, and other areas that we ship to or that we provide products to. We would expect that some of that could continue forward. I'm not going to lean into whether or not that has led to other long-term contracts or anything like that, but we also did give you an indication in the script today that the volumes that we saw in April were very similar to what we saw in the first quarter.
Jeremy Tonet: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just as far as the freeze-offs, I'm wondering if you might be able to quantify the dollar impact there. I think you gave the volumes. But just wondering if you had that -- if you could share that.
Matt Meloy: No, I think you just have to kind of use your model and estimate for another 2% kind of growth in the Permian, what that would relate to in out-margin.
Jeremy Tonet: Fair enough. I'll stop there. Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thanks Jeremy.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks Jeremy.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.
Sunil Sibal: Yes, hi good morning guys and thanks for all the colors on the call. Just had one clarification. So, out of the $2.2 billion net growth CapEx for 2018, how much was spent so far in Q1? And then how should we think about the cadence for the remainder of the year?
Jennifer Kneale: I think it was around $400 million to $500 million for the first quarter, Sunil. And then as you think about cadence through the year that would indicate that potentially be fairly ratable.
Matt Meloy: Yes. And we'll be filing the Q, which will have the breakout for total CapEx, maintenance growth, and then it will have growth in that in there as well.
Sunil Sibal: Okay, got it. That's all I had. Thanks guys.
Sunil Sibal: Yes, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Dennis Coleman with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Dennis Coleman: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Just a quick fact-check for me. I'm sorry. I was scribbling quickly. But can you just review the expansion capability for Grand Prix. There was a bunch of numbers, I think $300 million to $550 million.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Sure. I'm going to go pull up my notes.
Joe Bob Perkins: He's pulling it up. The short one is you can see those expansion capabilities described on a page in our investor presentation and it's consistent with initial announcement where it had the un-pumped capacity and then the pumped-up capacity for the Western leg and for the Southern leg. And those were the capacities that he did. And then we said for that, across the $1.3 billion worth of initial announced capital, that only less than a 10% increase was required to fully pump up those two segments to the pipe. But you can give him the numbers.
Dennis Coleman: Yes. Okay, perfect.
Matt Meloy: The numbers are in slide 15. 
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you. Slide 15 with the current deck.
Dennis Coleman: That's fine. The 10% was what I wanted to get back to, to the numbers, and I'll check it on the slide. So okay. Thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: I can only remember some of them, but I can't remember most of them.
Dennis Coleman: You got through them quickly.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Sanjay Lad for closing remarks.
Sanjay Lad: Great. Thanks to everyone that was on the call this morning and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. Jen and I will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thanks and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you all may disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Joe Bob Perkins, Targa's Chief Executive Officer.
Joe Bob Perkins: That Mr. Joe Bob Perkins was not in the script. Thanks, Sanjay. Good morning. Thank you to everyone for joining. At the beginning of this month, you probably noticed that we announced some executive promotions, reflecting the significant leadership capabilities within the company and the increasing leadership roles that these individuals have continued to take on at Targa. Although their official new title date is March 1, they're really acting in those roles today and on this call. Today I'm going to begin the call with a strategic update. I'll then turn it over to Matt Meloy, our new President. He will give an update on commercial developments and business fundamentals and then Jen Kneale, our new CFO will discuss fourth quarter 2017 results and present our financial and operational expectations for 2018. Were also joined in the room by Pat McDonie, newly promoted President of our Gathering and Processing Segment, Scott Pryor, promoted to President of our Logistics and Marketing Segment and Robert Muraro, our new Chief Commercial Officer and Robert wants you to call him Bobby. We will collectively handle Q&A. The investor and industry feedback since the announcement of the promotions has been very positive. We have a very talented team, these individuals and their teams working very well together. 2017 was one of our busiest years at Targa in what will potentially be viewed as another transformational year for the company. Over the course of 2017, we added approximately 325 million cubic feet per day of incremental natural gas processing capacity. Approved and began construction on another 710 million cubic feet per day of incremental processing capacity additions. Acquired under an earnout structure and quickly integrated additional Delaware and Midland basin midstream assets. Commercialized and started construction on our 300,000 barrel per day Grand Prix NGL pipeline, entered into a strategic joint venture with Blackstone for Grand Prix, secured a long-term NGL dedication and commitment from EagleClaw and also continued to secure incremental third-party commitments to transport volumes on Grand Prix. We acquired the Flag City assets and related commercial contracts from Boardwalk Pipeline Partners in South Texas, executed definitive agreements with Kinder Morgan and DCP Midstream to jointly develop the Gulf Coast express pipeline, raised $1.6 billion of equity and $750 million of debt over the course of the year and Targa ensured the continued safe operations of our facilities for our customers and for our shareholders with heroic individual efforts by some of our employees to mitigate the impact of the tropical storms we experienced on the Gulf Coast this fall. 2017 was a busy and impactful year. Now we're only 1.5 months into 2018 and we have already announced the formation of a 50-50 joint venture with Hess Midstream to construct a new 200 million cubic feet per day processing plant in the Bakken, enhanced our Centrahoma Joint Venture with MPLX in Oklahoma and are adding processing capacity with the Flag City plant relocated from South Texas to Oklahoma. Announced construction of two new 250 million cubic feet per day processing plants in the Midland Basin, announced a new 100,000 barrel per day fractionator connected to our Mont Belvieu complex, created and announced an innovative development company joint ventures or so-called DevCos that provided $190 million of capital reimbursement at closing and total potential capital savings of up to about $960 million and we've continued executing on the 2017 and 2018 projects announced to date. So far 2018 activity has been on a similar pace to 2017 and I don't see any signs of it slowing down. Our activity levels and execution in 2017 and year-to-date 2018 support our key strategic initiatives including, number one, to invest in our businesses, investing in attractive projects that leverage our existing infrastructure and further strengthen our competitive advantage. Number two, to proactively finance our growth program underway and to maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility and number three, to continue to identify additional opportunities to further integrate strengthening our asset base to further enhance an attractive long-term outlook. And from where we sit today, the long-term outlook for Targa is better than ever, better than ever because of excellent execution and because opportunities that we are seeing around our gathering and processing and our downstream assets are robust. Our focus remains on execution and continuing to provide best-in-class midstream service to our customers. For Targa, 2018 will look a lot like 2017 in many ways, as we expect to spend at least another $1.6 billion of net growth CapEx on investment opportunities and we are still a year or more away from some of our key projects like Grand Prix coming online and contributing to EBITDA. Our current investment cycle positions us for significant visible EBITDA growth in 2019 and beyond, which is why this is a very exciting time at Targa. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt and Matt will provide an update around the execution of our strategic parties and an update on our business fundamentals, Matt?
Matt Meloy: Thanks Joe Bob and good morning, everyone. Commercial activity and production and many of our operating regions continues to increase and we expect this positive trend to continue through 2018 and beyond. Overall, 2017 Inlet volumes in the Permian increased 19% over the previous year. Our fourth quarter Permian Inlet volume increased in average of 300 million cubic feet per day over the fourth quarter of 2016 and would've been even higher, but we temporarily offloaded an average of about 30 million cubic feet per day to third-party processors in the fourth quarter, given system capacity constraints that will be improved when the Joyce plant comes online. Inlet volumes for 2017 total field gathering and processing increased 7% over 2016 average and this growth was slightly less than our guidance as a result steeper volume declines in North Texas and West Oak and the fourth quarter Permian offloads. Back to the Permian, we continue to execute on our growth program and remain on track to add incremental 710 million cubic feet per day of new processing capacity in 2018. In the Delaware we expect to begin operations on our 60 million cubic feet per day at Wahoo plant later this month and construction continues on our 250 million cubic feet per day Wildcat plant, which is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2018. These plants are interconnected with multiple other plants and systems across the Delaware and Central Basin. In Permian Midland, production growth continues at a rapid pace. We are currently running some of our West Texas facilities above nameplate capacity to meet the processing needs of our customers and have been offloading to other third-party midstream providers. Our 200 million cubic feet per day Joyce plant is expected to be operational in late March and while providing some much-needed system relief, we expect the Joyce plant essentially will be full from the first day of operations. Our expectations for our 200 million cubic feet per day Johnson plant are similar and is anticipated to begin service in the third quarter and is also expected to be highly utilized when it comes online. We announced publicly a couple of weeks ago that as a result of the production trend that we're experiencing and continued production growth forecast from our customers, we are moving forward with construction of two new 250 million cubic feet per day Cryo plant in the Permian Midland. The first plant will begin operations in the first quarter of 2019 and the second plant in the third quarter of 2019. Similar to our other plants currently under construction, these plants will be interconnected with multiple other plants and systems. Based on all the Midland basin trends and forecasts that we are seeing from our producers and from the broader industry, we expect to add future processing capacity beyond these announced plants. The volumes from our newly announced Targa plants will be transported on Grand Prix to our fractionation assets and LPG export facility in Mont Belvieu, which means substantial organic growth across Targa's integrated footprint. Moving to our Oklahoma assets, our Outlook is generally improving as we benefit from continued commercial success, the expansion of our Centrahoma JV with MPLX, includes the addition of another 150 million cubic feet per day of capacity with our relocated Flag City plant becoming the Hickory Hill plant, which will support growing natural gas production from the Arkoma Woodford Basin. The Hickory Hills plant is expected to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2018. Similarly in the Bakken, our outlook continues to strengthen as activity continues on a dedicated acreage and as we benefit from volumes from our producers pad drilling. Given our forecast for production growth on our dedicated acreage and other activity in the area, we are very pleased to enter into a 50-50 JV with Hess Midstream to construct a 200 million cubic feet per day plant at our existing little Missouri facility to help meet our and Hess' growing processing needs. We have also executed an NGL Takeaway, sorry, we have also executed an agreement for NGL Takeaway with One Oak. That agreement will also allow us to direct growing volumes from our Bakken assets to our fractionation footprint in Mont Belvieu. This is another example of our continuing focus to integrate our G&P volumes through our downstream asset. Continuing more broadly in our downstream business, the long-term outlook for our logistics and marketing continues to strengthen as we are well positioned to benefit from strong supply and demand fundamentals. First higher field G&P Inlet volume are driving higher fractionation volumes and we expect this trend to continue in 2018 and beyond. Adjusting fourth quarter volumes for the shift related to the impact from hurricane Harvey, we saw an average increase of 115,000 barrels per day of Y-grade volumes available for fractionation when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, we're also seeing a trend of more ethane recovery in the Permian and midcontinent regions, which is driving higher fractionation volumes. New Gulf Coast petrochemical demand supports a positive ethane frac spread, which may result in higher fractionation volumes for Targa over time. The U.S. had approximately 150,000 barrels per day of new petrochemical industry ethane demand commenced operations in late '17. We expect an incremental 300,000 barrels per day by the end of '18 and additional growth in 2019 and beyond with the vast majority of the expansions and new builds located along the Gulf coast. Likely as a result of the factors just mentioned, we are currently seeing some tightness in the fractionation market in Mont Belvieu with demand for long-term contracts increasing. We also continued to add third-party contracts for both transportation and fractionation services. As a result, we are moving forward with construction of an additional fractionation train in Mont Belvieu. The fractionation tower and pipeline into and out of the tower will be owned 100% by the fractionation DevCos with an estimated cost of approximately $270 million and Targa will fund 20% under the DevCo structure. Then Targa will fund 100% of the cost or approximately $80 million associated with the other infrastructure required for the additional fractionation train that is interwoven across our Mont Belvieu footprint. We also recently submitted permitting for additional fractionation in Mont Belvieu to proactively prepare for expected future NGL volume growth. Shifting to our LPG export business, our long-term outlook is largely unchanged. We have an attractive multiyear contract position, higher propane prices in the U.S. in the fourth quarter and early 2018 have not slowed. The amount of propane and butanes leaving the dock in interest and multiyear contracts continues and the long-term fundamentals remain robust for U.S. LPG exporters, driven by international LPG demand growth and continued strength in growing LPG supply from the U.S. We currently have the most flexible export facility on the Gulf Coast with the ability to load multiple products in vessel sizes and we continue to work to further enhance our capabilities and flexibility to meet customer demand. Ongoing enhancements include rebuilding and upgrading our oldest dock and adding infrastructure at Mont Belvieu and Galena Park, including a new pipeline between Mont Belvieu and Galena Park to improve load rate efficiency, especially related to the export of butanes. These enhancements give us additional capability to export more LPG volumes depending upon vessel size and product mix. These enhancements have been staged for minimal impact to Targa's operational capacity at Galena Park during the dock rebuild, which is concentrated during the second and third quarters this year and no impacts on our ability to meet our contractual obligations. The capital cost associated with these improvements is already included in our $1.6 billion of net growth CapEx and we expect that these projects will be fully completed during the second quarter of 2019. Moving on to our Grand Prix pipeline, this asset is a game changer for Targa over the long-term as it provides significant and increasing fee-based earnings, reduces our reliance an obligation to third-party pipelines and helps direct incremental volumes to Targa's downstream facilities. Our outlook for Grand Prix continues to strengthen as a result of our commercial success, securing incremental third-party volumes from both transportation and fractionation and increasing GMP volume outlook driving additional plants across our footprint. Construction of Grand Prix continues and we expect the pipeline to be fully operational in the second quarter of 2019. At our Channelview terminal, we expect our 35,000 barrel per day crude and condensate splitter to be completed in the second quarter of 2018. As many of you are aware, our splitter is underpinned by a long-time fee-based contract with Vitol after they completed their acquisition of Noble Americas in January and we look forward to a continued relationship with Vitol. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jen to discuss Targa's results for the fourth quarter and our operational and financial expectations for 2018.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $328 million which was 10% higher than the same period in 2016. Continued strong volume growth in Permian GMP complement by higher volumes in Badlands, SouthTX and SouthOK along with higher commodity prices and higher fractionation volumes drove the increase in adjusted EBITDA over the prior year, offset by declining WestOK and North Texas volumes. Reported net maintenance CapEx was $27 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $28 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and total net maintenance CapEx for full year 2017 was $99 million. Distributable cash flow for the fourth quarter was $275 million resulting in dividend coverage of 1.24 times consistent with our expectation that dividend coverage would be highest in the fourth quarter. For full year 2017, adjusted EBITDA of $1.14 billion increased 7% over 2016 and exceeded our previously communicated full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.13 billion. Full-year dividend coverage was approximately one times as anticipated. Moving to our sequential results, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter increased 19% over the third quarter and our Gathering and Processing segment operating margin increased by $36 million in the fourth quarter when compared to the third quarter, primarily due to higher NGL prices and higher Inlet volumes in the Permian, Badlands, SouthTX and SouthOK. Fourth quarter Permian Inlet volumes sequentially increased to 4% from growth in each of our Permian Midland and Permian Delaware systems and as Matt mentioned, volumes would've been higher pro forma for offloaded volumes. Inlet volumes in SouthTX sequentially increased 11% as we benefited from higher volumes from Sanchez through the Raptor plant. In the Bakken, Badlands crude oil gathered volumes were approximately 120,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter, increasing 10% over the third quarter and fourth quarter natural gas volumes increased by approximately 9% over the third quarter. Volumes also sequentially increased in SouthOK as incremental scoop volumes offset legacy production declines. Permian crude volumes gathered in the fourth quarter were approximately 45,000 barrels per day. In our logistics and marketing segment, operating margin increased $38 million in the fourth quarter when compared to the third quarter. As estimated approximately $7 million of operating margin in our downstream segment shifted into the fourth quarter as a result of temporary operational disruptions related to the impacts of hurricane Harvey. strong volume growth in Permian G&P predominantly drove fourth quarter fractionation volumes to average 443,000 barrels per day including 29,000 barrels per day that shifted into the fourth quarter as a result of the impact of hurricane Harvey. LPG export volumes were also strong in the fourth quarter as we averaged 6.4 million barrels per month of exports at Galena Park including about 380,000 barrels per month that were attributable to cargos that were deferred into the fourth quarter, again as a result of the impact of hurricane Harvey Overall, operating expenses during the fourth quarter in both our G&P and downstream segments were essentially flat to the third quarter, despite increasing volumes. Full year 2017 average fractionation volumes increased 15% over average 2016 and average 2017 LPG export volumes of 5.6 million barrels per month were roughly in line with average 2016. Moving now to other finance-related matters, the reported aggregate fair value of the earnout payments for our Permian acquisition are currently estimated to be about $317 million with a $7 million payment forecasted for April 2018 and $310 million estimated to be paid in April 2019. During the fourth quarter, we executed additional hedges as we benefited from forward price strength in certain commodities. For 2018, we estimate that we've hedged approximately 85% of natural gas, 75% of NGLs and 75% of condensate volumes based on our estimated current equity volumes from Field G&P. Our natural gas hedges include regional hedges. For 2019, we estimate that we've hedged approximately 65% of natural gas, 40% of condensate and 35% of NGL volumes, again based on our estimate of current equity volumes from field gathering and processing. Our consolidated liquidity as of year-end was approximately $1.9 billion including approximately $137 million in cash. On a debt compliance basis, TRP's leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 3.8 times versus a compliance covenant of 5.5 times. Our consolidated reported debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 4.4 times. Since year-end we improved our financial position further through execution of the DevCo JVs, which increased our current liquidity to $2.1 billion given a $190 million of proceeds received from Stonepeak. The DevCo JVs demonstrate our access to private capital at an attractive cost and they significantly reduce our equity funding needs for 2018 and also for 2019 while preserving our balance sheet strength and flexibility. Some of the other benefits of the DevCo JVs structure include, no deletion to Targa's existing shareholders and no reduction in dividend coverage during the construction period, the flexibility to acquire Stonepeak's interest over four years beginning at the earlier of the commercial operations stage of the final project currently estimated to be GCX in October 2019 or January 01, 2020. The flexibility to acquire the first 50% of Stonepeak's interest in minimum increments of $100 million and then acquire the remaining 50% in one purchase. We maintained Targa control, the management, construction and operations of Grand Prix and the additional fractionation train and finally we retained the residual upside of the contributed projects for Targa's shareholders, given the purchase option and to be clear, our base case assumptions are that we will acquire Stonepeak's interest. Let's now turn our expectations for 2018, which assume NGL composite barrel prices to average $0.67 per gallon, crude oil prices to average $58 per barrel and natural gas prices to average $2.75 per MMBtu for the year. Beginning with our GMP segment, we expect total Permian natural gas Inlet volumes for 2018 to average between 1.55 to 1.65 billion cubic feet per day with the midpoint of the range representing a 25% increase in average 2018 Permian Inlet volumes over the 2017 average. We expect Permian Inlet volumes to sequentially ramp with average fourth quarter 2018 Inlet volumes being the highest quarter of the year. We also expect to average 2018 Inlet volume in SouthOK, SouthTX and the Badlands to be higher than average 2017. Collectively, we expect total Field G&P natural gas Inlet volumes for 2018 to average between 3.15 to 3.35 billion cubic feet per day with the midpoint of the range representing an 18% increase in average total Field G&P Inlet volumes over the 2017 average. We also expect total crude gathered volumes in both the Badlands and the Permian to be higher on average in 2018 than averaged 2017. Downstream, we expect fractionation volumes to significantly increase year-over-year, largely driven by growth in Permian G&P volumes. While ultimately, we expect the increase in -- while ultimately, we expect the increase in Permian volumes for Targa and others will be constructed for additional LPG exports, our financial expectations for 2018 only include currently contracted volumes. We expect more than contracted volumes, but our overall guidance again only includes those that are contracted. We expect full year 2018 adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.225 billion to $1.325 billion with the midpoint of the range representing a 12% increase over 2017 adjusted EBITDA. Similar to 2017, we expect full year 2018 dividend coverage to be about one time, assuming a flat $3.64 annual dividend. We expect 2018 quarterly adjusted EBIDTA to increase sequentially with fourth quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA and fourth quarter dividend coverage being the highest for the year. First quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected to be the lowest. As our volumes are expected to ramp throughout 2018 and because were impacted by freeze-offs in January. As announced recently and proforma for the DevCo JVs, our current 2018 net growth CapEx estimate is approximately $1.6 billion. And it is reasonable to assume that 2018 CapEx will be higher than that as we move through the year and continue to execute commercially. Full year 2018 maintenance CapEx is forecasted to be approximately $120 million. Given the financing steps that we took in 2017 and the steps that we have already taken in 2018, we believe that our remaining financing needs for 2018 are very manageable. In 2017 we over-equities, when we announced the Permian acquisition and also when we announced Grand Prix and then later reduced our overall capital obligations to our Grand Prix strategic JV with BlackStone. Our recent execution of the DevCo JV will provide approximately $550 million of capital in 2018 and additional significant capital savings in 2019. We announced two strategic JVs in January, with Hess Midstream and MPLX that also resulted in targeted being reimbursed for capital ROE spend and reduced our funding obligations for the assets under construction going forward. We continue to evaluate and have opportunities for asset sales, additional asset and/or development joint ventures preferred equity and common equity. And we of course also consider other alternatives, including utilizing more leverage than a 50/50 debt equity capital funding model given our current balance sheet strength and visibility into increasing EBITDA in the future. And with that I will turn the call back over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks Jim. Thank you, Matt. I'm sure that the listeners can tell that there's a lot of enthusiasm of positive momentum for our target team right now. Enthusiasm and momentum as exemplified by our comments, demonstrated by recent commercial traction and financial creativity and supported by strong business fundamentals and the strong volume trends in both our gathering and processing and downstream segments. The capital program that we have underway is expected to generate significant cash flow growth when the assets are operational and we expect to continue to fund our CapEx to maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility and to maximize long term shareholder returns. Our outlook will continue to strengthen, enhanced by stronger fundamentals in continued commercial and operational execution. The longer term outlook that we provided last June is better today for 2021, since providing that outlook we have announced additional commercial success and announced additional growth projects from our project backlog. And we are well positioned to continue to outperform that EBITDA growth outlook on multiple dimensions as we move through time. For example, any commercial execution is accretive to that forecast. We assumed no growth wedge over that timeframe. We assume no additional gathering and processing contract. We assume no additional LPG export contracts. And we assume less growth projects than we have in progress today.  In closing our team at Targa remains focused on continuing to execute on our long term strategic objectives and we are very excited about Targa’s strong long term outlook. So, with that operator please open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instruction]. And our first question comes from Colton Bean of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open.
Colton Bean: Good morning. So just wanted to start it off on the LPG export side of things. So, you mentioned a bit of the dock enhancement work and apologize if I miss this, but did you guys quantify what impacts that may have to nameplate capacity?
Matt Meloy: Yeah, we did. Hi this is Matt here. I'll take a stab at this and then -- we did talk quite a bit about whether we should be increasing the nameplate or effective capacity. In our previous press release or presentations, we showed nameplate capacity effectively 9 million barrels, but that our effective operational capacity with 7 million barrels a month. What this project is going to do is it's going to add flexibility for us to load butane at a faster rate. So, it really depends on the product demand from the customers, whether it's more propane or butane and then refurbishing the dock, really redoing the dock and upgrading the dock will allow us to have more flexibility on what ships we can load out of there. So, it really depends on the vessel size demand and the demand for the product. So, we think we could likely do more than the 7 million barrels, so maybe it's a 7 million barrels plus, but we aren’t going to try and quantify exactly what that could be because it is so dependent on customer demand.
Scott Pryor: Yeah. The only thing I would add, I'm sorry go ahead.
Joe Bob Perkins: Colin, it's Scott Pryor trying to add on to the answers. So, we won’t cut you off. Go ahead Scott.
Scott Pryor: What I was going to add to that is obviously our customers have grown to expect a high service level from us and this is a way for us to continue that level of service and flexibility at our dock. The enhancements to that particular dock as Matt mentioned in his prepared remarks, it is one of our older docks and coming back and repairing it, doing some things to upgrade, loading arms improves the efficiency of that. And then the items that we've chosen to upgrade our Bellevue facility to debottleneck our ability to do butanes quicker will help us and provide efficiencies at the dock as well. The other thing, I would remind you of is that, when we look out into the forecast and obviously the growing market that we got behind our gas processing plants and then the global demand that's out there, much of that global demand is both a complement of propane and butane. So, this will provide us opportunities again to be more flexible and more serviceable to our customers.
Colton Bean: That's helpful. And I guess to follow through on that, given the growth that you guys see on the NGL production front, is there kind of a rough parameters that you would need to see to ultimately expand dock capacity. They are closer to that 9 or even beyond that? Whether it be in terms of loading rates or volume commitments, just any sort of parameters that you guys might need to see to take a more dramatic expansion project on?
Scott Pryor: I think the way we're thinking about it is, we're doing some of these enhancements at the dock and out in the pipeline to position us for that future growth. So, I think we're already working on some of those -- on some of those things because the fundamentals are so strong. We've also included the amount of capital for that project within our $1.6 billion net CapEx number that we gave you. So, this work was kind of already going on. We're always looking for ways to improve our dock efficiency and be able to improve the capacity of our facilities.
Colton Bean: Understood. And I guess just to continue on the NGL side of things, so this maybe a bit premature, but any sort of ballpark estimates on what capital needs may be if you guys were to choose to go ahead in that pump stations to Grand Prix to bring that up to full design capacity?
Joe Bob Perkins: We haven't described, this is Joe Bob. We haven't described the incremental required to go from nominally 300,000 barrels a day to 550,000 barrels a day or more. I think we have been quoted multiple times as saying, it's pretty marginal. Pumps don't cost very much. We already know where they need to be placed and it's rounding narrow frankly for your model.
Colton Bean: Okay. Got it. I think I'll leave it there. Appreciate the time.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Vikram Bagri of Citi. Your line is now open.
Vikram Bagri: Good morning, everyone and congratulations for the recent promotions.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you. Good morning.
Vikram Bagri: My first question is on the guidance you provided this morning. What are the drivers behind high and low end of the guidance? Is high end driven by higher dock utilization largely and how much of the upside is from G&P volumes, Permian are rising to the upside and so forth?
Jennifer Kneale: We think ultimately the guidance is really going to be driven by what we see from volumes really across our footprint. If you think about the growth that we're expecting to experience not only in the Permian, but also in some of other systems, so that's certainly part of it. Obviously, the high end of the low end could be impacted by commodity prices. It also could be impacted by just continued commercial execution particularly when we think about the LPG export business where we've essentially said that we're assuming that we do not move one additional cargo across the dock beyond what is contracted today. I'd certainly take the over on that. So, I think those are some of the factors that ultimately will impact where we where we shake out either in the range or above the range. But it's largely growth on the Permian and elsewhere in the field and how that's going to translate to frac downstream.
Vikram Bagri: And then a question on Mont Belvieu, I apologize I missed that. The frac volumes were much higher than we expected. How much of the total volumes reported were onetime volumes that were shifted from third quarter to fourth quarter?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yeah, we have that in the supplemental presentations in script at 29,000 barrels moved into Q4, essentially from Q3. 29000 barrels per day.
Vikram Bagri: And then just lastly on the Stonepeak transaction, we have much more clarity on Grand Prix pipeline than we did seven or eight months ago. So, the threshold for someone to participate in the project at this stage was I understand was high. I was wondering, how did you decide what assets to contribute and how much of the assets to contribute to the JV. Did you have a number in mind in terms of capital you wanted to raise from the transaction? And more predictable but lower return projects were contributed first and then remainder of the capital was raised by contributing Grand Prix pipeline?
Jennifer Kneale: No, I think that you know ultimately this was a structure that we put together and was really driven initially, I think it was driven by a number of different factors in terms of how we want to think about cost and some of the flexibility around what we were looking for in the structure. Basically, the structure serves as a bridge for us between -- for 2018 and 2019 while we're in this period of high capital spend before we're really benefiting from significantly ramping EBITDA. And so, when we looked across our platform of assets we were really trying to identify honestly assets that we saw would be most attractive to the capital providers that we have been talking to over the last many months to really structure something that was as cost efficient as possible. So, when you think about the projects that we dropped in there are relatively easy projects to sort of cordon off and be able to track the cash flows associated with them. And I think that's important and if you think about the fractionation, we basically have dropped the tower and the pipelines in and out of the tower into the down scale and we remove some of the noise that would have been created if we have dropped in some of the storage and other things that are very much interwoven with the rest of our footprint. So, we try to be very thoughtful around that. Obviously, these are fee-based assets attractive they're supported by take or pay. And so, that had a lot to do with it as well. So, there were a lot of different factors that sort of went into ultimately what assets got up.
Vikram Bagri: Thank you very much. That's all I have.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from Shneur Gershuni of UBS. Your line is now open.
Shneur Gershuni: Good morning everyone. Just wanted to start off I guess with Joe Bob your closing remarks you talked about kind of the five-year plan that you laid out and that there have been some incremental opportunities be it Gulf Coast Express so forth. When we sort of think about sensitizing the upside potential of that, are we talking something like north of 10% or 15% you know versus kind of how you were thinking about the end of the five-year plan or is it more in the sub 10% or 5% range?
Scott Pryor: Its -- Joe Bob is definitely taking this over on what we put out there in June and how much older is a function of how successful we continue to be on the project that we've already announced and the work that's going on that hasn't been announced. I feel really good about it. You should not be marginalizing those small percentage above that I was implying and I don't think we're going to stop working on making it even better. For a continuing outlook of the pricing that we put into that and the activity levels, without giving you a percentage I'm a lot more comfortable with something into significant and not something that's essentially insignificant.
Shneur Gershuni: Fair enough. Just a couple of quick follow ups. Strategically in 2020 when you roll down the debt co or you're able to buyback the assets strategically how do you approach it? Do you buy back the expected highest IRR projects first and leave to lower IRR projects to be acquired last? Just trying to understand is this strategy there. Jenny mentioned that you guys the planners obviously buy everything or does it just all happen at once, just kind of on and on occasion some thought process strategically for that?
Jennifer Kneale: Sure. So structurally the way it's set up is effectively so can't be left with ownership. And one of the single assets. So, the way it works is if we, we obviously have the flexibility to call the part of the drop-down interest back in $100 million minimum increment. And so, if we do that is effectively $100 million across the three projects. And so, we can do that in increments until we get to effectively 50% of Stonepeak’s interest remaining and then we'd have to do that acquisition of the interest in a single bullet.
Shneur Gershuni: Got it. Okay. Appreciate the color there. And then finally with respect to the outrigger assets, my understanding is that there's an emerging issue with sour gas there, is that lot of potential revenue generating opportunity for Targo where you were able to handle that for them? And as you answer that if that was to be the case would that be excluded from the earnout structure, if that's an incremental revenue source?
Joe Bob Perkins: I want to start with yes, and then set to Pat McDonie for more color. Yes that, he's starting with is it is an incremental and it is excluded. But the answer is yes, there is sour gas centered around the outrigger assets. It's not fully delineated, but there's pockets of very sweet gas and then there are some pretty nasty stuff and then there are some pretty mild stuff. We do have the capabilities to handle sour gas, honestly it gives us a competitive advantage as we add incremental acreage and you know where the sour gas is going to be located gets better defined. We have an AGI well existing in our Central Basin platform assets which we connected the outrigger assets too. We are building the Wildcat plant which was announced and will be on in April. And with that we will have sour gas capabilities at that facility and plans to add incremental capabilities at that facility in the future. So yes, it is income generating very nice rate of return capability that we do have. And again, it gives us a competitive advantage to add incremental acreage and volumes.
Pat McDonie: And given the amount of active gas we've handled in our Versado Legacy Resort and Sand Hills systems, we are probably as experienced as anyone in the basin to handle kind of that newly forming active gas in Delaware basin.
Shneur Gershuni: Perfect. Thank you very much the color guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from TJ Schultz of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
TJ Schultz: Hey good morning. Just first on that some of the volumes that you talked about. If you could just repeat some of those volumes I think in the fourth quarter, but I guess more importantly what impact maybe in the first quarter? And then it after Joyce is there still going to be a need to head of Johnson and any color on what to assume there in your ‘18 guidance?
Scott Pryor: Yeah. Just to clarify it was 30 million a day in the fourth quarter that was impacted and offloaded to other systems. And I'll turn it over to Pat to give more color.
Pat McDonie: Yeah, I mean when the Joyce Plant comes along as Matt said in his prepared remarks, it'll be full. Obviously, right now we're operating most of our plants on the WestTX system over nameplate capacity. And with that we have a lot of incremental growth and from drilling results from our producer customers. And so, as we look forward to as to our offload needs the initial needs will be done by offloading into our SAOU, utilizing Targo own facilities to facilitate offload from the WestTX system.  We would expect as we approach the startup of Johnson that we're going to be once again in that position where were above nameplate capacity across most of our facilities. Obviously, Joyce field will be reaching the limit as to what we can offload in the SAOU. And Johnson will be just in time. We may have to offload some volumes to third parties. We have the capabilities of doing that. It'll be close. We'll see.
Scott Pryor: And if it's not clear to everybody those are temporary offloads. Just getting to the plant start up an additional capacity and then we get those volumes back. The first of the very next month.
TJ Schultz: Got it. Okay. And then the next question just on CapEx this year you are still biased higher just with new projects are expected to be added. So where is the commercial focus most intensive here. That would be added this year? I guess considering that current guidance I think, are you considers the recent Permian capacity additions announcement and you mentioned the dock work is already in there?
Scott Pryor: The current guidance has - are currently expected currently contracted ramp up of all assets. I guess you would say, an additional commercial effort whether it be on gathering and processing, the pipeline or the downstream will add to those volumes causing them to ramp up faster. And that's all good news.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Sighinolfi of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Corey Goldman: Hey guys it's Corey filling in for Chris. I just wanted to quickly ask about 1.0 agreement that you guys had mentioned in the prepared remarks. I'm sorry if that was already discussed, but is there any more color you can give on that?
Joe Bob Perkins: As you guys, we announced the JV -- with a 50/50 JV with Hess. And what we're referring to as our Little Missouri 4 plant up in the Bakken, as a result of that there was a need for us to acquire an NGL takeaway. We did so, execute a contract with 1.0 for the purposes of that to basically take away the volume that would be produced, the NGL of that would be produced at the Little Missouri 4 plant. The good news about that for us is, is that we were able to approach it in a unique fashion whereby we can actually overtime as the volume increases, exchange those volumes back and have them redelivered to us at our Mont Belvieu facility to feed our fractionation footprint downstream.
Corey Goldman: It's interesting. Thank you. And then just a second question, the frac train, the one that's in the DevCo with Stonepeak, which will be ultimately fed from Grand Prix and obviously your processing facilities. What percentage of that train is contracted to third parties or can you provide a split would have been underpinned by TRGP equity volumes?
Scott Pryor: Yeah, I'd say -- as we are thinking about that next fractionation train. It's a mix of existing customers and future growth. So, we've added third party contractors who talked about four Grand Prix those are we have significant commitments for both transportation and fractionation. So, it's the growth along our Grand Prix pipeline plus our existing, that is really getting us comfort that not only are we going to need transects but we're going to have future growth above and beyond that as well. So, it's a combination above.
Corey Goldman: Okay. And then just last one from 4Q EBITDA, $320 million that's $7 million positive you guys were talking about for roll over from 3Q to 4Q was that all frac or was that frac and LPG?
Jennifer Kneale: No, there was some LPG as well. So, we had a little bit of rollover related LPG and then frac as well.
Corey Goldman: Got you. And Jen can you quantify the LPG or is that not material?
Jennifer Kneale: No, it's not material. It is in $7 million.
Corey Goldman: Got it. Awesome. Thanks guys so much.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Jeremy Tonet: Good morning, this is Jeremy Tonet from JP Morgan here. Thanks. One of your competitors earlier was talking about the ability to kind of use technology to really optimize the G&P business and really ring out costs. Just wondering if you guys see the same as somewhat of a potential at Targa or have done things like this or any thought that you can share on the topic?
Joe Bob Perkins: I'll weigh in on that one. That should not be a new topic. We've been doing that since we founded the company. And at a point in time we've acquired assets that weren't as well integrated to things like scale systems and automatic data recovery. And we very quickly get that to Targa standards and that kind of technology is the correct Targa standard. When we find additional applications, we try to employ them and that should be business as usual. I didn't hear the comments or listened to whatever competitor you're talking about, but if we're not talking about it, it's like other business as usual that we aren't putting on our call.
Jeremy Tonet: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And just wondering as you look at the guidance here and you think about the Permian growth. I was just wondering if you could share with us any thoughts as far as how you think kind of production ramps up across the years that more backend loaded or is there any conservatism built and with kind of completion delays or just any color you can provide on this topic to help us kind of think through your guidance here?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yeah. Good. Good question. We've got a similar question last year when we talked to Permian growth and how it's going to ramp. We see continued growth quarter to quarter. So, you know our internal forecast have Q1 higher than Q2, Q3 and Q4 just ramping through the year. That said, you know sometimes when one compressor stations or parts of one system come on and ramp up it can kind of be lumpy. So, it might not actually happen that way. So, we try and put our best guess on it, but we aren't that good at forecasting each and every well-connected when it's going to come on. So, we're internally forecasting it to kind of ramp throughout the year. I would expect some lumpiness, but we don't have great visibility into that lumpiness. But I think Q4 we expect to be the highest in Q1 we expect to be the low.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yeah, I think I'd bet on that one.
Jeremy Tonet: Yes, that's helpful thanks. And then maybe just expanding beyond to other systems, if you have any thoughts that you could provide as far as the different systems out there, kind of where you're seeing you know more growth versus less?
Joe Bob Perkins: Our guidance to some extent is right and not looking back at the script I'm going from my head. HIAS growth is the Permian and then there are pieces within the Permian. We also expect growth portions of Oklahoma, West Oaks more challenged than south Oaks. I look forward to the day when we the entire Oklahoma complex has offset legacy production by the new SCOOP and STACK. We said that South Texas would be up. We said that the Bakken would be up, North Texas will be down. What I leave off?
Jennifer Kneale: We didn’t guide to the coastal, probably we don’t.
Joe Bob Perkins: But what's the less because that's where we make our money.
Jeremy Tonet: That's helpful I will stop there. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from getting high Darren Horowitz of Raymond James. Your line is open.
Darren Horowitz: Hey guys. Jen just a quick question from a financial optionality perspective, your comment on utilizing additional leverage what magnitude of additional leverage are you comfortable with on a consolidated debt to EBITDA perspective exiting this year? And from a timing perspective, you know once you get to that 50% capital threshold, how is that the use of leverage how does that factor into buying back those assets from Stonepeak?
Jennifer Kneale: Yeah and I mean I think from our perspective we don't really have what I call sort of a line in the sand related to leverage. It's partially going to depend on what we see during the year related to fundamentals and volumes and sort of where we are on our expected EBITDA and not only for this year obviously but beyond this year. And so, I think that given that we over equities significantly in 2017 that means, we're better positioned now in 2018 and especially as a result of the DevCos as well taking significant funding out of 2018 and 2019. So, our current leverage is about 3.8 times at TRP versus the compliance covenant of 5.5 times, I think we're willing to take it a little bit higher. I think it's largely dependent on how long it would be higher for so the number of periods that we expect it to be elevated before the EBITDA really started to ramp in and bring it back down to where we're ultimately more comfortable operating and that's where a three to four times range.
Joe Bob Perkins: I also like to get the math on your question everyone should not forget the wonderful thing about that that debt to EBITDA ratio is in this current environment we are spending the dollars upfront and then comes the EBITDA. So, the denominators then get a whole lot better if you look at that long term forecast we're talking about. And as that denominator getting better that lets us buy back the Stonepeak interest. It's not increasing leverage at that point, it's decreasing leverage because EBITDA is growing.
Darren Horowitz: Right. I appreciate that. And if I could add one quick follow up Jen from a cost to capital perspective how much do you calculate that the Stonepeak JV DevCo structure benefited you, even building in a predetermined rate of return that's kept low single digits plus or minus any contingency. How much savings do you think you got relative to doing more traditional JV structure like what you do with Blackstone on Grand Prix initially?
Jennifer Kneale: Yeah, we're not going to quantify the savings we've sort of characterized it as we’ll ultimately, the structural ultimately cost us is based on a predetermined fixed return that we certainly think is incredibly attractive even versus our current comment if you look at our yield and then assume some sort of a growth component on it. And then there are other facets related to scale that I alluded to earlier in terms of flexibility and some other things that are incredibly important to us. And when we looked at it, it was really the temporary nature of the DevCo structure that was a big focal point for us. That was part of how we designed the structure was we were thinking about what we put in our capital structure that was temporary. And so, when we think about our long-term outlook for EBITDA growth there is a chance that given that increasing impact and given where we expect our leverage to be over that sort of timeframe that we could take this out that we could take it out with obviously some equity, leverage, a mix of the two. And I think that that's part of what ultimately could result in this being a significantly lower cost than certainly issuing something like common - that amount of common at today's price would have been.
Darren Horowitz: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christine Cho of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Christine Cho: Hi. I just have one question, with your Permian volumes being an access fee and POP and Permian gas base is flowing out. Can you give us an idea of what your exposure to that is and how easy is it to hedge that at least until Gulf Coast expresses online?
Scott Pryor: Sure, I'll start with that. On the Midland Basins side, it's primarily POP and fee-based contracts over there too, but it's primarily POP. On the Delaware side it's a mix. You know the outrigger acquisition was almost primarily or almost entirely fee based. So, we have a mix of both. For our POP component, we are exposed as we get our percentage of proceeds of the gas to basis. So, one of the points we made when we're talking about hedging, when we hedge our exposure to the POP contract were lone gas, we don't just hedge Henry Hub we hedge basin. So, we'll hedge Waha and El Paso Permian. So, our '18 numbers do reflect that and even our hedges beyond there. We do hedge at Waha and El Paso Permian. So, but overtime we think with GCX over time that large base that we see now is going to is going to start there.
Joe Bob Perkins: And I think there was a piece of the question in there that said how easy is it to hedge that? Point one, it's very easy and very liquid and very transparent. What the market believes that is at any point in time and far more liquid than our NGL hedges. On the other hand, our investment in SCX helps change that equation. It gets an important pipe done to some extent, hedges our position and definitely will reduce basis. The good thing about high basis is it's all high basis and that's good for our interest as a process processor and our producers interest from their position.
Christine Cho: Thank you for that. And actually, had to have one follow up, do you guys foresee gas residual issues first stack scoop more specifically is there a target date or expectations that that gas is going to go to Waha? And then you know a Gulf Coast from there.
Joe Bob Perkins: I don't think it's expected that I'll get to Waha, in the interim there'll be some issues seasonally and in particular areas of this scoop stack but you know soon announced the pipeline it's getting built that will relieve those issues in the interim period. Gas will move the traditional ways it has through the pipes and try to move it to the upper Midwest or to the east. So that make a lot of sense when Waha is growing at an oversupply per mid county gas to show up the Waha. So, the expectation well anything that can be moved down to North Texas will be moved out of North Texas and everything else will go in traditionally where it has come.
Christine Cho: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sunil Sibal of Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.
Sunil Sibal: Hi good morning guys and congratulations to everybody on the promotions and a good quarter. Couple of questions for me, so when we look at Permian Delaware volumes in Q4, it seems like there were flat sequentially. I was kind of wondering was there any kind of onetime issues that impacted that? And I know you mentioned that will freeze offs. How should we kind of think about the Delaware portion of the Permian in the next couple of quarters?
Scott Pryor: Sure, we were impacted by some maintenance events at Versado in the fourth quarter relative to the third. So those were relatively flat actually down a couple million a day. The longer term, if you look for 2018 and beyond we see significant growth out in the Delaware. So, I didn't really grow too much relative to Q3. We do see continued growth going forward and it was a maintenance impact at Versado on the quarter.
Joe Bob Perkins: And I think what I would add is that, because of the cold weather even with some freeze offs etc. what occurs is, you get a lot more heated triggers being run to make sure that the oil is coming out of the ground. So, you have a lot more consumption of natural gas at the wellhead. That also takes gas away from what ultimately gets delivered in to our gathering and processing facilities. So, you see a combination of that and weather not only affects in the freezing mechanism, but it also for heater or treated purposes etc. So, we think volumes are growing we see it, as kind of a hiccup, but it's not anything we haven't seen before anything even remotely concerned about it.
Sunil Sibal: Got it. And then on the 14 guidance you spit out, the split contribution for 2018. As you know is there any kind of onetime issues impacting that number or is that a kind of a good great run rate going forward?
Joe Bob Perkins: I'm not sure I understood the question. Would you repeat it again?
Sunil Sibal: Yeah. So, when I look at your ‘18 guidance split I think noble splitter project contribution is indicated as about 10 million for full year ‘18. I was kind of curious are there any onetime items impacting that number or is that a good run rate going forward?
Jennifer Kneale: Well over knows splitter obviously comes on line this year and so we'll have OpEx associated with the splitter once it's online. And so, I think if you think about the sort of $43 million payments that we have been receiving in October of every year we've sort of guided to kind of net margin associate with that you know being sort of in the $30 million-ish range, when you take into account of OpEx.
Sunil Sibal: Okay. And then just to clarify on the on the five-year kind of guidance that you had given out for 2021 seems like, on the Slide 10 that those deck is still using the same products that were used in July. I was wondering you know just to kind of benchmark our models, how should we do thinking about the CapEx in that you know base guidance that you gave back in July in terms of the CapEx from 2018 to 2020?
Joe Bob Perkins: To be clear what appears on Page 10 of the deck is a repeat of what we showed in June, called it on the first, two-thirds of the page from the left side and then a new column which says recent additions to EBITDA growth outlook. It's not a new forecast, it wasn’t a forecast to begin with there was an outlook, it's not a new outlook it's showing that there have been changes made since the previous outlook and those changes are the new commercial agreements, GCX, the joint venture in the Bakken the expanded joint venture in Centrahoma. So, I don't want the chart to be misunderstood by anyone who hasn't seen it. I think that we've got a new long-term guidance page out there, we don't. Our script comments did say they were mine, I kind of remember them. I did say that, we believe that the outlook we gave in June is even better today. And then we discuss the reasons. So, I really can't help we help you with your modelling beyond that and any sort of transcript of this will list those reasons and some of those reasons are listed on page 10 in that packet. Does that help?
Sunil Sibal: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dennis Coleman of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Dennis Coleman: Yes, thanks for sticking with me. There are lots of good questions have been asked. I just have more of I think gave more of a detailed one. You mentioned in the agreement with one or two to move the liquids that you could potentially just exchange the volumes. I guess that take volumes that one has it at you or some shape that is what I'm imagining. Is there a basis negotiated into those kind of agreements, has that already been anticipated or do you just do that at market? How does that work?
Joe Bob Perkins: We recognize that the agreement -- the agreement that we have, obviously ONEOK has the pipe today -- OH LP pipe today and then they've got the announcement of their Elk Creek Pipe. Practically speaking it's my understanding that the current pipe is virtually full, so the additive of Elk Creek provides the transportation lag to move the barrels to the various marketplaces. For us we just viewed as a transportation exchange, we're delivering barrels at Bakken and overtime an increasing amount of volumes will be redeliver back to us that at our Mont Belvieu fractionators. Not going to get into that settlement prices or how that works? But needless to say, it is beneficial to target to have those lines that our fractionators.
Dennis Coleman: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes our question and answer session for today. I like to turn the conference back over to the company for any closing remarks.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks operator and thanks to everybody on the call this morning. We hope that the additional color in 2018 guidance was helpful. Please feel free to contact Sanjay, Jen or any of us to follow up. Have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Sanjay. Good morning and thanks to everyone for joining, especially given all the recent late night Astros games. What a series. And I have to say it feels a whole lot better to be doing this call this morning rather than yesterday morning when I was a little bit grumpy. The Targa team is very proud of our hometown World Series champs. So, let’s get started. First, I want to acknowledge the heroic efforts of many Targa employees during Hurricane Harvey. I am inspired by the Targa team’s dedicated efforts to ensure the continued safe operations of our facilities during and in the aftermath of the storm. And I am very thankful to those who worked tirelessly to communicate with our customers and to mitigate the impact of the storm for our customers and for our shareholders. Our third quarter operating margin was reduced by approximately $11 million due to the impact from Hurricane Harvey, but we expect to recover and recognize approximately $7 million of that impact in the fourth quarter. And despite the approximately $4 million net impact of Harvey, our previously disclosed full year 2017 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.13 billion remains unchanged. Given the catastrophic impact of Harvey, many of the communities around our assets and on the residences and cars of our employees, the modest impact on our results exemplifies the impressive efforts of our employees despite the storm. Similarly, our employees worked very hard to minimize the effects of Hurricane Nate on some of our Louisiana assets in early October, and we expect the impact of that hurricane on our fourth quarter to be negligible. Other than Hurricanes Harvey and Nate, 2017 is largely playing out as forecasted for Targa, with the second quarter representing an expected trough of adjusted EBITDA for the year and with EBITDA sequentially increasing over the second half of the year, as we benefit from increasing volumes across most of our gathering and processing systems and across our downstream assets. We remain on track to meet or exceed all of the volume metric and financial guidance that we provided for this year and fundamentals affecting Targa’s day-to-day business continue to improve. While backward dated, WTI crude oil prices for the balance of 2017 through 2021 are higher than the $50 per barrel flat that we assumed in the longer-term guidance that we provided in June. The current weighted average target NGL composite barrel is about $0.74, significantly above the $0.60 per gallon flat price assumed in our guidance and above the average approximately $0.60 per gallon we have seen for the first three quarters of this year. Obviously, higher NGL prices can provide our businesses with some additional tailwinds for the future. We are also on track and remain focused on executing on our key strategic initiatives underway, including: first, investing in economically attractive projects that leverage our existing infrastructure and further strengthen our competitive advantage, adding over 1 billion cubic feet per day of incremental gas processing capacity in 2017 and 2018, with most of that, as you know, located in the Permian Basin; to handle increasing volumes that we are seeing around our assets across both the Midland and Delaware basins and continuing progress on our 300,000 barrel per day Grand Prix NGL pipeline; retaining the strategic benefits and enhancing the economics and de risking the projects by bringing in an attractive financial partner in Blackstone; and executing a long-term agreement for transportation and fractionation with an attractive strategic partner in EagleClaw. Additionally, in early October, we announced that we executed a letter of intent with Kinder Morgan and DCP to jointly develop the proposed Gulf Coast Express Pipeline Project, also called GCX, which would provide an outlet for increased natural gas production from the Permian Basin to growing markets along the Texas Gulf Coast. Assuming documents are finalized per the LOI, we would be a 25% equity partner in GCX, bringing significant residue gas volumes to the pipeline from our Delaware and Midland Basin footprints. For Targa, the fee-based returns on GCX would be attractive and meaningful once the pipeline is in service. And most importantly, the pipeline would provide reliable takeaways for our customers from the Permian Basin to premium markets along the Texas Gulf Coast. As we have discussed previously, Targa is one of the largest daily movers of NGLs and residue gas out of the Permian Basin as a result of a great asset position and organic growth and third-party acquisitions that we have made across the Midland and Delaware basins over the last several years. And now, our Grand Prix NGL pipeline joint venture and our GCX residue gas pipeline joint venture leverage that franchise Permian position. Executing our strategic objectives requires capital and we currently estimate 2018 net capital expenditures to be approximately $1.6 billion for our currently announced major projects and associated infrastructure. There are a number of other potential capital projects that we’re working on, which have not been announced. Some of these I will continue to characterize as when and not if. Of course, including additional fractionation and not yet announced, but ultimately expected additional gas processing plants in the Permian. Such potential new projects are leveraged to Permian activity and leveraged to other Targa infrastructure, which provides attractive rates of return and continued best-in-class service offerings for our customers. It is reasonable to assume that if the volume trends continue for Permian gathering and processing and for downstream fractionation, then some of these potential projects may have associated spending in 2018. And 2018 CapEx, in that instance, could be greater than $1.6 billion. We will, of course, provide a full CapEx update with 2018 guidance in February of 2018, and we will provide CapEx updates with any major new announcement. This year, we raised a significant amount of public equity concurrent with the announcements of both our Permian acquisition and the Grand Prix project. And we raised equity through our ATM program earlier in the year. As we had signaled early in 2017, we over equitized. From our perspective, these were important steps to support our balance sheet and enhance our financial flexibility, as exemplified by our leverage ratio of 3.7x at TRP at the end of the third quarter, which is within our 3x to 4x long-term target range. That’s been the range as long as I can remember. For 2018, our financing plan is consistent with best practices. For 2018, our financing plan is consistent with best past practices. We will finance with a combination of debt and equity, consider public and private capital, continue to consider creative joint ventures, and potential asset sales. And given the visibility we have to increasing EBITDA, we will also have the option to fund our capital program with more debt than equity, which will provide us with a favorable tailwind related to financing. So given that we over equitized in 2017, we have a strong balance sheet, a very liquid public security and increasing EBITDA that allows us to potentially fund with more debt than equity, we believe that our equity needs for 2018 are very manageable. Alternatively, there is a lot of appetite in the private capital markets, as demonstrated by our Grand Prix JV and other market transactions out there, appetite to fund a portion of Targa’s growth or to purchase a portion of our assets. We, of course, are actively considering multiple alternatives and structures, which could supplement or replace our public equity capital needs at relatively attractive cost of capital. Additionally, our ability to continue to raise attractive debt capital was highlighted by our notes offering that closed in October, as Targa issued $750 million of 5% senior notes due in 2028. Net proceeds from that offering were used to redeem our 5% senior notes due in 2018 and to reduce borrowings under the TRP revolver and accounts receivable securitization facility. Pro forma for the notes offering, our liquidity was approximately $2 billion. For Targa, we believe that we are executing on strategic initiatives that will drive significant shareholder value over the longer term. As exemplified by the information that we presented in June of this year, a long-term outlook showing expected adjusted EBITDA to almost double over 5 years, growing from approximately $1.13 billion in 2017 to approximately $1.5 billion in 2019 and approximately $2 billion in 2021. And I will tell you, we feel even better about that outlook today than we did in June. The forecasted EBITDA growth is not predicated on a commodity price recovery and is supported by visible fundamentals continuing to provide tailwinds to our business, for example, continued Permian activity for example, additional petrochemical capacity. We believe that we will outperform that EBITDA growth forecast on multiple dimensions. In building that outlook, we assume no additional commercial execution over the time frame. I will take that over, no additional gathering and processing contracts and no additional LPG export contracts. Also in building that outlook for EBITDA in that time frame, we assume we added one additional frac and built two processing plants to support contracts we already have in place. That was not an overly robust assumption. Please consider that since the June long-term EBITDA outlook, we potentially are adding the commercial opportunity in the GCF project. And we have also added attractive G&P in downstream contracts and we expect to further enhance our positions going forward. We are spending significant cash flow on our announced projects and have taken steps over the last 2 years to have the balance sheet strength, flexibility and demonstrated access to public and private capital that supports our attractive growth projects opportunities as we complete them and they begin to generate significant incremental EBITDA. Consistent with how we have previously described our financial priorities, our first priority is to take care of our balance sheet, providing us with stability and flexibility and to maintain or improve leverage and dividend coverage over time. We have told you, every quarter, we provide our board with a recommendation for the dividend for the quarter, which is based on our strategy, our long-term outlook and multiyear forecast. Our quarterly dividend has been $0.91 per common share since the third quarter of 2015. And while we have not yet published specific guidance for 2018, assuming we will continue to recommend the quarterly dividend of $0.91 per common share in 2018, is consistent with our recent track record. Looking forward over the longer term, we have significant visibility to increasing EBITDA. And as our growth projects underway begin operations and cash flows improve, our balance sheet will continue to strengthen. We will reduce leverage and increase coverage. This improved leverage and coverage outlook will be taken into account in future dividend discussions with our board as will market-driven approaches to pay out and the best use of the higher coverage to most effectively provide our shareholders with attractive returns. That’s our job and that’s what we will do. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jen to discuss Targa’s results for the third quarter.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks, Joe Bob. Good morning, everyone. Before I get started, I’d like to recognize Sanjay for coming up with our new investor presentation look from scratch that you hopefully noticed in our materials posted on our website this morning. Targa’s reported adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $276.5 million, which was 13% higher than the same period in 2016. Continued strong volume growth in Permian G&P, complemented by higher volumes in the Badlands, SouthTX and SouthOK, along with higher commodity prices and higher fractionation volumes, drove the increase in adjusted EBITDA over the prior year. Reported net maintenance capital expenditures were $24 million in the third quarter of 2017 compared to $20 million in the third quarter of 2016. We continue to estimate approximately $110 million of net maintenance CapEx for 2017. Distributable cash flow for the third quarter was $186.6 million, resulting in dividend coverage of approximately 0.85x, which is consistent with the expectations that we had for the third quarter and includes the impact of Hurricane Harvey. In October, we received the $43 million annual payment related to the Channelview crude and condensate splitter. So for full year 2017, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $1.13 billion and full year 2017 dividend coverage to be between 0.95 and 1x. Moving to our sequential results. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter increased 7% over the second quarter. In our Gathering and Processing segment, operating margin increased by $24.8 million in the third quarter when compared to the second quarter, primarily due to higher inlet volumes in the Permian, Badlands, SouthTX and SouthOK in addition to higher NGL prices. Third quarter Permian inlet volumes sequentially increased 7% from growth in each of our Permian Midland and Permian Delaware systems. In the Badlands in North Dakota, third quarter natural gas volumes increased by approximately 17%. Inlet volumes in SouthTX sequentially increased 48% over the second quarter, as we benefited from full quarter operations of the new Raptor plant and higher volumes from Sanchez in addition to incremental volumes from the acquisition of Boardwalk Flag City assets and fee-based contracts. Volumes also sequentially increased in SouthOK as we continued to benefit from incremental SCOOP volumes on our system that were more than sufficient to offset legacy production declines. While we are only 1 month into the fourth quarter, our inlet volumes for overall Field G&P, driven by the Permian, SouthTX, SouthOK and Badlands are higher than our third quarter average Field G&P volumes, and we remain on track to meet our full year 2017 Field and Permian volume expectations that we provided earlier this year. More importantly, the trajectory also provides a strong outlook for 2018. While we are not providing formal guidance at this time, directionally, we expect significant year-over-year growth in total Permian volumes in 2018 and expect the positive volume momentum in SouthTX, Badlands and SouthOK to also carry into 2018. Turning to the Bakken, Badlands crude oil gathered volumes were approximately 109,000 barrels per day in the third quarter, down slightly over the second quarter due to the timing of well completions. Permian crude volumes gathered in the third quarter were approximately 36,000 barrels per day, and we expect this positive trend to continue. In our Downstream segment, operating margin sequentially increased $3.5 million in the third quarter when compared to the second quarter. The segment was essentially flat sequentially, as improved underlying business performance was partially offset by lower margins in our fractionation and LPG export businesses due to the impacts from Hurricane Harvey. Fractionation margin decreased largely due to the deferral of supply volume settlements resulting from temporary operational issues due to Hurricane Harvey. LPG export margin decreased sequentially, as some volumes were deferred to the fourth quarter due to the temporary closure of the Houston Ship Channel as a result of Hurricane Harvey. When normalized for the effects of temporary operational issues attributable to Hurricane Harvey, third quarter fractionation volumes would have been approximately 359,000 barrels per day or 6% higher than the second quarter. In our LPG export business, approximately 4.7 million barrels per month of propane and butanes were exported from our facility, and we received fees from 2 vessel cancellations during the quarter. LPG export volumes would have been approximately 5.1 million barrels per month or 8% higher than the second quarter when normalized for the effects of Hurricane Harvey. Consistent with what we are seeing in Gathering and Processing, our fractionation and LPG export volumes for the fourth quarter are also expected to be higher than the third quarter averages. While we are still working through our planning process for 2018, the expected strength in exit rate volumes across our segments, coupled with strengthening fundamentals, provides us with a visibility to increasing year-over-year adjusted EBITDA. Overall, operating expenses during the third quarter in both our G&P and Downstream segments were essentially flat to the second quarter. And looking forward, we expect OpEx to increase as new assets and facilities come online. Moving on to 2017 capital spending and other financial matters, we expect 2017 net growth CapEx of approximately $1.3 billion based on our announced projects, inclusive of our Grand Prix joint venture with Blackstone. We continue to get a lot of questions related to the earn-out structure of our Permian acquisitions that closed on March 1. After each quarter during the earn-out period, we update our estimates for the expected earn-out payments, comparing current expectations to the forecast developed prior to acquisition close. From our perspective, the volume growth that we expected when we closed the acquisition has materialized more slowly, which is a situation that we obviously contemplated in developing an earn-out structure where additional consideration accrues to the sellers only if the assets performed over the defined near-term earn-out period. Currently, the aggregate earn-out payment is estimated to be approximately $291 million and is expected to be predominantly weighted towards the second payment due in April 2019, with a much smaller payment forecasted for April 2018. The reduced aggregate earn-out payment estimate is attributable to currently projected production from contracts that were executed prior to acquisition close being lower than our estimates at the time of the acquisition. While volumes are still expected to grow significantly over the earn-out period, the near-term growth is lower than our acquisition case. And the earn-out structure means that we would, therefore, pay less than previously forecasted for the earn-out payments. Growth beyond the earn-out payments – growth beyond the earn-out periods and margin from new contracts entered into after acquisition close accrued to Targa’s sole benefit. Most importantly, we continue to feel very good about the long-term value of the acquisition to Targa. During the third quarter, we also recorded a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $378 million related to our North Texas operations. Obviously, we have seen volumes and activity levels continue to decrease in the Barnett, which are driving the impairment. The impairment does not impact Targa’s cash flow, DCS, EBITDA, leverage ratios or any other meaningful metrics. Turning to our corporate hedging program, we executed additional hedges during the third quarter, as we saw some price strength in certain commodities, particularly for the balance of 2017. We estimate that we have now hedged approximately 95% of natural gas volumes, 90% of NGL volumes and 75% of condensate exposure for the remainder of this year. For 2018, we estimate that we have hedged approximately 80% of natural gas volumes, 50% of NGL volumes and 50% of condensate exposure. I will now turn the call over to Pat, who leads our Southern Field G&P business. Pat?
Pat McDonie: Thanks, Jen and good morning everybody. As Joe Bob mentioned, system volumes in our Gathering and Processing segment continue to increase tracking our expectations for the year and we expect this positive trend to continue. In the Permian, we are working hard to keep pace with our producers and we remain focused on continuing to add infrastructure to meet their growth needs. Starting in the Permian Delaware, in addition to the adding gathering lines, compression and treating capabilities, we are on track to begin operations on our 60 million cubic feet per day Oahu plant in the fourth quarter. Construction also continues on our 250 million cubic feet per day Wildcat plant, which is expected online in the second quarter of 2018. In the fourth quarter, all of our Delaware assets will be fully interconnected, increasing our operational flexibility as volumes continue to ramp. In the Permian Midland, production growth continues at a rapid pace. And in October, we connected our recently acquired Midland assets to our WestTX assets. The much-needed 200 million cubic feet per day Joyce plant is on track to begin service in the first quarter of 2018. And the 200 million cubic feet per day Johnson plant is expected to begin service shortly thereafter in the third quarter of 2018. We expect that both plants will be highly utilized when they come online, immediately contributing to our interconnected multi-plant footprint across the Permian to provide significant additional flexibility as we are able to move volumes between systems and from Permian Midland to Permian Delaware and vice-versa. We have looped more gathering lines and added more compression in 2017 than originally expected as a result of producer volume growth. This incremental infrastructure will increase our long-term growth capability across our Permian assets, which is important based on our most recent conversations with our producers, who continue to forecast strong growth in both the Midland and Delaware basins beyond 2017. Moving to our Oklahoma assets, our outlook continues to strengthen as we benefit from commercial – continued commercial success and increasing production on our dedicated acreage. Third quarter inlet volumes for SouthOK were approximately 8% higher than the second quarter, and we expect volumes to continue to increase through the fourth quarter and into 2018 due to continued commercial success, system expansion and a recently completed line that is bringing additional SCOOP volumes to our system. In SouthTX, system inlet volumes increased 48% sequentially over the second quarter as we benefited from a full quarter of operations of our new 200 million cubic feet per day Raptor plant that began flowing gas in late May and from incremental volumes from the second quarter acquisition of Broadwalk Flag City assets and fee-based contracts. We decommissioned the Flag City plant and our processing volumes from the acquired Flag City contracts at our Silver Oak facilities. We expect to move the Flag City plant and the other acquired assets for use elsewhere in the Targa G&P business. We also recently completed the 60 million cubic feet per day expansion of the Raptor plant and the additional capacity, now a total of 260 million cubic feet per day of Raptor, will help support the volume growth that we expect in South Texas through the fourth quarter in and through 2018. I will now turn the call over to Scott Pryor, who leads our Downstream Business. Scott?
Scott Pryor: Thanks, Pat and good morning to everyone. As we look forward into the rest of the fourth quarter and beyond, our Downstream Business continues to be very well positioned to benefit from a number of tailwinds. First, we had higher sequential fractionation volumes, driven by higher Field G&P inlet volumes, a trend that we expect to continue. We also are seeing renewed interest in long-term fractionation deals, reflecting a tightening of capacity in Mont Belvieu. Secondly, greater ethane extraction as new Gulf Coast petrochemical demand continues to improve the ethane frac spread, which will drive higher fractionation volumes for Targa over time. We expect 150,000 barrels per day of new cracker demand by the end of this year and incremental 300,000 barrels per day by the end of 2018 and additional growth in 2019 and beyond and the vast majority of the expansions and new builds are located along the Gulf Coast. And third, we currently are well positioned and will continue to strategically position ourselves to benefit from increasing upstream supply growth and increasing downstream demand growth, including via the Grand Prix NGL pipeline and by adding or expanding new connections to markets downstream from our fractionators. Shifting to our LPG export business, we loaded 4.7 million barrels per month of LPGs for the third quarter, received cancellation fees for 2 vessels and had a couple of vessels move into the fourth quarter schedule as a result of Hurricane Harvey temporarily closing the Houston Ship Channel. For the fourth quarter, we expect LPG export volumes to increase versus the third quarter. Looking forward, the long-term outlook for LPG export business is unchanged, given our substantial long-term contract position and favorable global fundamentals, driven by continued international demand growth and the U.S.’s position as the likely supplier to feed that growing demand. We expect U.S. upstream production to continue growing even without a significant increase in prices, creating a strong supply outlook for U.S. commodity exports. Moving on to our Grand Prix NGL pipeline project, Grand Prix will connect our strong and growing franchise Permian Basin footprint to our very well positioned downstream assets at Mont Belvieu. It is a game-changer for Targa that bolsters our positioning by enhancing a highly competitive, fully integrated service offering to our current and future customers, leveraging each piece of the Targa value chain. Over the long-term, Grand Prix will provide significant and increasingly fee-based earnings, reducing our reliability and obligation to third-party pipelines, while helping to direct incremental volumes to our downstream facilities. Targa has the largest G&P position in the Permian Basin. And with good visibility on substantial growth in the future, significantly more NGLs will be directed to Targa’s downstream assets. While further increasing the utilization of our existing downstream facilities, this presents attractive capital investment opportunities, including additional fractionation. We believe that our partnership with Blackstone and NGL dedication and commitment from EagleClaw is a beneficial transaction for our shareholders and a great deal for Targa. We were very openly public that we were considering a number of different opportunities related to a joint venture on Grand Prix or alternative NGL pipes, and the transactions that we announced strongly fulfilled our stated goals to retain the strategic benefits of an NGL pipe connecting to our G&P and Downstream Business and to enhance target economics and to de risk the project. We reduced our capital funding obligation and identified a committed strategic partner that will drive higher overall project returns as a result of dedicated and committed volumes they will bring to the pipeline over time. We also continue to add other third-party customers and are very pleased with our progress since announcing the project in May. As the expected volumes flowing through Grand Prix increase over time, we will realize significant fee-based cash flow from the asset, with returns for the standalone project ultimately somewhere between 5x and 7x CapEx as a multiple of EBITDA, potentially reaching those levels more quickly depending on continued commercial success and pace of volume growth. These simplified multiples are not inclusive of any of the other strategic benefits of the NGL pipeline. Overall, the outlook for Targa’s Downstream Business is highly robust, driven by the continued integration with our growing G&P business and the flow of NGLs to our strong downstream asset position along the U.S. Gulf Coast. And with that, I’ll turn the call back over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Scott. Hopefully, we were able to provide you with some color to support our view that there is a lot of positive momentum within Targa right now, supported by strengthening fundamentals and exemplified by the strong volume trends we are seeing in both our Gathering and Processing and Downstream segments at this point early in the fourth quarter. The capital investment program that we have underway is expected to generate visible and significant growth and cash flows to our shareholders over the long term. And we believe that we have the balance sheet flexibility and demonstrated access to public and private capital to manageably fund our growth program. Our team at Targa remains focused on continuing to execute on our strategic objectives, and our team is working as a team better than I’ve ever seen it before, downstream with upstream, business units with other business units, commercial, engineering, operations, accounting, planning, it’s inspiring and that team is very excited about Targa’s strong long-term outlook. So with that, operator, please open up the lines for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from TJ Schultz from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning, TJ.
TJ Schultz: Good morning. I guess, first just funding plans, I appreciate the commentary for next year, the debt leverage at TRP, 3.7 now, I think you said, what level are you comfortable taking this next year ahead of the cash flow ramp that you see in 2019?
Joe Bob Perkins: I don’t have a new guidance for you, TJ, but if you have listened to us over the years and I know you have, that 3x to 4x long-term target range is the zone that we try to stay in. It’s not the monthly zone or the quarterly zone, but it is the zone we try to stay in with a whole lot of visibility towards those future cash flows, increasing leverage at TRP that was 4.1 or something like that. I wouldn’t feel any different, because it’s improving over time, but that is what we were talking about. Because we have visibility on increasing the EBITDA, it gives us the option, the option over 2018 and into 2019 to fund our capital program with more debt than equity, unlike 2017 where we said we would over equitize it.
TJ Schultz: Got it. And then as we think about the ramp in 2019 with Grand Prix, with the JV in place now, your kind of current view on volumes, what’s the timeframe to get to that 5x to 7x targeted returns or just any general comments on the ramp we should expect?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, general comment on the ramp. Take a little bit of a step back. When we first announced the project, what we told folks is that the Targa managed volumes by themselves were attractive economics. We didn’t describe the exact ramp, but ramping Targa’s managed volumes created attractive economics. Since that time, the Blackstone and EagleClaw JV have added significant volumes, not near-term volumes, but longer term volumes that make those economics a whole lot more attractive and the addition of additional third-party volumes since we announced the project are meaningful. If you have got attractive economics, an incremental barrel goes essentially straight to the bottom line and that enhances our position. I think what I’d say is we haven’t pointed to the point where 5x to 7x, which is a simplified measure as you know of returns occurs, but we went from nice economics to even nicer economics with the improving volume outlook and we are continuing to add to that. Does that help?
TJ Schultz: No, that’s good. I appreciate it. I’ll just leave it there.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you, sir.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is open.
Shneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning, guys. I was wondering if we could sort of start off on the upside CapEx number of $1.6 billion. I was wondering what would be the blue sky scenario that would get us there? Does that include the participation net to Targa in the Gulf Coast pipeline as well as is Grand Prix adjusting for the investment that you got? I was wondering, if you can also give us a sense on what type of volume growth we would need to see in 2018 that would give us that high end. If you can provide some sensitivities, that would be helpful.
Joe Bob Perkins: I will provide some additional color. First of all, the $1.6 billion is our current estimate of 2018 dollars for our currently announced major projects and associated infrastructure. It does not include GCX, which you mentioned. And I don’t consider it to be blue sky or upside. I consider it to be a good estimate of the currently announced projects at this time with the planning process still underway. And I said that there were other potential capital projects that we were working on that were not in that $1.6 billion 2018 estimate. Those projects aren’t really new or mysterious projects. They are projects that we have talked about in the past and I was sort of laughing at myself for often saying, these projects are when and not if. That would include the very likely addition of more fractionation to keep up with those volumes. You asked for volume sensitivity relative to that, I would say if we continue on the range of forecast of current volume trends from the Permian Basin in the SCOOP/STACK and those resulting volumes as they go to ultimately our pipeline, but as they go to Mont Belvieu that those projects both on the G&P side and the fractionation side are likely to create additional dollars in 2018. So it’s not sensitivity, it’s a direction. And that direction is we are very likely to spend more than $1.6 billion. We’re not trying to hide it from you. We believe that as we announce those projects in early 2018 or whenever they become done deals and ready for public exposure, we’ll provide updates on our total CapEx at that time. And we will provide sort of our traditionally detailed by major project and other related infrastructure summary in February of 2018. Is that helpful?
Shneur Gershuni: Yes, absolutely. It is helpful. As a couple of follow-ups, given where NGL prices and natural gas prices are today, do you have some sort of sensitivity on what do you think the positive tailwind could be for 2018 versus 2017 given your current hedge position?
Joe Bob Perkins: We show a – 2017, I don’t think we are sensitivity, I don’t think we are yet showing a 2018 sensitivity. We did describe how much was hedged in 2018 versus 2017, so that probably gives you the ability to triangulate on it a bit.
Jennifer Kneale: Yes. And Shneur, the only other point that I would add is for 2018, that’s based on what our current equity volumes are. So, to the extent that obviously we have more volumes running through our system, from our POP contracts, our equity volumes would be higher during 2018, so that would be additional potential upside that isn’t reflected when we give you these hedge statistics.
Shneur Gershuni: Great. That makes perfect sense. And then one last follow-up, there has been a lot of talk about completion crews in the Permian being a challenge. I was wondering if you could opine on whether you think this issue is over-reported as a bigger concern than it actually is. And maybe if you can talk to what you are seeing both on your legacy Targa footprints as well as on the Outrigger footprints in terms of rate of change on completion crews?
Joe Bob Perkins: The completion crews on legacy assets versus recently acquired assets, I don’t have a differentiation on it. Larger players have better access to crews than some of the smaller players. And if you’ve contracted for rigs or pumping equipment, you’ve also somewhat contracted for those crews. We’ve said over previous quarters that we believe that there was issues with equipment and workforces. That was a frictional slow down to the more robust forecast that you might read out there from various analysts. And that we, therefore, thought you don’t want to be looking at the high size of all of those forecasts because of those frictional constraints, but the fact is excellent economics in the Permian Basin incent additional equipment and incent the people with the equipment to get the crews back to work. Ultimately, those problems get solved.
Shneur Gershuni: And so in the third quarter, was it any better than the second quarter?
Joe Bob Perkins: That would – I would be pretending to have a greater granularity than I have got to describe one quarter versus the other. By producers, I know I heard some of the same issues in the third quarter that I heard in the second quarter.
Pat McDonie: And to be fair, no, would be the answer. It’s not materially different. And honestly, as Joe Bob mentioned, we have an awful lot of producers that have the longer-term agreements and have the ability to bypass the issue that some of the smaller players are experiencing. And certainly Pioneer has their own drilling rigs, their own completion rigs and their own sand mines. So them being one of the bigger players in our system, the XTOs, the Chevrons, the COGs, the Parsleys, etcetera, all those guys have a lot of capabilities now. We do have a lot of other players that are contracted to us. And some of the issues have been minimal, but have been there. But with that, they have also had better results than what were expected. So fewer wells are producing really look-alike volumes to what were expected relative to the slowdown they are seeing as far as completion rigs, etcetera.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, that kind of puncture weights the volume growth you are seeing quarter-over-quarter. And we certainly wouldn’t be sounding the alarm that, that kind of quarter-to-quarter improvement can’t continue. And we said I hope loudly and clearly that our 2017 volume expectations are on track, both for the Permian and for our overall Southern Field Gathering and Processing, overall Field Gathering and Processing.
Shneur Gershuni: Perfect. Thank you very much, guys. Really appreciate all the color.
Operator: Thanks, sir. Your next question comes from the line of the Vikram Bagri from Citi. Your line is open.
Vikram Bagri: Good morning. I believe I heard a comment about market-driven approach for dividend going forward. I just wanted to better understand that comment, if you are maintaining a healthy coverage at all times given the recent announcements by some of your peers or is it more of a function of capital needs and you retaining more cash flows, potentially including ATM if your capital programs grow significantly from the $1.6 million?
Joe Bob Perkins: Understood, Vikram. I mean, there have been recent company-specific-driven announcements and approaches over the last quarter. I guess it all started sometime ago when Kinder cut a dividend just day investment grade and the dialogue has continued in between those points. What we said was that our approach was not going to be any different than it has been in the past, that our improved leverage and coverage outlook will be taken into account in the future dividend discussions. And I hope what everybody heard was, EBITDA is increasing. It’s very visible that it’s an increase and when we are talking about that in 2019. We will have significantly improved leverage and significantly improved coverage to discuss with our board. And we will be looking for the best use of that higher coverage to most effectively provide for our shareholders. And yes, we will take into account other market-driven approaches to pay out what other companies have done in the market and what the market’s reaction is, but our signal is we are playing this game the way we played in the past. I said it would be a very appropriate assumption to assume that our $0.91 per common share dividend per quarter would be what we were recommending in 2018, all other things being equal. And I said that it gets increasingly attractive after 2018. If you look at our projected long-term outlook and performance and the drivers behind that performance and in fact I was telling you that since June, we feel better about that long-term outlook than we did in June. Does that help?
Vikram Bagri: Understood, yes. The second question I have is about the Downstream Business, excluding the impact of Harvey, it seems like frac business had sort of a record quarter. And as you mentioned, fractionation expansion is more likely now. I was wondering what – given the visibility into growth in volumes, what keeps you from expanding – announcing the expansion on frac? And once you announce frac, I believe your capital program will get closer to $2 billion. So, would you look to fund a portion of that through a preferred – perpetual preferred sort of a security given the gap in cost of capital between preferreds and commons or how would you look to fund the equity portion?
Joe Bob Perkins: First of all, let’s have Scott describe how he is thinking about the fractionation. Then I will come back to the funding.
Scott Pryor: We certainly characterize that we believe at least from the perspective of third quarter to fourth quarter that volumes will be up on the fractionation side of our business from third quarter to fourth quarter and with the continued growth that we see on our upstream business, feeding in from our G&P side and as well as success that we are having on the third-party front with fractionation agreements, we will continue to see growth in that. We have continued to – continuously characterized that it’s a matter of when, not if, when we will add additional fractionation capacity. And as Joe Bob indicated, when we start looking at capital budgets and we make somewhat references to those when we start trying to lay out what we believe 2018 looks like going forward. So clearly for us, it is just a matter of time before we formalize some activity as it relates to fractionation.
Joe Bob Perkins: And relative to the funding, I don’t want to mischaracterize your question, but sort of simplifying it. Would we do a preferred, given the parent cost of capital of a preferred versus the parent cost of capital of a common equity, that’s sort of two of the alternatives we mentioned and I don’t think I will get in a debate on this call about what those specific costs of capital are. But believe me, we are thinking about all kinds of alternatives. I believe what we said was that our traditional combination of public debt and public equity is part of the mix. We also said we would consider private capital and continue to consider creative joint ventures and potential sales of portions of our assets, as we have done in the very recent past, as illustrated by the Grand Prix JV. And I said, only because the incoming is pretty high, that there is a lot of appetite for private capital to participate in the Targa story. So, we will look at all of those various options and alternatives and recognize it maybe for a specific project, like the JV was for Grand Prix, or a discrete set of projects. And when we are thinking about our whole capital funding needs, it kind of becomes more homogenous. It’s not this dollar for this project. We do believe that the 2018 capital lift of some portion of that $1.6 billion or more than $1.6 billion is very manageable, given the alternative sources of capital that we’ve got and our access to the public market and we continue to demonstrate that.
Vikram Bagri: Understood. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Darren Horowitz from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Darren Horowitz: Joe Bob on Grand Prix, just based on the 800 million cubic foot a day of processing capacity that you guys are adding and your math about what that translates to in terms of white grade plus EagleClaw’s dedication growth and how that builds over time. How much more confident today are you that Grand Prix gets expanded up to 550 versus 6 months ago and what would be the incremental CapEx to get it up there?
Joe Bob Perkins: I congratulate you on the new ask of the question on what our volumes are going to be.
Darren Horowitz: It’s my job.
Joe Bob Perkins: It made me smile. I have been careful not to create a volume ramp there and the nominal 300 million a day – 300,000 barrels a day, which doesn’t require a whole lot of pumping, it doesn’t require much capital to go above that. That’s a high class problem. Our outlook, you mentioned EagleClaw, that’s more back-end loaded. It’s not very near-term loaded. And some of the Targa volumes take time to be moved from one pipe to the Targa pipe. We are very comfortable with the ramp. We haven’t defined it for investors. We defined it as a return that’s attractive. And with very high visibility to that attractive return. And each incremental deal we get done just makes it that much better. We are not ordering additional pump shift. That’s probably the best that I can say, but by the way, there is not a shortage of them.
Jennifer Kneale: And that’s really all it takes is just additional pumps.
Darren Horowitz: Okay. Thank you.
Jennifer Kneale: Thanks, Darren.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Blum: Thank you. Good morning. Just, I guess, one question just on leverage in light of your comments about kind of tilting the debt equity funding back a little more towards debt versus over-equitizing in ‘17. I think we all understand the way you are versus your covenant, but you had in the last I guess few quarters talked about a goal of reducing your consolidated leverage over time. And so I just want to get your view of kind of where that stands vis-à-vis your comments about tilting more towards debt? Thanks.
Joe Bob Perkins: And I appreciate the questions, because I would not want the comment to say, I don’t have a longer term goal of moving the consolidated leverage more to that 3x to 4x. We did, but it is a longer term goal. And the time to be moving that consolidated leverage to 3x to 4x is not during that time of rapid EBITDA build. It’s after we get some of that rapid EBITDA build, it will become natural. So in terms of the funding lift, that’s completing projects that bring the EBITDA. I would say that, that consolidated goal is outside of that strong initial ramp and it’s not part of my 2018 plan.
Jennifer Kneale: Yes, right now, Michael, we are about 4.4x on a consolidated basis. And as the growth projects that are underway come online, we would sort of naturally get into that 3x to 4x if nothing else changed.
Michael Blum: Okay, understood. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colton Bean from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Colton Bean: Just a quick one to clarify the – I guess, clarify the comments on the financing plans. I think you mentioned the possibility of some farm-ins. Is that the thinking more along the lines of CapEx projects or potentially existing assets as well?
Joe Bob Perkins: If I said the word farm-ins, I did not intend to. Sometimes I don’t speak clearly. I spoke of the potential appetite of private capital. I spoke of potentially doing joint ventures like we did for Grand Prix. I spoke of lots of incoming and therefore we are paying attention to it. I don’t recall something that was how I would define a farm-in. In the E&P world, a farm-in means that someone is coming into your assets, your properties, being the operator and working to earn an interest. I was not meaning to imply that.
Colton Bean: Yes, that maybe a poor choice of wording there, but more so the question around buying an interest in existing assets versus exclusively growth projects?
Joe Bob Perkins: I think it’s a broad category, the one – the only one I can point to is where primarily growth projects, we have done a recent JV with Sanchez, we’ve got a JV in the Grand Prix pipeline, we’re doing a JV for the GCX project. It’s possible you could have a similar kind of venture in and around an existing asset, or the utilization of an existing asset. To some extent, that’s what we did in South Texas.
Colton Bean: Right, got it. I guess one follow-up to – so pretty strong volume performance across the G&P system. Specifically thinking on the Mid-Con assets here, the legacy system, probably say is not in the prime positioning to capture some of the volume growth that we are seeing and yet the volumes are consistently showing up. Can you guys just touch on, I mean, without getting into too much competitive detail, what the commercial efforts are there and how you are securing volumes to your system?
Joe Bob Perkins: You were pointing to the Mid-Con piece?
Colton Bean: Yes, thinking SouthOK, WestOK.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes. Let’s talk about Oklahoma broadly, both for the SCOOP and the STACK and sort of clarifying the question, I think Pat has got a handle on that one. All I would say is I really, really like it. Go ahead.
Pat McDonie: Right. And you are right we are seeing growth on what we call the Cardinal system, the old Cardinal system. We are seeing pretty good significant volume growth on that system and then growth in the SCOOP. We mentioned in our prepared comments we had built a 24-inch pipeline that was bringing on a lot of incremental SCOOP volumes and it has and those volumes are flowing. And it also was a component of positioning for a long-term acreage dedication that will get developed over time in the SCOOP that brings us some longer-term vision relative to volume growth on the Southern Oklahoma system. So we feel good about where we are at and the commercial efforts and what should develop over time on the SouthOK side of Oklahoma. On the Western Oklahoma side, we’ve also had really good commercial success. Certainly, the historic Mississippi line and the rate of growth that we had over several years when those assets were part of Atlas is not what we’re seeing now. But the Meramec and the development south and east and west of our – the western side of our WestOK system, we’ve been very successful in adding a lot of acreage dedication. And we are getting a higher activity level on that acreage. And where we have seen a decline in volumes across WestOK and we did for the calendar year ‘17, we will. In ‘18, I’m not going to tell you that we’re going to grow, but certainly, we have stemmed the tide. And we see opportunity with the expected drilling level that has been talked with us about by our producers who we’re very close with, that there is opportunity for good volumes added to that WestOK system.
Joe Bob Perkins: I want to add a visual for everybody. When you take the legacy systems and you plot them against the map like the Mississippi line, you say, that’s not where it’s hot. The new pipe has been edging into where it’s high into the Meramec, etcetera. Same thing is happening in SouthOK moving to the north. That extension of pipe is accessing the hot area gas. Now, we can’t get to all of it, but we are getting to some of it. That brings it back to our existing processing plants. Frankly, we are redeploying compression where it’s not needed in a declining area and picking it up and moving it to where it’s needed in a growing area. It’s a redeployment that just makes me smile and SouthOK going from declining to now positive, which is the net of the legacy assets, it’s not a plan, it’s not a goal, but boy it would be good if we got WestOK to do that also, maybe in 2018, maybe in 2019.
Colton Bean: That’s helpful color. Appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Charles Barber: Hey, this is Charlie in for Jeremy. Thanks for taking my call. Just back to Gulf Coast investment, just I guess another way to look at it is the kind of net proceeds from Grand Prix and investment in Gulf Coast. What’s the net number there? Is that zero, positive, negative?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, that is another way to think about it. It’s not how we are thinking about it. Kinder Morgan has not described the cost of the GCX project, to my knowledge. And as I read their transcripts, I think they said it was somewhere between $1 billion and $2 billion and we have got 25% of that. The cost savings in our Grand Prix pipeline are meaningful to us. They are not of dissimilar magnitudes, I guess if you were trying to link the two together, but the strategic decisions are completely independent. We did what we said we would do on our Grand Prix pipeline, which is to maintain our strategic benefits, enhance the economics and de-risk it. It’s just the perfect thing to do. And we are doing what we need to do on the residue side, which is to get access or target in our customers from the Permian Basin to Gulf Coast markets and believe this is the best project to do it with and we like having aligning equity participation with our other partners. That’s how it works out. Net-net, it’s relative to some capital dollars, one went down and one went up, that’s kind of good thing overall relative to our financing needs, but we weren’t trying to match the two.
Charles Barber: Okay. I guess, just two quick questions. The $40 million of cash from Noble, did you get that – did you get that payment for this quarter yet?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes.
Jennifer Kneale: Yes, we did.
Charles Barber: Okay, great. And then just lastly just any commentary on – and I apologize if I missed it, but just kind of looking at general ethane rejection levels relative to last quarter and kind of what you are seeing so far this quarter?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes. We actually look at ethane level graphs and that certainly moved all over the place. You know it was just the hurricane that we had enormous ethane rejection as a function of operational needs and requirements. And now it’s at relatively high levels for the – incoming to our facilities combined. And that was over a very short period of time. Every operator has the ability to turn those knobs on a weekly, if not daily, basis. And we sort of catch the result of that. I believe there is a trend. I believe there is a trend towards us receiving a higher and higher percentage of ethane as a part of the stream. That’s a natural economic trend. That trend is somewhat times distorted by economic decisions that have to do with some costs and every individual player can be in a different position and we received the aggregate amount of that.
Scott Pryor: Yes. The only thing that I would to that, Joe Bob is just somewhat paraphrasing, the trend is moving upwards, albeit you might see distinctions from day-to-day a little bit different, up, down. But again, when you point to the expansion growth that we’re seeing on the petrochemical side of our business, you would expect that trend to continue, albeit we will see increased production during those same time frames. So we are seeing from day-to-day different types of anomalies in the marketplace as it relates to ethane recovery, but in general, the trend is moving with more increased recovery.
Charles Barber: I guess one more on to that. I know that you have ethane, propane feedstock agreement that will start with one of your customers that should be starting up their plant this quarter. Are conversations about additional back-end capacity are those happening with any of the plants that are coming on between ’18-19 or are the conversations more so further dated or any of the second wave of crackers?
Scott Pryor: No, there are continuous conversations going on with all of the petrochemical expansions that are going on. We obviously have a significant connectability to existing plants. As plants are expanding, they are looking to upsize their capacities into the facilities to ramp up over time relative to what the demands look like. You would expect as a result of Hurricane Harvey that some of those expansions might be slightly delayed, but overall, increase connectability or enhanced connectability is happening. We allude to that when we talk about some of our CapEx spending that we are doing some things on the downstream side to enhance those types of deliveries.
Charles Barber: Alright, great. Thank you for the color.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Danilo Juvane from BMO Capital. Your line is open.
Danilo Juvane: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Just as a follow-up on the conversation around a potential incremental frac facility, just want to understand the utilization as I see it is still roughly 75% in Mont Belvieu, maybe low 60s overall. Is the need for an incremental frac facility imminent or is this something that we are thinking about doing over the next 2 to 3 years?
Joe Bob Perkins: I would say that it is highly likely that fractionation expansion will happen in and around our assets and that it is just highly likely. Again, restating what we have continuously said and that it’s a matter of when, not if. But again, certainly when you look at the growth that we have got with our own assets on the G&P side and the increased production across the Permian and other areas, we will see fractionation expansion happening.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes. On the fractionation utilization number you are looking at is a little bit of a rearview mirror. We gave you – you may not have done the calculation yet, but we gave you what the normalized fractionation would have been in the third quarter without the impact of Hurricane Harvey. Those kind of quarter-to-quarter increases – and they’re not magic. They are coming from the Permian primarily and other basins that are growing create or increase the utilization fairly quickly.
Danilo Juvane: Fair enough. I appreciate that. And secondly, Joe Bob and maybe Jen can chime in as well just it looks like 2018 growth CapEx maybe north of $1.6 billion. And I am thinking about I guess bringing the conversation back to funding, does it make sense, Joe Bob, to maybe revisit a potentially rebasing the dividend keeping the debt metrics where they are and lessen the need for equity next year just given how people are migrating towards more of a self-funding model?
Joe Bob Perkins: There has not been a lot of migration to a self-funding model. I was trying to remember, I think you are around that dinner a couple of years ago at the Wells Fargo conference, right after Kinder who wasn’t there reduce their dividend. I’ve had some of the same investors giving me both sides of what to do with the dividend since then. Our discussion today was supposed to be clear that whereas in the long-term future, we’ll look at what to do with the higher coverage, lower leverage. And yes, we will be paying attention to what other market-driven volumes are, that we do not have an intention or that it will not be a better assumption for 2018 to assume that we were still recommending the $0.91. Financial theory says you might slightly modify or optimize the cost of your capital by funding less with the dividend. At the same time, our attention is primarily on the projects, which are well above the cost of capital for a model that included this dividend, a slightly higher dividend or a slightly lower dividend. And that’s what our focus is on. I also believe that in this space, the impact of a decreased dividend cut has an amplifier that we certainly aren’t looking to baying on. We have maintained the $0.91 dividend since 2015 and I forgot the month, third quarter of 2015. Through some much more difficult times than we are currently in. For Targa, we believe that it is the right answer.
Danilo Juvane: I appreciate that. Those are my questions. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back to the presenters.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you very much, operator. If you should have any other questions, please feel to reach out to Sanjay, Jen or any of us. We appreciate your time and attention today. Go Astros.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.

Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Sanjay. Good morning, and thanks to everyone for joining. I’m going to start with an update on Targa’s strategic initiatives underway -- initiatives underway which are positioning us for longer-term EBITDA growth. It was another busy quarter for Targa employees, with our day-to-day business activities augmented by progress on a number of impactful initiatives. For example, we continued the integration of our Permian assets acquired on March 1 and had the first full quarter of operating and improving those assets. We brought on growing volumes across our strong Midland and Delaware Basin positioning. Our 200 million cubic feet per day Raptor plant in South Texas came online. We made an acquisition of Boardwalk Pipeline Partners’ Flag City assets and contracts in South Texas, and then immediately integrated those volumes into our existing facilities. We continued progress on adding 710 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity in the Permian Basin, which will bring us to a total of approximately 2.5 billion cubic feet per day of gross processing capacity across the basin by next year. And Targa announced our Grand Prix pipeline, a $1.3 billion, 300,000 barrel per day on initial capacity, common carrier NGL pipeline from the Permian Basin to Mont Belvieu. Let’s discuss Grand Prix in a little more detail. Grant Prix will connect our strong and growing franchise Permian Basin footprint to our downstream assets at Mont Belvieu. Our processing footprint translates into Targa moving significant daily volumes of NGLs out of the Permian with good visibility on substantial growth in the future. For Targa, Grand Prix enhances our positioning by bolstering our premier midstream gathering and processing position in the Permian Basin with a secure and reliable takeaway solution connected to our premier downstream footprint, by enhancing a highly competitive, fully integrated service offering to our current and future customers, and leveraging each piece of the Targa value chain. And Grand Prix enhances our positioning by providing significant and increasingly fee-based earnings over the longer term, increasingly paying ourselves for NGL transport instead of renting it from others and helping to direct incremental volumes to our downstream facilities. Grand Prix is expected to be operational in the second quarter of 2019 and we will begin to move significant NGL volumes to Grand Prix on day one. NGL volumes from additional Targa processing plants in progress or those needed in the future will flow to Grand Prix, which will provide significant margin expansion and fee-based growth looking forward. We’ll also move volumes to Grand Prix over time as our existing third party NGL obligations expire, providing visibility on growth into the future. We announced and are proceeding with a stand-alone project because we have visibility on the volumes on Grand Prix that will provide us with an attractive return and significant strategic value. And because we often get the question, we will repeat what we have stated publicly before, which is that our Permian Basin position and the aggregated NGL volumes associated with it are very attractive to our stand-alone project and to potential partnering opportunities. Of course, we remain open to potential partner opportunities that would enhance our economics on the project while retaining the strategic benefits. On our first quarter conference call we announced that we were moving forward with construction of an incremental 450 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity in the Permian Basin. That newly announced capacity is from the Johnson and Wildcat plants, one in the Midland Basin and one in the Delaware Basin, and they are in addition to the 260 million cubic feet per day of new plant capacity that was already well underway before we announced them. By the third quarter of 2018, we will have approximately 2.5 billion cubic feet per day of gross processing capacity in the Permian Basin, positioning us to continue to capture producer volumes on our dedicated acreage and to successfully compete for additional opportunities. Including the spending associated with Grand Prix, approximately 80% of Targa’s current capital spending is related to the Permian, highlighting that Targa’s attractive investment opportunities are being primary driven by volumes from arguably the most prolific basin in the world. We believe that the combination of our legacy Permian systems, combined with new plants, our newly acquired assets in the Delaware and Midland Basin and a Permian NGL takeaway solution in the form of Grand Prix is a platform for sustainable, long term Targa growth. In late June we published an investor presentation outlining some of Targa’s longer term financial expectations. The purpose of providing more of a long term view, a long term outlook, of our expectations was to highlight that we believe we have strong visibility into significant EBITDA growth between now and 2021 even if we are in an environment with crude, NGL and natural gas prices around today’s levels. We estimated in that outlook that adjusted EBITDA will increase from our approximately $1.13 billion in 2017 to approximately $1.5 billion in 2019 and approximately $2 billion in 2021. We also believe that there is more upside than downside to our longer-term financial outlook. Because, for example, we only included LPG export volumes that are already contracted, and we only included estimated volumes available from acreage already dedicated to Targa using recent historical type curves and recovery assumptions without continued improvements in completion performance. Of course, despite those outlook assumptions, our commercial teams in both the Gathering and Processing segment and the Downstream segment continue to work on a number of very interesting and attractive contracts and projects, and we certainly expect that others will be identified over the forecast period, none of which are included in our expectations. With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt to discuss Targa’s results for the second quarter.
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Joe Bob. Targa’s reported adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $258 million, which is comparable to the same period in 2016. Continued strong volume growth in Permian G&P, higher commodity prices and higher fractionation volumes were offset by lower volumes in our other G&P regions and lower margins in our Downstream Business. Reported net maintenance CapEx were $23 million in the second quarter of 2017, compared to $19 million in the second quarter of 2016. We continue to estimate approximately $110 million of net maintenance CapEx for 2017. Distributable cash flow for the second quarter was approximately $196 million, resulting in dividend coverage of approximately 0.9x. Given some seasonality in our Downstream businesses, we expect the second quarter to be the weakest quarter of the year and expect our operating margin to ramp up in the second half of the year. For full year 2017, as Joe Bob mentioned, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $1.13 billion and full year 2017 dividend coverage to be between 0.95 and 1.0x. Also, I would like to point out that during the second quarter we benefited from a cash tax addback to distributable cash flow of approximately $31 million that includes an adjustment reflecting the benefit from a net operating loss carryback to 2014 and ‘15. Previously, we expected to collect the remaining refund on or before the fourth quarter of this year, but received the entirety of the remaining refund during the second quarter and recognized it in DCF. Turning to our segment-level results for our Gathering and Processing segment, reported operating margin for the second quarter of 2017 increased by 25% compared to last year, primarily due to higher commodity prices and higher inlet volumes in the Permian Basin despite lower Field G&P inlet volumes in other areas. Natural gas prices were 65% higher; NGL prices, 28% higher; condensate prices were 13% higher when compared to the second quarter of 2016. Second quarter reported 2017 field natural gas plant inlet volumes were approximately 2% higher when compared to the second quarter of 2016. Permian inlet volumes reported in the second quarter of 2017 were 18% higher when compared to the prior year, with increases in both Permian Midland and Permian Delaware. As a reminder, volumes from our recently acquired Delaware assets are reported as part of Sand Hills and volumes from our recently acquired Midland assets are reported in SAOU. Year-over-year second quarter inlet volume decreases in South Texas, North Texas and WestOK partially offset the overall increase in Field G&P natural gas inlet volumes. You may recall that in the second quarter of 2016 our South Texas volumes increased significantly as we benefited from some interruptible low margin volumes. Now moving to our sequential second quarter 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2017 results, Permian inlet volumes grew 9.5%, partially driven by a full quarter of volumes from our newly acquired Permian assets and growth in our Permian Midland systems. Inlet volumes in South Texas were sequentially higher as a result of volumes from the acquisition of Boardwalk’s Flag City assets and fee-based contracts and higher volumes from Sanchez on the system as wells that were shut in during the first quarter for nearby well fracking returned to production. Volumes also increased sequentially in SouthOK as we continued to benefit from incremental SCOOP volumes on our system that were more than sufficient to offset legacy production declines. Now let’s discuss our results compared to our previously disclosed volume guidance. First half 2017 Permian inlet volumes, as reported, were 14% higher than 2016 as compared to our expectations of 15% growth. Overall, Field G&P system inlet volumes were flat versus 2016, consistent with our expectations. Looking forward, we expect inlet volume growth in the Permian, South Texas, SouthOK and the Badlands to continue in the second half of 2017, providing us with momentum in 2018. While we are only one month into the quarter, our July inlet volumes for overall Field G&P, driven by the Permian, South Texas, SouthOK and Badlands are all meaningfully higher than our second quarter average Field G&P volumes. For example, our recent volumes were up significantly through July. On an as-reported basis, WestTX volumes were over 600 million cubic feet per day at the end of July versus the second quarter average of 542 million cubic feet per day. Badlands July volumes were approximately 30% higher than the second quarter average, and South Texas volumes at the end of July were approximately -- or were higher by approximately 40%. And SouthOK volumes were also showing a solid uptick. While it is early in the third quarter, the positive volume trends are in line with our second half volume ramp expectations and we remain on track to meet our full year 2017 field and Permian volume expectations provided earlier this year. The trajectory also provides a positive outlook for the beginning of 2018. Now shifting to the Bakken, Badlands crude oil gathered volumes were approximately 113,000 barrels per day for the second quarter, up approximately 7% versus same time period last year. Second quarter natural gas volumes increased 2% when compared to the prior year and, more notably, increased 14% over the first quarter as weather conditions normalized and producer activity around our system continued. As I mentioned earlier, we are already seeing a nice increase in July volumes in the Badlands and we continue to expect that average 2017 natural gas and crude volumes will exceed average 2016. Permian crude gathered in the second quarter were approximately 29,000 barrels per day as we benefited from a full quarter of our recent Permian acquisition. In our Downstream segment, second quarter reported operating margin declined 21% over the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to lower LPG export margin and lower margin from our domestic marketing and commercial transportation businesses, partially offset by higher fractionation margin. Sequentially, fractionation volumes increased 11% over the first quarter due to increased supply, largely driven by higher volumes from our Permian systems. In our LPG export business, we exported approximately 4.7 million barrels per month of propane and butane and received fees from 2 cancellations at our facility during the quarter. Moving to capital spending, we expect 2017 net growth capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion based on announced projects. The $165 million increase in our 2017 estimated capital spend compared to our previous estimate is attributable to a shift in timing of spending for Grand Prix from 2018 to 2017, additional Permian spending in both the Midland and Delaware Basins, and a shift in timing of spend of the Johnson plant some from ‘18 to 2017. Our total expected cost for Grand Prix continues to be approximately $1.3 billion and we currently estimate $330 million of that in 2017 and the majority of the balance of the spending in 2018. Grand Prix is expected to be fully operational in the second quarter of 2019. Our growth capital related to the Permian increased for the year due to additional infrastructure, primarily in the Delaware, as we build out the system for future growth. The additional capital is primarily related to shifting additional infrastructure buildout spending into 2017 from future periods without increasing total expected costs of the projects. Now let’s discuss our capital structure and liquidity. As of June 30 we had no borrowings outstanding under TRP’s $1.6 billion senior secured revolving credit facility, due October 2020. On a debt compliance basis, TRP’s leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was 3.4x versus a compliance covenant of 5.5x. We also had borrowings of $250 million under our accounts receivable securitization facility. As of June 30, TRC had $435 million in borrowings outstanding under our $670 million senior secured credit facility and availability at quarter-end was approximately $235 million. Including about $99 million in cash, our total available liquidity at the end of the second quarter was approximately $1.9 billion. During the second quarter, we raised approximately $880 million of public equity from a 17 million common share secondary offering and our ATM program. Proceeds from our 17 million share secondary offering in June are expected to fund the equity component of our Grand Prix project in addition to satisfying our remaining equity requirements for our current 2017 net growth CapEx program. We also have expected spending in April 2018 and April 2019 related to the earnout payments associated with our March 1 Permian acquisition. Given the volume ramp on our acquired Permian asset has been slower than expected over the first five months that we have owned the asset, our current expectation is for a modest earnout payment in April 2018. For 2018 and beyond, with longer-term expectations positive relative to our preannouncement forecast, we continue to forecast significant growth on those acquired assets and expect to pay a more sizeable final earnout payment in April 2019. In our corporate hedging program we executed additional hedges during the second quarter. We added some balance of the year 2017 through 2019 natural gas and NGL swaps. Pro forma, as of June 30, 2017, for non-fee-based operating margin, relative to the partnership’s current estimate of equity volumes from our Field G&P segment, for 2017 we estimate we’ve hedged approximately 85% of natural gas, 70% of condensate and 60% of NGL volume. For 2018, we estimate we’ve hedged approximately 60% of natural gas, 50% of condensate and 30% of NGL volumes. I will now turn the call over to Pat, who leads our Southern Field G&P business. Pat?
Patrick McDonie: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. As Joe Bob mentioned, it was a busy second quarter in the Gathering and Processing segment -- busy in a good way. And as Matt mentioned, if the first month of the third quarter is any indication, that trend will continue for the foreseeable future. We are focused on continuing to add infrastructure around our newly acquired Permian assets, particularly in the Delaware, where those assets have now been integrated into our Sand Hills system and where we are working hard to keep pace with our producers. In addition to adding gathering lines, compression and treating capabilities, we are continuing construction on our 60 million cubic feet per day Oahu gas processing plant, expected online early in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the 250 million cubic feet per day Wildcat gas processing plant, which is now expected online in the second quarter of 2018. We are also connecting our Versado and Sand Hills systems with the new Delaware assets, which we expect to be completed in the fourth quarter. This interconnectivity across the entire Permian Basin will benefit our customers with increased system flexibility, reliability and optionality, supporting our continued efforts to provide best-in-class services to our producer. In the Permian Midland, customer activity around our WestTX, SAOU and newly acquired systems continues. During the second quarter we restarted the 45 million cubic feet per day Benedum plant and completed the 20 million cubic feet per day expansion at the Midkiff plant. While these are relatively small projects, they provided much needed relief to our WestTX system as were able to shift rapidly increasing volumes around, which enabled us to operate the overall system more efficiently while awaiting the next plant. The next plant in West Texas, the much needed 200 million-cubic-feet-per-day Joyce plant, is on track to begin service in the first quarter of 2018, and the 200 million cubic feet per day Johnson plant is expected to begin service shortly thereafter in the third quarter of 2018. Given our expectations and daily realization of volume growth at WestTX, the in service dates of these additional plants are timely, as the remainder of the system will be largely full, with good visibility on continued volume. As noted earlier, we have seen an increase in volume since the second quarter ended, and we expect this trend to remain in place through the balance of the year, resulting in continued volume growth and positive momentum heading into 2018. Importantly, we also believe that with the addition of the Grand Prix NGL pipeline and the resulting ability for us to offer our existing and future customers a fully integrated Targa suite of services, we will be able to incredibly grow our Gathering and Processing business.  Our G&P and Downstream commercial teams are working extremely well together to jointly provide producers with creative, efficient and attractive service offerings, and are supported by exceptional engineering and operational teams focused on delivering creative and reliable solutions. The combination of the resource potential of the 2-million-plus acres dedicated to us in the Midland and Delaware Basins with Targa’s integrated assets and our commercial operational and engineering capabilities really positions us well for significant volume growth from our G&P segment, and consequently NGL volume growth on Grand Prix. Moving to our Oklahoma assets, our outlook continues to strengthen as we benefit from continued commercial success and producer activity on our dedicated acreage. Second quarter inlet volumes for SouthOK were approximately 9% higher than the first quarter, and we expect that trend to continue in the second half of 2017 as we finish construction on our line that will bring additional SCOOP volumes to our system. In SouthTX, system inlet volumes sharply increased 30% sequentially over the first quarter from a couple of catalysts. First, our acquisition of Boardwalk’s underutilized 150 million cubic feet per day Flag City plant and associated assets, that include fee based contracts for $60 million; and soon after the acquisition, we shifted producer volumes previously being processed at the Flag City plant to our Silver Oak facilities for processing. We are decommissioning the Flag City plant and expect to move the plant and the other acquired assets for use elsewhere in the Targa G&P business. While this was a relatively small acquisition, it was an opportunity to take advantage of our relatively strong position to rationalize excess capacity in the Eagle Ford and acquire attractive fee-based contracts and additional assets at a low multiple. Second, we also benefited from additional volumes as production resumed from wells that had been shut in for nearby well fracking. Additionally, our new 200 million cubic feet per day Raptor plant began flowing gas in late May and we shifted volumes from our Silver Oak facilities to Raptor. The 60 million cubic feet per day expansion of the Raptor plant is expected to be completed in September and we continue to work closely with our JV partner on additional Eagle Ford opportunities. Overall, in SouthTX, we continue to expect higher 2017 volumes versus the average 2016. To echo what Matt described in his remarks, the first half presented some unexpected pluses and minuses across the Gathering and Processing segment, but our long-term expectations remain on track and extremely positive. For 2017, we expect average Field G&P inlet volumes to be 10% higher than 2016, driven by year-over-year inlet volume growth of 20% in the Permian Basin and higher year-over-year volumes in SouthTX, SouthOK and the Badlands. I will now turn the call over to Scott Pryor, who leads our Downstream Business. Scott?
Scott Pryor: Thanks, Pat. Our second quarter results in the Downstream segment were consistent with our expectations that seasonality in some business areas would result in quarterly operating margin being the lowest for the year. As we look forward into the second half of 2017 and beyond, I want to reiterate Joe Bob’s statement, that there is upside potential in some of our key Downstream areas. Our sequential increase in fractionation volumes was largely driven by higher field G&P inlet volumes, which we expect to continue, resulting in increasing NGL volumes downstream. Ethane extraction is expected to increase, and over time this will drive higher fractionation volumes for Targa, and needed supply to feed a growing petrochemical demand. By the end of 2017 we expect an increase of 150,000 barrels per day of new ethane demand, driven by new ethylene crackers coming online along the U.S. Gulf Coast and, in 2018, another 300,000 barrels per day of new ethane demand from additional new ethylene crackers coming online. Importantly, the vast majority of announced ethylene cracker expansions and new builds that should be online by 2020 are located along the Gulf Coast. These facilities will not only increase the demand for purity products around our fractionation assets to use as feedstock, but will also draw Y-grade volumes to Mont Belvieu, also benefiting our Downstream Business. We continue to add or expand connections to existing, expanding and new petrochemical crackers, leveraging our premier NGL hub location to increase our access to growing demand. As mentioned earlier, we moved a reduced amount of short-term LPG export volumes in the second quarter and received fees from two vessel cancellations. Global LPG market dynamics for the second quarter were similar to second quarter 2016, when we also experienced lower demand after coming off a period of higher demand in the fourth and first quarters of 2016. We loaded 4.7 million barrels per month of LPGs for the quarter, which was consistent with the assumption made in June when we provided additional financial expectations for 2017 and beyond. As we think about the balance of 2017 and our published outlook for adjusted EBITDA through 2021, let me reiterate that for those published perspectives we will -- we are assuming no short-term LPG exports over the forecasted period. It is my expectation, however, that we will significantly outperform those export assumptions over the outlook period, as the team continues to work very hard globally to add incremental short- and long-term contracts to our portfolio. Looking forward, our outlook for LPG export business is unchanged given our substantial long-term contract position and favorable long-term global fundamentals for U.S. LPG exports, driven by continued global demand growth and the U.S.’s position as the likely supplier to feed that demand growth. Finally, the addition of Grand Prix really is a game-changer for our Downstream Business. Even as one of the largest daily shippers of NGLs out of the Permian Basin, we have historically had to pay third parties to move those volumes on our behalf. Grand Prix removes that leakage, provides fee-based cash flow and fully integrates Targa’s G&P assets with our downstream footprint, which further enhances our competitive capabilities to move volumes from the wellhead through the entire NGL value chain. The volumes that Targa manages at the tailgate of our current and future processing plants are substantial, and we have also secured third party commitments on Grand Prix that will result in incremental volumes on day 1 of operations in the second quarter of 2019. There are tremendous demand growth drivers on the U.S. Gulf Coast from export facilities moving products to global markets and petrochemical crackers which will create additional demand for liquids production upstream of Grand Prix. As the expected volumes flowing through Grand Prix increase over time, we expect significant fee-based cash flow from the asset, which ultimately should drive returns for the project to between 5 to 7x CapEx as a multiple of EBITDA, and potentially lower, depending on continued commercial success and pace of volume growth. Overall, the outlook for Targa’s Downstream Business remains highly robust, driven by the continued integration with our growing G&P business and the flow of NGLs to our strong asset position along the U.S. Gulf Coast. And with that, I’ll turn the call back over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Scott. While our second quarter financial performance is expected to be the lowest quarter for the current year, we are confident in the continued second half 2017 acceleration in Permian volume growth complemented by increasing supply being directed to our Downstream businesses. We are on track to meet or exceed our full year 2017 operational and financial expectations and, importantly, are very well positioned for the longer term. I hope you made note of the July volumes updated by Matt. They’re providing significant growth from Q2 averages. Those impressive volumes certainly validate our expectations for the second half and how well we feel we are positioned for the longer term. Our longer-term outlook beyond 2017 continues to strengthen as our visibility around volumes and projects supports our expectation for significant margin expansion for our G&P segment in 2018 and beyond, and that is complemented by the addition of the Grand Prix NGL pipeline and by other opportunities in our Downstream Business. Our strong liquidity position and demonstrated access to the capital markets positions us well as we execute on our projects underway. Our commitment to maintaining the strength of our balance sheet to preserve Targa’s financial flexibility remains steadfast, as evidenced by the equity that we raised during the second quarter. Our team at Targa remains focused on continuing to execute on our strategic objectives, and we are excited about Targa’s strong long-term outlook. Thank you for your patience. There’s a lot going on and a lot that we wanted to update you about. So with that, operator, please open the line to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of T.J. Schultz from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
T.J. Schultz: First -- so, Pioneer talked about the higher gas-oil ratios, so more gas, and I appreciate the look at volumes in July. Can you just discuss if this higher GOR is additive to what you had expected with your volume original guidance, and the impact it may have on your pace of projects out there?
Joe Bob Perkins: Higher GOR, I believe has been mentioned -- in the Permian, has been mentioned in our prior calls. It’s a trend we see really across both the Midland and our presence in the Delaware. And I won’t try to further describe Pioneer’s comments. We work closely with them and are aware of those trends. We are trying primarily to help with the gas and that higher GOR, which was described in their call, has already been worked into our expectations. Now we aren’t exactly precise and sometimes get surprised by upsides on GOR and numbers of wells, but it’s certainly within our outlook tolerance and conservatism.
T.J. Schultz: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, on Grand Prix, first, just any update or response to third party volumes so far? And then, as you consider JVs, is there an advantage in your mind one way or the other as you look to combine maybe with other midstream or similar projects versus going a different route by bringing in a producer equity partner for more commitment?
Joe Bob Perkins: On the first part of that, we described the positive response to the announcement, though people in the industry were beginning to suspect that we had that project underway. And yes, we have added commitments since that announcement. We obviously were having those discussions beforehand. It’s now a real project. Secondly, in reference to potential ventures or agreements that would enhance it, there are a number of kinds. You picked on a couple of them. And we are interested in opportunities that improve our economics while retaining the strategic benefits of a Targa line. And if we meet those criteria, you could do either of those two, both of those two or something else. Economics and strategic benefit is what our criteria are.
T.J. Schultz: Got it. Thanks. And just lastly, so Enterprise announced the potential for an ethylene export facility through a JV with Navigator. You all already export ethylene. What are your options or your interest to expand ethylene exports, and are there any limitations as it relates to vessel availability?
Joe Bob Perkins: I’m going to answer the very last part first and then come back to your first part, T.J. Vessel availability on any export product is sort of a come and go. They can build them pretty quickly. And some of the vessels that used to be used for ethylene are being used for propane. But over a medium time frame, vessels can be added. Relative to our interest, we are the only export facility in the U.S. Gulf Coast right now with our partner CPC -- our very good partner CPC.  I might interpret that the announcement by Enterprise was saying they’re interested also, and we’re probably talking to many of the same potential customers. If we were doing a press release, I think that Mark Lashier and I would say that if we had sufficient contractual backing to justify additional investment -- which would be incremental for us, because we already have 1 additional investment -- we would probably go forward with such a project as well. And our teams are working on it.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Colton Bean from Tudor Pickering Holt.
Colton Bean: I just wanted to circle up on the Outrigger contribution this quarter. So it looked like, with both SAOU and Sand Hills, pretty big volume ramp Q-over-Q, more than would be implied just for kind of the full quarter of contribution from Outrigger. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on how volumes are progressing there, and maybe versus your expectations earlier in the year.
Matt Meloy: Yes. So the volumes from the Delaware assets from the Outrigger acquisition are included in the Sand Hills, which is a large reason why those volumes are ramping. And then similar on the Midland side, those are included in SAOU and those were a significant piece of that growth as well. We said for this year the volume ramp is a bit slower than our original expectations. We’re building out initial infrastructure, getting to wells, and we’re trying to catch up and keep up with our producers. And we’re doing a good job of that, but it has been a bit slower than our original expectations. But the outlook and the discussions we’ve had with producers really is not impacting our 2018 and beyond outlook for activity in and around those assets. So the long-term value that we see remains intact, and growth out there -- we still see strong on both the Midland side and on the Delaware side.
Joe Bob Perkins: This is Joe Bob. I think it’s a reasonable read through to say the Outrigger -- I said that on the call; I was trying not to. The recent Permian Basin acquisition, while a little bit lower, was already embedded in our previous guidance. Which means everything else is doing a little bit better. And then Matt says that after ‘17 we feel better about the acquisition. That’s all positive relative to our initial discussions at the beginning of the year.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni from UBS.
Shneur Gershuni: Just a couple of questions just, sort of, to follow up on T.J.’s question just with respect to Pioneer and the gassier wells. So just to confirm what your response was, you had already seen that trend and had baked it into your guidance? Because I think that we’re sort of hearing it more from Pioneer for the first time, so that’s why I was trying to understand if there had been a shift there, and then there’s a corresponding positive impact for Targa, or if this has been kind of the expectation the whole time and Pioneer wasn’t really talking about it previously.
Joe Bob Perkins: No. This call is not the call for providing more detail for my good customer and partner, Pioneer. I did say that GOR across the whole basin was a part of our broad outlook, and we had not provided any specific discussions about the Pioneer volumes. So I don’t really have more detail to add to that other than Pioneer has a terrific performance. And Pat’s showing me he wants to say something else about it.
Patrick McDonie: And what you’ve got to realize is, this trend has been based on these longer laterals and the new frack techniques, and it’s really in the early stages of defining what it is and what it becomes. So when we say we have it baked into our numbers, we have adjusted type curves over time as we’ve seen an increase in GOR. We are always very conservative on the type curves that we utilize to predict volume growth across our system with our producers. And I would tell you that the GOR changes that are being talked about and seen are not baked into our numbers.
Joe Bob Perkins: We typically use recent historical -- and I think that was even in our script, recent historical type curves, which for the most part get better and better for Targa over time.
Shneur Gershuni: Just following up, there’s been some comments on a bunch of different calls throughout the earnings season, both midstream and E&P, about completion crude tightness in the basin. My understanding, this has been going on for three to four months. Is it fair to assume that that has been taken into account into your forecast as well, also?
Joe Bob Perkins: I think that if you went back to our -- the prior discussions, we’ve said we see limiting factors -- multiple limiting factors across the Permian Basin, relative to some of the more bullish projections. We talked about staffing for drilling rigs, completion rigs, pumping units. We talked about availability of equipment. I think we’ve described that it wasn’t too long ago, you couldn’t even get a high-pressure, long-lateral walking rig in the Permian. They were all done. So we’re trying to use realistic -- hate to use the word conservative, but informed, because we’re there all the time -- estimates about what sort of activity levels we believe will occur, not month by month and quarter by quarter, but over that multi-year outlook that we’re providing. We’re not getting carried with what those activity levels, completion rigs, pumping unit availability, sand constraints, water constraints might do to impact it to the downside, but we’re also definitely not getting carried away on them all being solved at one time.
Shneur Gershuni: [indiscernible] Fair enough. Yes. No. Absolutely. And just transitioning to Grand Prix for a second, kind of a two part question -- one, how much space do you expect Targa-associated processing plants will take up on the pipeline, I guess as a market share of the pipe itself once it comes online? And then, secondly, when you’re having discussions with others who might be interested in some JV negotiations, is being an operator a must-have, or are you indifferent to being an operator versus a non-operator owner?
Joe Bob Perkins: I understand the desire to have more detail than we put in our scripted remarks, and we also described how we were approaching the pipeline when we first announced it. Market share initially of Targa volumes on the pipe is not something we’ve provided. I believe what we’ve said is, you’ve got attractive returns well below the initial capacity of 300,000 barrels per day, and that additional third party volumes and Targa’s continued growth would increase from our -- what we said were significant volumes, day 1, from Targa-managed volumes and new plants. It’s not ready for a while. And then, as terms of factors like operatorship, et cetera, we said that we wanted to retain strategic benefits, and I don’t really want to describe the elements underneath those strategic benefits. Just kind of broadly summed up of, own it instead of rent it, and then be able to put it into the value chain under our control.
Shneur Gershuni: Okay. Yes. That makes total sense, and I’m sure you understand why I’m asking, but I appreciate the color, guys.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Darren Horowitz from Raymond James.
Darren Horowitz: Joe Bob, I realize it’s early to put numbers around this, so conceptually speaking, when you look at the increased confidence that you guys have on field inlet G&P exiting this year, what you’ve talked about with regard to Permian inlet volumes obviously ramping into ‘18, how much of that for you is increased by more confidence off of the visibility you have in base asset throughput versus this "gassier" phenomenon of wells increasing versus what could be even a shift in well completions as some customers are adding additional casing to deal with some different pressures on shallower reservoirs.
Joe Bob Perkins: You hit a lot of very interesting factors, and each one is difficult to quantify individually. We are working with our trends. Like Pat said a little while ago, really kind of using our rear-view mirror. It’s not the deep rear-view mirror, but recent GORs, recent type curves, in those outlooks. Part of our confidence is, in total, those factors you mentioned relative to when we did the outlook or recognized that we worked on that outlook well before we sort of presented it in June. Yes, our expectations keep going up on almost all factors. And that’s -- we never got to the point of saying exactly how many wells in the Permian. You’re going to see some little ups and downs, and a producer will use a price drop to let go of rigs and then bring them back on. We believe that we had a view of that for multiple years. So I’m not going to try to describe any 1 factor, but it’s hard for me to think of a factor right now that would be a negative to me feeling better about our long-term outlook.
Darren Horowitz: Yes. And then if I could take that a step further, as the back half of the year really starts to get the benefit of field inlet being even more pronounced, specifically in 4Q, what do you think that might do, since it was in your slide deck, to utilization of Targa fractionators? Because obviously we saw a big sequential increase in frack volumes quarter-over-quarter that seems to be even more pronounced in 4Q versus 3Q. Can you give us a sense for what you’re expecting?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes. I think you just -- you kind of just answered it. It’s a pretty significant impact on our frack volumes over time as we follow that outlook. As -- we joked in preparation for this call that you all could probably draw the curve we’ve got driven for the second half. Don’t be drawing it by month. But we’re on track, and we’re going to meet or exceed our previous expectations. And that has a nice downstream benefit. Scott’s smiling.
Darren Horowitz: Okay. And then last one for me. Just, Matt, a quick housekeeping question. On the Outrigger assets, where is the contingent consideration liability right now on the fair value of what you’d expect the earnout on those assets to be?
Matt Meloy: Yes. Sure, Darren. It’s about $417 million, and we’ll have more details on it when the Q gets filed. It should be out later today. We also included in there, in the footnotes, an amount for 2018 and 2019. So right now our estimate for 2018 -- so the first payment is approximately $40 million of that amount, and then the remainder about $377 million in 2019.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Charlie, actually, in for Jeremy. Just first question real quick on logistics and marketing side. Just curious, have you received any revenue for the cancellations during the quarter, just given kind of what seemed like fairly good margins despite kind of the drop in volumes?
Scott Pryor: Yes, Charlie. We indicated both in our prepared remarks and discussions that we’ve had even at investor conference, that we saw during the second quarter two cancellations, and we did receive cancellation fees for those. Looking forward, at this point we’re not seeing cancellations. But again, time will tell relative to the overall global fundamentals that we see out there going forward. I would suggest to you that our belief is, when we look at the second quarter, it was very similar to what we saw in the second quarter of 2016. Somewhat of a trough in relative sense, when you look at the balance of the year. So again, with demand growing across the globe, production increases in the U.S. and the U.S. being really the preeminent supplier for incremental volume growth across the globe, we will be the supplier of that as a U.S. industry, and Targa sits well to benefit from that as well.
Joe Bob Perkins: And Charlie, I haven’t found anyone who wants to take my bet on the over-under of zero exports in our long-term outlook. If you can find someone who wants those bets, I’ve got reserves.
Unidentified Analyst: Just one other real quick one. Just looking at the kind of plant utilizations, and specifically kind of looking at West Texas, I mean, they’re a little bit lower than some of the other Permian plants. Is that just kind of an age factor? I’m just trying to understand what sort -- how hard some of these plants can run given significant ramp-up in volumes in the second half.
Joe Bob Perkins: Charlie, did you say WestTX?
Matt Meloy: Yes.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay.
Matt Meloy: Yes. It’s also related to part of where the gas comes on. We have offloads. We move some volumes to and from Sand Hills; some volumes to and from SAOU. So it’s also just dependent on where those volumes are coming on and where we can push it -- whether we can get the gas up to Buffalo or down to the Edward and Driver. So it’s a pretty integrated system we have with the WestTX, SAOU and even out through Sand Hills. We are adding additional capacity with the additional Benedum and Midkiff coming on in the second quarter -- is going to increase capacity there, and we’ll be moving volumes to those facilities, and I think you’ll start seeing that increase here.
Joe Bob Perkins: And you asked about age of assets. The bulk of that portfolio -- I couldn’t give you a percentage right now -- is fairly new.
Matt Meloy: It’s pretty new, yes.
Patrick McDonie: Yes, but 130 million a day.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you.
Patrick McDonie: The WestTX system assets are very new.
Matt Meloy: Very new, yes.
Joe Bob Perkins: And we’ve got a recorded history of them being able to operate above nameplate for short periods of time.
Scott Pryor: Yes.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Chris Sighinolfi: Just want to ask a question -- I guess it’s for Matt -- on capital budget and expectations -- the movement higher for 2017 looks like it’s roughly split between an allocation for Grand Prix and additional gathering CapEx. I know there’s some other things in there, but that looks like the bulk of it. And as we think about 2018, clearly the majority of your CapEx budget, if there is no partner, would be Grand Prix. But I’m just kind of getting a sense, given the earlier conversations around gas cuts and type curves, kind of what we should be thinking about gathering CapEx-wise for 2018 based on your current plans. I think the separately identified figure you have on Slide 10 is about $475 million for 2017. Do you expect that to drop materially? Or can you just give us some color on current expectations, would be helpful.
Scott Pryor: Yes. I guess I would say we expect meaningful CapEx in 2018, and you’re right, from the -- Grand Prix will obviously be the largest piece of that. We do expect a meaningful amount of CapEx in the Permian, both the Delaware and the Midland, for that other infrastructure -- gathering lines, compression and the like. The largest chunk of that increase you saw for the Permian infrastructure this year was related largely to the acquired assets, and that’s more of a shift in timing rather than an increase in total expected spend. So we ran through and -- we go over our CapEx plans monthly and we’re seeing we’re getting some more of the work done this year that we were originally anticipating getting done in ‘18 and even some of it into ‘19. So you’re seeing a shift of that capital into 2017. So related to the infrastructure buildout for the new Permian assets, I’d say the lion’s share of that is going to be now shifted into ‘17 and it’ll be lower in 2018 and ‘19.
Joe Bob Perkins: The lion’s share of the change, not...
Scott Pryor: Lion’s share of the change. And -- but we’re still going to have a significant amount of spending related to just our existing infrastructure on compression and gathering. We haven’t given that guidance yet. I guess all I’d say, to kind of preview that is I would expect it to be significant, and we’re still working through what we think that amount’s going to be.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. No, that’s really helpful. I know this is somewhat contingent on what the producers decide between now and year-end as to what they’re planning for next year, so I realize I’m a little premature. I just wanted to get a sense of it. I guess as it relates, Matt, you list on Slide 10 some ancillary spending on Downstream on some identified projects. I think it’s around $90 million. Any help in terms of explaining what exactly sort of sits in that bucket, and whether or not it has recurrence in 2018 would also be helpful.
Matt Meloy: Yes. So we don’t break out a lot of the smaller projects in there, but I would say a lot of that has to do with connectivity further downstream to the ethylene plants coming online. So a lot of that are tens of millions or $5 million, $10 million, going to X, Y and Z additional infrastructure further downstream. I think we’ll continue to have some of that spending going forward. That’s a bit lumpier and a little bit tougher to forecast, but we’ll be working through that as well when we provide our 2018 guidance on CapEx.
Chris Sighinolfi: No, this is all really, really helpful. Final question for me, and I trust this is not uniform; I’m just hopeful we can kind of get a sense of how to frame it up from an impact perspective, but when contracted LPG export shipment cancels, how does the cancellation fee received compare to, like, the net earnings or cash retention if the boat had arrived and you’d had -- you’ve been paid on the contract but also had to incur the operational costs of running the terminal? Is there a sense you can give us in terms of how this -- the ratio of that?
Scott Pryor: Our -- this is Scott, Chris. The -- our cancellation fees are different on each contract that we have across our portfolio. So giving you a sense of how all that breaks down would not be possible. We obviously know what this means and we are collecting for that [indiscernible]. When you look at it, the way you need to look at it is from the perspective of, we do not have any expense if we do not load the product itself. So operational expense is associated with that. With that said, and more from a positive perspective is, when we do receive a cancellation for a cargo and we collect that fee, obviously our team is working very hard to fill that void that might be in our schedule, whether it is a large vessel or a small vessel, in order to optimize the facility.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Sunil Sibal from Seaport. Your line is open.
Sunil Sibal: A couple of questions from me. In terms of the Grand Prix NGL pipe, I was wondering, in terms of the next few steps, do you intend to do an open season on that pipe?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes. There will be a bit of an open season at an appropriate time for a portion of the capacity on the pipe.
Sunil Sibal: And then I think on the -- originally, when you had announced the pipe and you had talked about it being routed to the North Texas also, and considering the amount of interest that you have seen right now, is that still the intent, and how should we kind of think about the relative contribution of Permian versus North Texas?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes. So what we included in the release, it is primarily a Permian pipeline, but we did say that we do plan to reach up into North Texas to connect to our North Texas assets. So that still is the scope of Grand Prix. But the lion’s share of the volumes that we would expect for the Grand Prix project we’ve announced so far is coming from the Permian.
Sunil Sibal: And then on the Flag City processing plant that you guys acquired, I was wondering if you could give us some sense of what kind of volumetric contracts are there on that plant, and how do they roll out over the next few years?
Joe Bob Perkins: We almost never describe the contractual terms of our customer contracts. What I would say is, it was an attractive acquisition for Targa. We’ve got a -- now, a new spare plant. Not new, but it’s a state-of-the-art spare plant that has operated and operated well. And those volumes were immediately integrated back to our Silver Oak facilities and are being processed there now. Customers don’t want me to describe those contractual terms and we just don’t do it for competitive reasons as well. But we did contrast it with volumes that sort of came in and out in a prior reported period as lower-margin IT contracts and that’s not what we acquired with the plant.
Sunil Sibal: Okay. Got it. And then just lastly on the splitter project, considering all that’s been going on with Noble, I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on that project, especially if Noble were to declare, say, bankruptcy or something like that. How do you kind of think about that asset long-term?
Joe Bob Perkins: It’s a terrific machine that we’re building. It will take condensate and crude and split it to valuable byproducts. Our byproducts -- valuable products. The contractual arrange with Noble -- I’m not describing anything different than you all read in the papers, and you know they’re taking measures of selling off certain businesses, and that helps the other businesses stay in place. You said, "If they go bankrupt." I’ve had a couple of people advise me, don’t anticipate getting your hands on -- it’s our asset -- getting your hands on that asset earlier than the multi-year term of the contract, because it’s valuable. And they -- any bankruptcy could probably figure out a way to finance that so as not to lose the ability to use it. Yes. If that were not the case, then we will either lease it out to someone else or commercialize it ourselves. I don’t anticipate that, even under a bankruptcy situation. I think that the asset -- their asset, the contract, would be maintained, they would continue to pay us and they would reap the rewards of continuing to pay us.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Timm Schneider from Evercore.
Timm Schneider: Just a quick question on the LPG export side outlook. I know a lot of your volumes go to Latin America, but just over the next couple of years, what are your discussion with Asian counterparties -- specifically, Chinese PDH units? And then also, India -- obviously, there’s a tremendous amount for demand -- or potential for demand growth in India, but no one ever really seems to talk about it. Anything going on, on that end, at this point?
Scott Pryor: Yes. Timm, this is Scott. First off, we have, as we’ve described it before, a very diverse comp contract portfolio today, which is inclusive of waterborne traders, end users both in Latin America, South America, Europe and the Asian marketplace. So we are in contact, in discussions, with customers across the globe today and have contracts in place to supply those various markets. So we’re a part of that today. Clearly, we’ve stated in previous discussions and earnings calls that our supply is predominantly moving to the Americas today, but the growth is in Asia. It is in places like India as well. And whether it’s through direct contracts with those customers or with our contracts that we have with waterborne traders, we would anticipate in the future an ever-growing amount of our supply moving to markets such as that. So those are all good stories. The fundamentals are shaping up very strongly. And again, when you look at the availability of supply in markets outside of the U.S., they are not growing very much, whereas the U.S. does have a tremendous story of growth, and as the global demand increases, more and more of that supply will move to those markets -- India and other places.
Timm Schneider: Got it. And as far as you have the color, I mean, I was trying to some numbers around this. Do you guys have a sense as to how much these OPEC supply cuts have affected LPG supply coming out of Qatar and some of these -- and some of the other exporting countries there? And have you guys been able to take market share on that front?
Scott Pryor: I would say that we probably saw more impact of the market during the first quarter of 2017. There may be -- you may have seen a little bit of an oversupply product on the water as we rolled into the second quarter, which likely could have impacted some of the availability of spot volumes coming out of the U.S. Those cuts, they’re obviously hard to track, but I think that the Middle East suppliers have been more conservative in what they’ve been willing to contract as a result of the announced cuts. But at the same time, as they exceed those production levels over and above what they have contracted, those volumes are on the market as a spot coming out of the Middle East. They would be pointed toward predominantly a Far East-type-related market and/or an India growth story.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Danilo Juvane from BMO Capital. Your line is open.
Danilo Juvane: I realize you’re running long here, so I’ll try to be brief. Just as an expansion on Grand Prix, it seems that there’s enough of a demand there for the project. Do you foresee now -- and perhaps this is a question for Scott, do you foresee the project returns being within that 5 to 7x right at the beginning of the project startup?
Scott Pryor: We’ve described getting to that five to seven time over time. In 2019, we expected to come online, second quarter. So we’re going to get partial year credit in 2019, and we do expect to ramp from there. So we’re not going to get specific on volume ramp at this point, and when we see getting to five to seven time. We just say, over our forecast period, we see getting to five to seven, and even potentially under that.
Danilo Juvane: Got it. By our math, in the Permian we estimate that you guys have the potential to produce a little more than 200,000 barrels per day of NGLs. Do you expect that to be roughly the amount that you will ship in the pipeline, longer-term, once your processing facilities come online?
Scott Pryor: So we have significant gross NGL production out of the Permian. I’m looking at for Q2 is give or take 155,000 barrels. We expect that to grow with the addition of our additional processing facilities. However, a lot of that existing production, we do have contracts with existing pipelines in that region. Some of them are longer. Some of them are rolling off, and some we can move under shorter term, move in the near term. So it’s a balance. So I wouldn’t just take the total gross NGL production and assume we can move it all on Grand Prix. But then we’ll have the addition of growing volumes plus third party volumes available for Grand Prix.
Danilo Juvane: Got it. Within the logistics segment, I noticed that the quarter had pretty strong uptick in OpEx. Can you explain what the driver is there?
Scott Pryor: Yes. So when you look at the operating expense for the logistic -- quarter to quarter, so versus the first quarter, the total operating expense was actually a bit lower. When you look at it compared to last year, there’s a couple of drivers. One, the CBF Train 5 was online full quarter this year, and it was starting up about this time last year. And there’s also the variable component in our Downstream Business, and we saw higher commodity prices in the second quarter of this year versus the second quarter of last year.
Danilo Juvane: Thank you. Appreciate that. Last one for me. I appreciate that your focus is on the Permian, but the Bakken is -- also has some pretty strong GORs lately. Can you talk about the possibility of potentially adding incremental processing capacity there?
Scott Pryor: Yes. As I mentioned in the scripted comments, the Badlands volumes -- they grew second quarter to first quarter of this year, but we’ve seen a relatively large uptick here in July. So with the growth number I gave you, that kind of puts it in the 65 million to 67 million a day at the end of July for the Badlands volume, so it’s up significantly. We still have some additional capacity there. But looking out, with our 90 million a day, that’s something that would have to be considered given the activity that we’re seeing up there. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Craig Shere. Your line is open.
Craig Shere: Quickly on the guidance for industry ethane recovery that you gave, could you opine on your EBITDA growth outlook and vision through 2021? What portion might more generally be related to ethane recovery?
Scott Pryor: So when we looked at -- we did have some additional recovery going out in that forecast. But even in that forecast, we did not assume 100% at all of our plants over the entire forecast period. Our assumption -- it moved up over time. But -- so it was a piece of it, but it wasn’t the primary driver of that growth.
Craig Shere: Okay. So you would envision additional running room without much or any CapEx spend, post the horizon period, just on full recovery?
Joe Bob Perkins: I think another way of describing it is consistent with multiple elements of the forecast outlook. We were providing line of sight, not trying to crowd the assumptions, relative to an outlook that for multiple years, not each quarter, felt good to us, and that we could perform against. Therefore, we weren’t in total. Just like any other element, we would not -- we were not assuming a total ethane recovery scenario. That wouldn’t have been consistent with, for example, assuming zero spot volumes for exports.
Matt Meloy: Yes. And also, we assumed approximately a $0.60 NGL over that forecast period. So with that incremental demand Scott talked about ethane coming on, the average NGL price today for us is already over $0.60 if you look at today’s prices. So with recovering that additional amount of ethane, we would -- it would also likely result in an increased price for ethane. But we use $0.60 ethane over the whole forecast period. [Multiple Speakers] Thank you. I had a lot of correction.
Joe Bob Perkins: People’s eyes were getting wide. And Scott probably should have been answering, because we also use a $3-per-MMBtu natural gas. And the relationship of gas and ethane makes all the difference, right? So you can tell that that’s not a super-strong ethane recovery scenario.
Craig Shere: My last question -- after the last equity offering, I think you’ve kind of gotten your hands around the balance sheet. Are you thinking, as we move into 2018 and we have the Permian pipeline spend, the -- and also ultimately the Outrigger earnouts, that it will be a little more of an even debt and equity mix in terms of funding?
Matt Meloy: Yes. Good question. Our balance sheet right now, with the equity we’ve raised today, is in pretty good shape. The 3.4 times compliance ratio is right in the middle of our target zone of three to four times, and even on a reported LTM debt to EBITDA, we’re in the low 4s -- about 4.1 times. So as we go through our planning cycle for 2018 and firm up our CapEx estimates for that year, we will still likely need some additional piece of that to be equity financed. Typically we’ve financed our growth CapEx on a 50% debt, 50% equity basis. This year it’s been over-equitized for all the reasons that we’ve talked about. So I would expect a significant equity component in 2018. But I think you’re right, we’ll be closer to our normal 50% debt, 50% equity. Where exactly we shake out on there, I think will depend on the size of the overall capital budget.
Joe Bob Perkins: Well, and we also have really good visibility on the EBITDA, which is part of maintaining that balance sheet. And that visibility, we -- if you heard, we feel even better about. So it’s that balance of debt to EBITDA as we finish our full process, which is not just on the cost.
Matt Meloy: And the total size of the capital [indiscernible].
Joe Bob Perkins : Exactly.
Craig Shere: And on the subject of the equity funding longer term, we’re hearing from more and more peers that they’re just comfortable having larger coverage. As you build, can you envision a consistent 1.2 times plus coverage, if you have plenty of running room on ongoing growth projects?
Joe Bob Perkins: I have had people point to a comment in a script, and I think it was now three or four quarters ago, where through a series of questions we got talked through, it used to be 1.1 to 1.2. And I think Joe Bob said, I guess that it means 1.2-plus. I don’t come to a different conclusion than when that dialogue created the quote for Joe Bob of saying 1.2-plus. We’re just not saying, where is the range right now. We’re figuring it out. We’ve got a lot more scale, a lot more diversity, than we did as that MLP distribution coverage. But we’re probably more conservative, having gone through what we went. Still, there’s a reasonable signal. It’s not a new target. It’s not a new band. But you’re reading my quote from multiple quarters ago, and I wouldn’t say it’s directionally wrong.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session, and I’d now like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you, Operator. Thanks to everybody who stayed on the phone for that -- the long call. We did want to be able to answer everybody’s questions. We hope we’ve done so completely and with at least interesting color. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact Sanjay, Jen or any of us. Thanks, operator.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Targa Resources First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Jennifer Kneale, VP-Finance. Ma'am, go ahead.
Jennifer Kneale: Thank you, Chris. I'd like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call for Targa Resources Corp. I would also like to welcome Sanjay Lad to his first earnings call for Targa as our recently hired Director of Investor Relations. Before we get started, I would like to mention that Targa Resources Corp., Targa, TRC or the company, has published its earnings release and an updated investor presentation, which are available on our website, www.targaresources.com. Any statements made during this call that might include the company's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Please note that actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our recent SEC filings, including the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Danny Middlebrooks, EVP of Northern Field Gathering and Processing, our North Dakota position; Pat McDonie, EVP of Southern Field Gathering and Processing; and Scott Pryor, EVP of Logistics and Marketing, our downstream business; will be joining Joe Bob Perkins, CEO; and Matt Meloy, CFO, with prepared remarks today. Joe Bob will begin the call. We'll then turn it over to Matt to discuss first quarter 2017 results. And then Danny, Pat and Scott will discuss their business areas in that order. After closing remarks from Joe Bob, we will then open the call up for questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Jen. Good morning. It's a beautiful morning in Houston, and we appreciate you joining us today. I'm going to begin today's call with an update on the integration of our recent Permian acquisition. I will then discuss some exciting new growth CapEx projects that we are officially announcing today and then provide an updated estimate of 2017 growth CapEx for our announced projects. I will finish my initial prepared remarks with some color on the outlook for Targa over the near- and long-term before turning it over to Matt to discuss the first quarter results. One of our biggest first quarter highlights was the announcement and then later the March 1 closing of the acquisition of additional Delaware and Midland Basin midstream assets in the Permian Basin. For the quarter, we benefited from one month of volume and margin from these assets. We connected the acquired Delaware Basin assets to our Sand Hills system, and we're flowing natural gas volumes to Sand Hills very shortly after close. And we're busy connecting wells, and continuing to build out our Delaware Basin natural gas and crude footprints. In the Midland Basin, we expect to connect the acquired assets to our WestTX system in the third quarter of this year. When you look at the details of our earnings release, in our Q1 results, the acquired Delaware natural gas inlet volumes are reported in Sand Hills and the acquired Midland asset volumes are reported in SAOU, reflective of the bolt-on nature of the acquisition. You may also notice that Versado and Sand Hills volumes, are being grouped and reported as Permian-Delaware, and WestTX and SAOU volumes as Permian-Midland, which most accurately describes how we manage our combined Permian footprints and how we expect them to continue to develop. And you'll note the crude volumes from the acquired assets for both Delaware and Midland are included in a new line item called crude oil gathered, Permian in the press release and our 10-Q. Producer activity on the dedicated acreage underpinning the acquired assets is strong and increasing. And our long-term outlook for the potential of the area around the acquired and expanding assets continues to strengthen. As a result of our expectations, for increasing activity around the Delaware acquisition and increasing Delaware activity around our northern Sand Hills and southern Versado assets. We are officially announcing a new 250 million cubic feet per day gas processing plant serving that combined area of the Delaware Basin. It will be named the Wildcat plant. Total growth CapEx for the Wildcat plant is estimated to be about $130 million, and the plant is expected to be in service in the third quarter of next year. In addition to Wildcat, our 60 million cubic feet per day Oahu gas processing plant in the Delaware will begin service in the fourth quarter of this year. We are also adding associated pipeline infrastructure connecting our Versado and Sand Hills systems to each other and to the new acquisition. These pipes, and the addition of Oahu and the Wildcat plants, will increase our flexibility to support volume growth from production of that combined portion of the Delaware. With these projects, all of our Permian systems will then be connected, multi-plants, multi-sites, multi-systems all interconnected, continuing to increase our operational capabilities, reliability and efficiency of capital spend. In the Permian Midland, today, we are announcing a new 200 million cubic feet per day gas processing plant in WestTX in the Midland Basin. This will be named the Johnson plant, after Targa cofounder, Roy Johnson. Targa would not exist if it were not for the vision of Roy Johnson. The Joyce and Johnson plants are well-placed Permian Basin reminders of the contributions of two of our retired founders. And our small gesture of thanks to Rene and Roy for all of their hard work getting Targa started. Johnson plant is estimated to cost approximately $90 million net to Targa's 72.8% interest and is expected to begin service by the third quarter of 2018. The Johnson plant is expected online within two quarters of the Joyce plant, demonstrating the accelerating need for additional processing capacity in our portion of the Midland Basin. Activity in and around our WestTX system continues to increase significantly, and we're also seeing increasing activity around SAOU. Both systems will benefit over time as producers continue to drill on existing dedicated acreage, on our newly acquired dedicated acreage, and on new dedications. It kind of amazes me, pro forma for the plants announced today, Targa will have in the middle of 2018 over 2.4 billion cubic feet per day of gross processing capacity in the Permian Basin, spanning across some of the most attractive acreage in the Delaware and Midland Basins. And from the second quarter of 2016, through the expected completion of the projects underway, as a result of organic growth and the recent acquisition, Targa will have added over 1 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity in the Permian Basin. Even if we do not experience much commodity price recovery beyond today's strip levels over the foreseeable future, Targa's strong positioning in the Permian is likely to result in attractive volume and margin growth. Turning to some of our other field G&P areas outside of the Permian, there are attractive opportunities for additional investment in the Bakken, and we are undertaking system expansions this year to support expected volume growth in late 2017, 2018 and beyond. This increased growth capital spending in the Bakken is primarily related to additional compression, additional LACT units and pipelines. In South Texas, our 200 million cubic feet per day Raptor plant is mechanically complete, and we're initiating startup. Working closely with our partners, Sanchez Production Partners, expectations for volume growth on our system drove the decision to expand the Raptor plant to 260 million cubic feet per day before it was even complete. And that expansion is expected to be completed mid-summer 2017. As a result of all the activity that we are seeing across our gathering and processing systems, we're increasing our estimated 2017 net G&P growth CapEx spending for announced projects to $800 million from our previous estimate of about $540 million. We continue to focus on maximizing our asset positions by coordinating our gathering and processing business activities with our downstream businesses, to drive increasing NGL volumes downstream. Given our expectations for additional ethane extraction, as the new petrochemical facilities come online, and for overall NGL production growth, given our robust G&P volume outlook, we expect additional volumes to flow to our available capacity at Mont Belvieu. Also, there have been recent announcements and discussions of potential pipeline projects to handle crude, natural gas and natural gas liquid take-away from the Permian Basin. Those announcements are really a good thing for Permian producers and Permian G&P operators, including Targa. As a result of our significant and growing gas processing positions I mentioned a little while ago, and the natural gas and NGLs under our control, coupled with our extensive geographic asset footprint, we are advantaged as a customer, partner or potential owner in assessing the best strategies for managing our volumes. Shifting further downstream, our 2017 estimated growth CapEx announced for downstream projects is primarily driven by the completion of our 35,000 barrel per day crude and condensate splitter at Channelview, and for adding additional capabilities at and around Mont Belvieu as we continue to invest capital to increase our storage footprint and to enhance our downstream connectivity, for example to petrochemical complexes in expansion mode. In aggregate, across all Targa businesses, we are raising our full-year 2017 forecasted growth CapEx for announced projects to approximately $960 million, from the $700 million or more discussed last quarter. And, we are likely to spend more than that, if activity continues and some of the unannounced projects under development are successful. Targa's development activity right now is robust with many attractive projects across our portfolio of assets. Naturally, the size and scale of projects under development varies, and we're working on potential new additional G&P and downstream projects. So turning to our first quarter results, consistent with our previous expectations, the strength of our field G&P business drove adjusted EBITDA 5% higher versus the first quarter of 2016. It's always pluses and minuses to expectations as we enter a quarter. And some of the headwinds we saw in the first quarter were slightly lower-than-expected sequential field G&P volumes, lower LPG margins from our export business and higher downstream OpEx. Despite those headwinds, our first quarter dividend coverage was approximately 1 times, inclusive of the issuance of more than 13 million shares during the quarter through a successful follow-on offering in our ATM program. These equity proceeds were used to fund the initial consideration for our March 1 Permian acquisition and for our growth capital spending. Given the so-called seasonality, observed over the last few years in some of our downstream businesses, we expect that second quarter EBITDA and dividend coverage may be lower than first quarter results. However, over the third and fourth quarters, we expect increasing operating margin in both our G&P and downstream segments; and with pretty good visibility that the fourth quarter will generate the highest operating margin of the year for both segments. So while dividend coverage is likely to be lower in the second quarter, we expect it to be significantly higher by the fourth quarter and continue to estimate full-year dividend coverage of 1 times or better. Then, with improving visibility, as we look forward into 2018 and 2019, and benefit from full-year contributions from our growth CapEx projects and increasing activity levels, we expect robust year-over-year operating margin growth both in G&P and downstream, even in an environment where commodity prices remain range-bound around today's levels. The excitement at Targa from our commercial and operational teams is palpable and contagious. Everyone is very busy, perhaps the busiest we've ever been, working on attractive small, medium and larger deals and projects, and experiencing day-to-day progress and successes across multiple fronts around our contractual positions and our asset footprints. The activity, enthusiasm and visibility of future successes on a long list of potential growth projects in a plus or minus $50 per barrel crude world, compared to activity levels in the $80 per barrel world, is amazing to me, and a true testament to our well-placed asset positions and the drilling results of our upstream customers as they continue to get better and better. With that perhaps too-long introduction, I'll turn the call over to Matt to discuss Targa's results for the first quarter.
Matthew Meloy: Thanks, Joe Bob. Targa's reported adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $277 million, a 5% increase compared to the same period in 2016, largely due to higher commodity prices, continued volume growth in Permian G&P and the addition of one quarter's contribution of the Noble splitter payment, partially offset by lower volumes on our other G&P regions and lower margins from our downstream business. Reported net maintenance capital expenditures were $25 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to $14 million in the first quarter of 2016. We continue to estimate approximately $110 million of net maintenance capital expenditures for 2017. Distributable cash flow for the first quarter was $194 million, resulting in dividend coverage of approximately 1 times. Generally, our second quarter financial results are the lowest of the four quarters, given some seasonality in our downstream businesses. And we expect our operating margin to ramp up in the second half of the year, largely due to increasing contributions from our Permian acquisition and cash flow from the completion of growth CapEx projects. As a result, our full-year 2017 outlook for dividend coverage of 1.0 times or better remains unchanged. Let's now turn to our segment level results. For the Gathering and Processing segment, reported operating margin for the first quarter of 2017 increased by 53% compared to last year, primarily due to higher commodity prices and higher inlet volumes in the Permian Basin despite lower overall field G&P inlet volumes. NGL prices were 79% higher, condensate prices were 75% higher and natural gas prices were 63% higher, when compared to the first quarter of 2016. First quarter reported 2017 field natural gas plant inlet volumes were approximately flat compared to the first quarter of 2016. First quarter year-over-year volumes were higher in WestTX, SAOU and Versado, offset by lower volumes in WestOK, SouthOK, South Texas, North Texas, Sand Hills and Badlands. Compared to fourth quarter 2016 volumes, Permian volumes grew modestly, but our expectations for the rest of 2017 are unchanged, and our expectations for 2018 are higher. Volumes in South Texas were sequentially lower, which impacted our first quarter results, but our outlook for South Texas also continues to improve as rigs move back into the Eagle Ford. In the Bakken, crude oil gathered volumes were 114,000 barrels per day in the first quarter, up approximately 5% versus the same time period last year and approximately 10% higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Crude oil gathered volumes for the Permian are currently about 26,000 barrels per day. For our downstream segment, first quarter reported operating margin declined 17%, primarily due to lower LPG export margin, and lower wholesale and marketing margins, and higher OpEx associated with maintenance and other items. Those variables were partially offset by higher fractionation margin. In our LPG export business, we exported approximately 6.5 million barrels per month of propane and butane, but a strong volume quarter was partially offset by lower fees. Now let's discuss our capital structure and liquidity. In the first quarter of 2017, using borrowings under the TRC revolver we repaid the remaining $160 million in principal, outstanding under the TRC term loan, which should generate approximately $5 million in annual interest savings. During the first quarter, we increased the size of our accounts receivable facility at TRP from $275 million to $350 million. As of March 31, we had no amounts outstanding under TRP's $1.6 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due October 2020. On debt compliance, TRP's leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was 3.6 times versus a compliance covenant of 5.5 times. We also had borrowings of $285 million under our accounts receivables securitization facility at quarter end. TRP revolver availability at quarter end was $1.6 billion. As of March 31, TRC had $435 million in borrowings outstanding under our $670 million senior secured credit facility, an increase of $160 million compared to year-end after paying off the TRC term loan. TRC revolver availability at quarter-end was approximately $235 million. Including approximately $80 million in cash, total Targa liquidity at quarter-end was approximately $1.9 billion. For equity funding, we continued to utilize the ATM program to fund our growth CapEx projects. And we have raised approximately $240 million of equity under the ATM program through April. While we still have remaining capacity available on our current equity distribution agreement, we expect to file a second $750 million equity distribution agreement in the near future, so overlapping agreements are in place such that we always have access under an available EDA, so we can issue equity through the ATM if needed. We expect to continue to use our ATM program to fund the equity portion of our growth CapEx program and our first earn-out payment related to the Permian acquisition payable on April 2018. I'd like to briefly provide some color on our current expectations for the earn-out payments related to our Permian acquisition that closed March 1. In our financials, we recorded a $462 million contingent consideration liability related to the current fair value estimate of the earn-out. We believe that this is a relatively reasonable reflection of our current view of the likely size of the earn-out payments, which would mean total consideration to the sellers of just over $1 billion. In our corporate hedging program, we executed additional hedges during the first quarter. We added - balance of the year 2017 through 2019, natural gas, NGL and crude swaps. Pro forma as of March 31, 2017 for non-fee-based operating margin relative to the partnership's current estimate of equity volumes from field, gathering and processing, for 2017 we estimate we've hedged approximately 75% of natural gas, 70% of condensate and 60% of NGL volumes. For 2018, we estimate we've hedged approximately 50% of natural gas, 50% of condensate and 25% of NGL volumes. On to taxes for a minute, our first quarter financials include a line item for income tax expense of approximately $71 million during the first quarter. Given our expectation that we will not be a cash taxpayer for at least five years this may cause some confusion. GAAP convention requires that estimates be made for the year based off of book income, which may cause lumpiness from quarter to quarter. The $71 million of income-tax expense in the first quarter is expected to be offset by significant income tax benefits in the second through fourth quarters that we expect to result in a cumulative tax benefit for 2017, and continued effective cash tax rate of 0% for 2017. We also benefited from a cash tax add-back to DCF of approximately $15 million for the quarter that includes an adjustment reflecting the benefit from a net operating loss carryback to 2014 and 2015 taxes and a Texas margin tax refund. I will now turn the call over to Danny Middlebrooks, who leads our commercial efforts in North Dakota. Danny?
Dan Middlebrooks: Thank you, Matt. Despite the impact of January and February of severe winter weather, our Badlands crude oil gathered volumes increased sequentially by approximately 10%. Our natural gas volumes decreased quarter-over-quarter due to the severe winter weather, that are currently higher than the fourth quarter as we benefit from warmer weather and volumes coming back online that were shut in during the first quarter while producers were fracking wells. With respect to the Badlands system, drilling activity is higher - drilled uncompleted wells, or DUCs are being completed. And the general outlook for the commodity prices required for the producers to increase activity levels has improved. As a result, we are increasing our 2017 forecasted CapEx estimates for our Badlands system by $75 million. Over the seasonal construction season, we will be expanding our infrastructure by adding compression at multiple locations, LACT units for well connections and pipelines, and then looping up some additional pipelines. These expansions will support an expected drilling ramp in late 2017, continuing into 2018, and also contribute to our expectation that crude and natural gas volumes will be higher, average 2017 versus average 2016. Frontloading our 2017 spending and some of our 2018 spend helps us avoid winter weather construction and positions us well for additional growth in 2018. Given our attractive per-unit margins for both gas and crude oil in the Bakken, we're excited about the potential growth opportunities that we're beginning to see returned to Bakken. I will now turn the call over to Pat, who leads our Southern Field G&P business. Pat?
Patrick McDonie: Thanks, Danny, and good morning, everyone. Southern Field G&P results in the first quarter of 2017 were largely driven by continued growth in Permian Basin activity. The growth projects announced earlier on the call by Joe Bob will support the experienced rapid increase in volume growth on our systems in both the Delaware and Midland Basins. In WestTX, the 200 million cubic feet per day Buffalo plant came online in the second quarter of 2016. The 45 million cubic feet per day Benedum Plant was restarted in the first quarter of 2017, and an additional 20 million cubic feet per day expansion at Midkiff will be completed in the second quarter of 2017. In other words, we added 245 million cubic feet per day of organic processing capacity over the last year in the Midland Basin, and we'll add another 420 million cubic feet per day of organic capacity between now and the middle of 2018, with the added compression at Midkiff and the Joyce and Johnson plants announced earlier. Looking forward, we would likely need additional infrastructure in the Permian in 2019 and beyond to support the expected activity on acreage dedicated to our system. We only have one-month worth of benefit from our recently acquired Midland assets, but the outlook for growth for both natural gas and crude from existing contracts was robust when we executed the acquisition agreements. And based on discussions with our dedicated producers, our expectations have only gotten better. Turning to the Delaware Basin, our recently acquired Delaware assets are integrated into Sand Hills and we are spending significant growth capital to continue to build out our gas and crude systems. The 60 million cubic feet per day of Oahu plant will be online during the fourth quarter. And the newly announced 250 million cubic feet per day Wildcat plant will be online in the third quarter of 2018. As Joe Bob mentioned, part of our spending in the Delaware will connect the Versado and Sand Hills systems, meaning we will then have full interconnectivity across our Permian systems. This interconnectivity will benefit our customers with increased system flexibility and optionality, supporting our continued efforts to provide reliable services and grow our footprint across the Permian. We completed our first month as an operator of crude assets in the Permian successfully. And while it is obviously early and starting small, we are excited about the outlook for building out our crude infrastructure and competing for volumes outside of acreage already dedicated to Targa. Moving to the STACK, SCOOP, we continue to have commercial success in picking up additional acreage packages. So while we do not yet expect legacy basin declines to be fully offset by growing activity from these regions, our outlook continues to strengthen. We are very well positioned to benefit from the gradual northwest movement of activity targeting the STACK, and are focused on identifying attractive opportunities to put capital to work, growing our infrastructure further south in Woodward, Dewey, Blaine and Kingfisher counties. In SouthOK, we are pleased to announce that we are currently building a line that will result in higher volumes in the back half of 2017, driven by the execution of an agreement that will bring additional SCOOP volumes to our system. This line will also be utilized to support projected growth in SCOOP volumes in the future. In SouthTX, as previously discussed, there was a decrease in inlet volumes in Q1 2017 relative to Q4 2016, associated with the short-term disruption as one of our key producers had production from multiple well pads shut in during the first quarter, while fracking offset newly drilled wells. As Joe Bob mentioned previously, our 200 million cubic feet per day Raptor plant is mechanically complete, and we are initiating startup. The 60 million cubic feet per day expansion is slated to be complete by mid-summer 2017 and will provide much-needed support for growing Sanchez volumes. For 2017, we continue to expect 2017 average field G&P inlet volumes to be 10% higher than 2016, driven by year-over-year inlet volume growth of 20% in the Permian Basin. I will now turn the call over to Scott Pryor, who leads our Downstream businesses. Scott?
Scott Pryor: Thanks, Pat. In our Downstream segment, our LPG export volumes, fractionation volumes and treating volumes were all higher in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. We exported 6.5 million barrels per month of propane and butanes from Galena Park, driven by continued global demand strength throughout the first quarter despite periods of high domestic propane prices. However, the growth in volumes was not enough to offset the impact of margin compression on both term and spot deals, as some of our older contracts roll off. Similar to previous years, we are likely to see some headwinds in the LPG export business in the second quarter, given backwardation in market prices as we come off a period of higher demand. We are aware of some cancellations at other facilities. But at this point, we have not experienced any at Galena Park. Looking forward, our outlook is unchanged given our substantial long-term contract position and favorable global fundamentals for U.S. LPG exports. In our fractionation business, volumes were approximately 2% higher quarter-over-quarter, as we benefited from higher volumes on our G&P systems in the Permian Basin and increasing domestic production. We expect this positive volume trend to continue. And given our available capacity at Mont Belvieu, fractionation margin is likely to increase over the course of 2017 and beyond, as we benefit from continued domestic volume growth and addition of more Gulf Coast based petrochemical cracker capacity, which creates more demand for ethane. As Joe Bob mentioned earlier, the increasing domestic volume growth outlook is also likely to accelerate the need for additional fractionation space at Mont Belvieu. And we could have growth CapEx spending for Train 6 in 2018, depending on expected volumes. Overall, the outlook for Targa's downstream business continues to strengthen, driven by continued integration with our growing G&P business and the flow of NGLs to our asset position along the U.S. Gulf Coast. And with that, I turn the call back over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you, Scott, and thanks to all the speakers. My concluding remarks, now I feel redundant to the well-done remarks of the team, so I'll be brief. The first quarter of 2017 flew by, thankfully much more positive than the first quarter of 2016. And although the Targa employee attitude was still positive in 2016 relative to the circumstances, the energy and attitude at this time is much preferred. Hopefully, you can sense our excitement at Targa. We've had a lot of very attractive growth projects announced and/or underway, and see a runway for continued attractive opportunities going forward. Today, we increased our full-year 2017 forecasted growth CapEx for announced projects to approximately $960 million from $700-plus million last quarter. And we're likely to spend more, if activity continues and some of the unannounced projects under development are successful. And our strong available liquidity and demonstrated access to the capital markets positions us well to fund our current and future projects. Our 2017 field G&P volume guidance is unchanged versus our last earnings call, so I probably even feel better. Overall, we continue to expect field G&P inlet volumes to be about 10% higher for average 2017 versus average 2016, driven by volumes about 20% higher in the Permian Basin and higher Bakken volumes and higher South Texas volumes, partially offset by lower North Texas, WestOK and SouthOK volumes. Importantly, our outlook beyond 2017 continues to strengthen, as our visibility around activity and project supports our expectations for the potential of significant margin expansion for our G&P segment in 2018 and 2019. Our field G&P business will continue to support our activities downstream, and the outlook for higher fractionation volumes and a substantially contracted LPG export business, means we should see higher year-over-year margins for our downstream business over the foreseeable future. And our dividend coverage outlook remains unchanged. We continue to expect the dividend coverage of 1.0 times or better, assuming that 2017 dividend of $3.64 per common share and we expect coverage to improve beyond 2017 as we benefit from full-year contributions from growth CapEx projects underway. So thank you all very much. And with that, operator, please open the lineup for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brandon Blossman from Tudor Pickering. Your line is now open.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning, Brandon.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yours was the first note I saw this morning, you get up early.
Brandon Blossman: Way too early. This may not be a fair question, Joe Bob. But looking through your presentation on your asset overview slide, there's a new bullet there, integration of G&P and Downstream assets continued area of focus, should I read anything into that?
Joe Bob Perkins: It's continued. It has been a focus for some time. I hope you've all heard me bragging on how much better it's working over the last year or so, with continued efforts, but Scott's group, Pat's group, Danny's group couldn't be working better. That's not right. They're going to keep working better and better, but I'm very happy with how they're working.
Brandon Blossman: All right, we're not talking about any hard assets connecting those two entities, are we?
Joe Bob Perkins: I was just talking about how well the group was working together.
Brandon Blossman: There's no foreshadowing that I should read into that?
Joe Bob Perkins: I try not to do foreshadowing.
Brandon Blossman: Sometimes, you do. Sometimes, you do.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay.
Brandon Blossman: All right, I'll leave that one. On the LPG export margins, Scott, any hints as to what we should see on a go-forward basis? So, obviously, a little margin compression Q-over-Q here. Any help on how we should think about that over the next few quarters?
Scott Pryor: I would just say that we continue to manage our contract portfolio very closely. We are working with existing customers, both on their current contracts as well as potential contracts going forward. And we continue to work very closely with potential contracts. We'll evaluate each opportunity that's out there, whether it is a term-related contract or it's a spot-related contract that fits us well. Clearly, when we first initiated our projects in 2013 and 2014 with our first level of contracting, we're not seeing those types of levels that we first had in that first initial contracts. But we are still - we still have attractive contracts on the books in our portfolio, and we believe that the market demand will continue to grow. And we have a wonderful position on the U.S. Gulf Coast, and we'll meet the demand as it continues to increase.
Brandon Blossman: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful, Scott. I'll leave it there for someone else.
Scott Pryor: Thank you.
A –Matthew Meloy: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Kristina Kazarian from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Kristina Kazarian: Good afternoon, guys.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning.
Kristina Kazarian: Can you guys provide a bit more color on volume trends in the quarter and just really relative to what you were expecting for the quarter and for the year? Maybe start on smaller, but the Eagle Ford declines, and then more importantly on the Permian side. Just could you touch on the cadence or what you guys are thinking of growth rate throughout the year to kind of get to your 20% growth outlook guidance?
Joe Bob Perkins: I think I would start with and I may not have said it clearly, it was really pretty much on our expectations. Since the two-and-a-half months of our last quarterly earnings call, our feel and activity across the board has been positive. Cadence within the quarter, I'm not sure I'm good enough to do, and Pat's kind of looking at me like cadence within the quarter is difficult.
Kristina Kazarian: Cadence within the year.
Joe Bob Perkins: Oh, Cadence within the year. All of those up and to the right for the end of the year, we would expect fourth quarter to be the best volume in all of them. You mentioned, Eagle Ford. There were some unique situations about the Eagle Ford, but we feel very positive about the success of Sanchez. They, by the way, will have their earnings call next week and are probably the best source for how they're doing, but we handle an awful lot of that volume. Permian, I think we did give a lot of color. You got anything you want to add, Pat?
Patrick McDonie: Yes. I mean, I think, in the Permian, what you see in the first quarter is always a lot of noise. You have the heater treaters on dealing with the winter weather, et cetera, timing on fracs relative to offset production, et cetera. But what we are producing today versus what we reported is an indication of what we expect throughout the year. And I can tell you that's up, and volume growth is expected to continue. The activity level of our producers, the infrastructure that we've announced is absolutely a depiction of and a reaction to the volume growth that we expect and we are seeing, on a daily basis, a monthly basis, across our system.
Kristina Kazarian: Great. And then circling back to what I think Brandon may have been trying here. Joe Bob, I thought I heard in your opening comments that with all the new projects in the Permian being announced by others, it sounded like you may have been - you may have alluded to a willingness to participate in something here. Did I hear that right? And if so, can you maybe talk about what the most attractive types of assets to participate in would be?
Joe Bob Perkins: You heard part of it right with the very attractive supply position we have in the Permian Basin across our Gathering and Processing assets. We are involved in discussions as an important customer or potential partner, and we certainly look at work on our own. We want to be very thoughtful about what are the right decisions for Targa along those takeaway projects, in particular, where we've got that large gas and NGL position. We want to do the right thing for our customers, the right thing for our shareholders. And we've got attractive options.
Kristina Kazarian: Got it. That was it for me. Thank you, guys.
A –Matthew Meloy: Okay, thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Darren Horowitz from Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Darren Horowitz: Good morning, guys.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning.
Darren Horowitz: Scott, I wanted to go back to some comments that you had mentioned around the downstream segment profitability over the course of this year. I'm thinking about aggregate LPG margin compression. Can you give us a sense of the amount of term contract capacity that's rolling off over the course of this year? And as we think about the segment's profitability, do you think that the increase in frac margin magnitude that you alluded to over the course of this year could be enough to offset that LPG margin compression if it continues?
Scott Pryor: Well, what I would say is that, first off, we gave some pretty detailed information in our last earnings call when we talked about how contracted we are for a long period of time. When you think about the availability of current space that we have over and above those term contracts, when we're selling spot volumes per se, those are not the same sort of levels we saw on spot values, say, again, a few years back. Contracting levels, for us, we feel very comfortable with. When you think about going forward, again, I'll go back to what I said earlier, and that is, is we're working with a variety of customers on a variety of discussions relative to their volume needs. And we will continue that effort and again contract for what fits Targa well.
Darren Horowitz: Okay. And then as a follow-up, Matt, if I could go back to the $462 million of contingent consideration liability around the fair value of the earn-out on those acquired assets. I know, you got some time before February next year. But can you give us a little bit more detail around those assumptions? Because I - if I'm not mistaken, they're based on a multiple of gross margin realized on the legacy contracts. So I'm wondering, from a contractual perspective, possibly what is expiring, how that's changed? I realize that you don't have any new contracts included. So as the commercial effort ramps up, the accretion becomes higher. But I'd like to know what's behind the fair value mark-to-market.
Matthew Meloy: Yes. So what's on the books right now is the $462 million, which you referenced. We base that off of forecasts of discussion with our customers, drilling expectations over the next several years. And we put that on the books. We think that is not an unreasonable assessment of where we'd expect the actual payout to be. Of course, it's going to be dependent on volumes in both the Midland and the Delaware on crude and gas. The operating margin for us could be significantly higher than that as we add contracts that weren't in place as of March 1, as of the acquisition date. So - but those are all the things that we're going to have to take a look at on a quarterly basis going forward. And then it'll be - when we get into the first quarter of next year, we'll be making that first payment, and we'll continue to estimate through the life of the remaining earn-out, and then it will get trued up in early 2019.
Darren Horowitz: Thank you.
Matthew Meloy: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni from UBS.
Shneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning, guys. I was wondering, if we can start off with the Outrigger. Is it fair to assume that the tariffs for your new build capital will reflect build economics versus the typical tariffs that we would expect? And so overall, there would be kind of a margin improvement for your overall Permian position? And then in talking about that, in respect to the payments and so forth that still need to be made, given that there are potential bottlenecks at Waha, is there a risk that it slows the Outrigger ramp and perversely effectively results in lower payment that you'll make just because of the timing of it?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, there was a lot in there. Let's start with the last one I heard, which was Waha. Waha has constraints. There are multiple projects announced to try to solve the Waha takeaway. And it does not appear to be the driving force to producer activity from our perspective today. They're drilling primarily for oil economics, and it is impacting the expected gas netback, but I don't think it is the driving force. There's more to it than that, including their logistics and ability to get rigs and get equipment in a timely basis. And that appears to be the bigger constraint to us, taking a step in front of that, relative to - what was the first part of the question?
Matthew Meloy: First part was fees.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay, fees. We've said publicly, associated with the acquisition that the existing contracts at both the Midland and Delaware site with 15-sort-of-year average life. We're done in a difficult time by the developers and to meet needs of producers who needed infrastructure in order to develop their own projects and that those contracts reflected the risks and greenfield nature, new build of the time. You sort of answered your own question in the question. And we continue to benefit from those higher than average Permian margins on the gas and oil side. Yes, that will have an impact on our overall profitability. Assets you see us building - I'll point the Wildcat as an example, will not necessarily just serve new contracts. They'll serve the newly acquired contracts. So serve those newly acquired contracts, other dedications we get and dedications we already have. So it's - you won't be able to see the moving pieces, but it is a positive for us.
Shneur Gershuni: Great. And as a follow-up question, for the last year, there's been a hyper focus on the Permian from operators, the Street and so forth. You talked about the Bakken in your prepared remarks. Given how high returns on capital are there, is this a potential source of material earnings expansion over the next few years? Are there some interesting trends that you'd like to share with us with respect to your views on the Bakken?
Joe Bob Perkins: I thought Danny's color was terrific, which is it has gotten more positive even at today's pricing, that we've got visibility with good communications with our producers. And we are spending capital in 2017 for the benefit of the end of 2017, 2018 and beyond. Now you all can see the number of rigs moving to the Bakken just this weekend. I'm not comparing it to the Permian. But when you're in a good place for where those rigs are moving and where activity is occurring, I think it's - I think we're indicating a positive.
Shneur Gershuni: All right. Cool. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color, guys.
Matthew Meloy: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Jeremy Tonet: Good morning.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning.
Jeremy Tonet: I just want to follow-up on Waha a little bit here, and I'm just wondering if you guys have any plans for managing the basis risk there, any differently that comes through in your pop exposure? And just wondering if you have any thoughts as far how long the basis could be wide before it maybe tightens up again.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes. I probably won't be the best expert on how long it's going to be wide before it tightens up again. We are not managing our Waha basis risk differently than we have in the past. We do hedge a portion of our commodity - equity commodity risk, as you know, and Matt gave you the updates. When the gas portion of that hedge is Waha-based, we hedge it as Waha. We try to do so with discipline and without a view of when is the right time to hedge Waha. When we think about more broadly managing that risk, it's trying to see the needs over time for interconnectivity for our assets. And in reality, our assets will mostly get market price. It's good for producers. It's good for G&P operators such as ourselves to improve takeaway from the Permian. And the large basis that you're seeing now, and it probably gets larger before it gets smaller, will help eliminate that basis, because it will incent capital investment for the takeaway. And you can say that broadly across all three commodities.
Jeremy Tonet: That makes sense. Just wanted to touch as well on some of the one-off costs that you guys mentioned in the Logistics and Marketing segment. If you could provide a little bit more color there, that would be helpful.
Matthew Meloy: Yes, Jeremy. We had - as we went through the higher OpEx, it was multiple items. So we kind of lumped it into a maintenance category and other things. It was multiple business unit, multiple items that just kind of stacked up in the first quarter. Sometimes these maintenance repair items can be lumpy. Just a disproportionate amount kind of hit this first quarter. So that's really what drove the higher OpEx on the downstream side. And then on the Gathering and Processing side, the higher OpEx was more related to the additional activity, specifically in the Permian Basin. So that was more kind of more expected and more normal course.
Jeremy Tonet: Got you. Great. And then in Logistics and Marketing as well, could you provide any color as far as - how much of Q1's export margin decline was driven by dock fees relative to kind of commodity margins? If dock margin stay stable from here, can commodity margins expand? Or any color there would be great.
Matthew Meloy: Jeremy, I'm not sure I'm following exactly the question. I'll just say when we export, it's a fee business, right? So we charge a terminal fee to move the product across our dock.
Jeremy Tonet: Okay. I guess, it's just kind of a steady run rate as far as the fee level that we would expect in the export side?
Scott Pryor: Yes, I would say somewhat steady, just recognizing that anything that we move across our dock in a given quarter is both a mixture of term contracts as well as spot activity. So as a result of that, when we're in a situation like we are today where the market is not as robust as it has been in previous years, spot activity across our dock is - with the margin compression on that spot number impacts. Again, with LPG export demand growing globally, we will be in a position to meet incremental opportunities across our dock, and we should improve with that. But again, it's all going to be dependent upon how the market dynamics play out over time.
Jeremy Tonet: Got you. And then maybe just clarifying a little bit. If you guys - you supply the product for the export as well. Just wondering, any commodity margin there? Is this kind of a steady rate? Or do you expect that to kind of alter a bit?
Scott Pryor: I think a steady rate, again recognizing that when you think about the connectivity we have with our upstream side of the business, Pat and his team are keeping our team on the downstream side very busy with all of their growth. And that just enhances our downstream business overall. So a leading - with some of the - I guess, comment that Joe Bob and team provided today, again one of the reasons why we see second half of the year looking better as we move throughout the year.
Jeremy Tonet: Great. That's all helpful. Thank you very much.
Matthew Meloy: Okay. Thanks, Jeremy.
Operator: And our next session comes from TJ Schultz from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
TJ Schultz: Great. Thank you. Joe Bob, you mentioned the Johnson plant will be on just two quarters after the Joyce plant, if I got that right. And you all mentioned a couple of times this morning that there are likely needs for infrastructure in 2019. So is that pace of a plant every six months what is needed to meet your producer needs as you sit there today?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes. I was afraid might extrapolate it, and I knew the question was coming. If you look at the previous two data points, you go back to Buffalo, which we put in the second quarter of 2016, we then put in Benedum, the Midkiff expansion happened in the first part of this year and Joyce coming on in the first quarter-ish of 2018, that was a pretty extended period of time. But May of 2016 was also the lowest rig rate - the lowest number of rigs in the Permian in quite some time. That's a pretty rapid ramp-up. We're going to build them in time to take care of the needs of our important partner, Pioneer, where we get great information. And the Pioneer look-alikes, who are doing as well as they are, in the area. I don't have a prediction for you on how quick the next one will come. But you can be assured we are looking with our high beams, we're comparing all of the producer forecasts and activity levels. And I would say today, best information I've got, is that each successive well continues to be a little bit better than the last one. So I'd just say stay tuned. We're going to be - we're able to be efficient with our capital. All of our plants can run a little bit more than the official nameplate 200 million a day. And the interconnectivity of the systems, the - call it, the more toy plants that we have acquired and adopted and restarted, all give us some flexibility on trying to manage the exact point in time that a plant has to be ready. If you look over on the Western side of the Permian, the Wildcat plant, now that's 250 million a day plant. [Periodicity from it] [ph], that's our first scale plant, but we had to shove in the Oahu plant to kind of take care of initial business. We owned it. It fit well there. It was a good bridge solution, but it doesn't take very long to fill up the 60 million a day. I know that's not as precise a formula as many of the people on the phone might like, but it really is the best answer I can give you right now.
TJ Schultz: Okay. No, that's helpful. And what kind of range on the oil price keeps your view of the activity ramp intact? Or how do you feel from your seat the producers are looking at it? I mean, does your view or expectations in the Permian change at $40 to $45 crude versus something range-bound around, say $55?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes. You - we prepared that one intentionally in our comments. When you look back at my script, I think I say range-bound that today's forward script, or range-bound around today's levels. Our feeling and our view is, by its very nature, the latest conversations we've had with our producers, is a function of that. And in the Permian Basin, it's pretty darn robust at that. In the Bakken, at that, you were hearing the color we were giving you, which was positive. It's harder to say, where do producers field and I think you said $40 to $45. We're not in $40 to $45 now. But we kind of went through it with activity increasing, before we were in the $50 range. I think we're positive here. Positive around here. Positive with the forward curve. I can't tell you what the downward piece looks like other than to say, certainly, in the Permian basin, I read the same stuff you all do. I hear the same stuff that you hear from, for example, Pioneer and I probably hear a little more that's not inconsistent with it. So I'm not going to turn suddenly bearish at $40 to $45.
TJ Schultz: Okay. No, that's helpful. Just one last thing, switching gears a bit. As you look at more activity potentially in the Eagle Ford, you have Raptor ramping. What are your options for optimizing the remaining open capacity that you have in the basin, and I guess, would you consider additional JVs on some of that capacity to drive more volume?
Joe Bob Perkins: In some ways, South Texas has been a consolidating basin. And I think we've worked with that in mind. Our partnership with Sanchez is a very good one and has the benefit of working with one of the - the best operator in the basin, and one of the few that is growing. That's all positive. And we keep our eyes out for what's the best way to manage the available capacity in our hands, and we're watching the consolidation that's going on around us.
TJ Schultz: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Matthew Meloy: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Vikram Bagri from Citi. Your line is now open.
Vikram Bagri: Good afternoon. First on G&P, the increase in gathering infrastructure spending in the Permian, is that driven more by crude or gas gathering? And also if you can provide any color on expected increase in crude gathering capacity post the spending in 2017? Or any other way you can help us understand how big crude gathering opportunity can be for TRGP?
Matthew Meloy: Yes, and - so in that other bucket for both Midland and the Delaware, there's a piece of that that is crude-related. But majority of that is related or natural gas gathering and processing infrastructure. It's adding pipelines, compression and the like. But there's a piece of that that is related to crude.
Vikram Bagri: So the existing capacity, 40,000 barrels a day, each on Delaware and Midland side, how long can you - how long do you think you can use that capacity? And when you think you reach the high utilization on that capacity when you need more?
Matthew Meloy: Yes, we're seeing significant growth in the crude gathered volumes out there. If you look at it right now, that's 27,000 barrels versus - we have still remaining capacity in both Delaware and the Midland, but with activity around those systems, we're going to put in some additional infrastructure to handle that. We don't have any specifics or anything announced on this call, we'll be discussing, but as we kind of work through plans with producers, there may be something large enough there that we would break out in a subsequent call.
Vikram Bagri: Okay. And then Scott, given propane inventories, can you comment on LPG supply demand dynamic in the U.S.? And how is it affecting your ability to contract the un-contracted export capacity? Are you seeing any slowdown in discussions to contract additional capacity? Or the lower terminals fees are offsetting some of that?
Scott Pryor: Propane inventory is, obviously, people have a keen eye on the inventories. What I would suggest is, is that the global market, along with the U.S. market, works pretty efficiently to balance itself out. And here at Targa, we will continue to be focused in on the linkage that we have with our upstream G&P group in and through our assets for deliveries to end markets, whether those would be petrochemical markets or other end-user markets here domestically as well as what we are shipping across our dock. Again, the market will balance itself out, and we'll watch patiently as we move throughout the summer to see how the inventory fluctuates throughout the season.
Vikram Bagri: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Matthew Phillips from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open.
Matthew Phillips: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
Matthew Meloy: Hey, good morning.
Matthew Phillips: Follow-up on the downstream segment. So over the last couple of quarters, fractionation volumes have been pretty flat. Export volumes have been at high levels. I mean, how should I think about the link between those two? I mean, should - given the margins were compressed this quarter on marketing, I mean, was there not the opportunity to run the fracs at higher level to provide these barrels? Or were you all having to buy them in the open market? I mean, what is - how should I think about the link between those two assets?
Matthew Meloy: Scott, you want me to do it?
Scott Pryor: Matt, and I are trying to jump, but you want to add something first?
Matthew Meloy: I guess I'll start maybe just generally, Scott, and then maybe you can get more specific. I think of the linkage between those two over the long-term rather than the short-term. Over the long-term, as Y-grade increases at both our facilities and volumes going through our frac, there's going to be more available for export both at our facilities and at other facilities. So growing supply overall is good thing for the export business. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, what's going through our fractionation facilities is driven by production out in the field. I wouldn't think of it as a demand pull from worldwide LPG, what we run through our fractionators.
Matthew Phillips: Yes. Perfect.
Scott Pryor: Yes, the only other thing I would add is, is that when you look at the volumes through the frac, recognizing that we're still somewhat in a few areas of ethane rejection. So as ethane recovery comes on, that could have some minor impacts to us. But really, the way we look at it is, what's the overall growth in Y-grade production from upstream. And again, with our growth on the upstream side, that - we are set to benefit from all of that.
Matthew Phillips: Yes. I mean, to that point, I mean, utilization has been in the high 60s for the past few quarters. I mean, Joe Bob has discussed a new frac at Mont Belvieu for the past couple of quarters. I mean, so clearly, you're optimistic about volumes there. I mean, how should we think about when they should start to pick up, especially as ethane recovery increases?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, I mean, there you do have demand pull. Ethane pull from the new petchems will create demand, and there will be more ethane [indiscernible] ethane instead of methane, that is a demand pull. The propane going into Y-grade is coming with the E&P production development. So demand pull in ethane. E&P supply driven on propane, and we will build a frac at the right time to meet those volume needs. I'm not saying anything else about that. No one's crystal ball is perfect in terms of what activity in the Permian, the SCOOP, STACK and elsewhere driving at the Mont Belvieu is going to be. But we have pretty good visibility on it. And I would continue to say that Train 6 is a question of when, not if. And if activity levels continue as they are currently, we've got the permit in hand, and we'll announce when we start spending dollars on it.
Matthew Phillips: Yes, I think before, you'd said from groundbreaking to in-service would be about a year. Is that correct?
Joe Bob Perkins: That's not a bad round number.
Matthew Phillips: Okay. Thank you.
Matthew Meloy: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Andrew Weisel from Macquarie Research. Your line is now open.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hey, Andrew.
Andrew Weisel: Hello, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in after the hour. You alluded to some of this, but I want to be a little more clear. The new processing plants you announced today, was that a function more of demand you're anticipating from third-party producers? Or more opportunity for you to use it for equity volumes? And on a related note, are you trying to get ahead of longer-term demand on some of these projects? Or is it where you expect demand to be a year or so from now when they come online?
Joe Bob Perkins: Kind of a little of all of that. The Johnson plant in West Texas, which is coming on six months after the Joyce plant, is absolutely necessary to just handle our contracted volumes, Pioneer and others in the area, but we're still adding dedications, but we've got better visibility on the stuff already in hand than what we don't have. Similarly, we need the Wildcat plant both for activity in the southern part of Versado and the northern part of Sand Hills, but also to meet the needs of the recently acquired Delaware positions. So you were saying - when you say equity volumes, recognizing that equity volumes are only a portion of the volumes that we're handling for our producer customers' needs, those plants are necessary for our producer customer needs and then some future producer customers as well. But this is getting ahead of demand. Yes, I guess a little bit. I think we said on the last call that, when you bring a new plant up in West Texas, because we've got the other ones up so full, okay, above their name-plant, that they start up day one something like - this isn't a perfect prediction, but something like 50% full. And with current activity levels, it doesn't take long before we need another one, six months, in this case. Does that help?
Andrew Weisel: Thanks. That's very helpful. Yes. Thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay, nice talking to you, Andrew.
Andrew Weisel: My other question, actually, your producer JV partner made some comments on the call this morning about you restarting or repurposing some previously mothballed plants in West Texas. I know you recently restarted the Benedum plant and added capacity at Midkiff. Could there be more to come or were they basically referring to prior stuff and these new greenfield plants will be instead of repurposing older things?
Joe Bob Perkins: Unfortunately, preparing for this I didn't hear it. And I'll read the transcript afterwards. We communicate on an IR-to-IR basis, pretty darn well. I believe and I shouldn't be the spokesman for them, I believe they were referring to Midkiff and Benedum in saying that they were glad that those were brought up because otherwise, the Johnson plant wouldn't be owned in time enough. It's helped us get to when the Joyce plant needed to be in time. It provided a little bit more buffer. Now, what also provides a little bit more buffer is we've done a really good job connecting the WestTX system to the rest of the Targa system. And it allows offloads and sometimes on-loads, that provides cushion, shock absorbers to the filling up around that area. I imagine that's what they were talking about. The only other non-operating plant in the entire Targa system that I can think of is in SAOU and it's 60 million a day.
Andrew Weisel: Great, very helpful. Thank you.
Matthew Meloy: Okay. Thanks.
Joe Bob Perkins: Don't forget about that one.
Operator: And our next question comes from Timm Schneider from Evercore. Your line is now open.
Timm Schneider: Yeah, good morning, guys.
Matthew Meloy: Hey, good morning.
Timm Schneider: First question is to follow-up on that OpEx item. From a modeling perspective, how should we kind of model that going forward? I guess, it's going to be - I understand it's lumpy, but is it going to decline from what we saw in Q1?
Matthew Meloy: Yes, I wouldn't expect it to just to take Q1 in run rate. We should see some lower OpEx than that, although it is a little bit difficult to predict exactly what's going to show up in Q2 versus Q3 or Q4. But I think that's right.
Timm Schneider: And the other question I had on the LPG side. As you guys are kind of going out there and looking at counterparties, where is most of the incremental coming from? I know historically you ship a lot of stuff to Latin America, which I - assuming is mostly commercial-residential, so it'd be pricing elastic. But is it Asia, is it Europe, where is most of the incremental interest?
Scott Pryor: The story is predominantly centered around Asia.
Timm Schneider: Okay. And, is that Chinese PDH facilities or large integrated crackers that are kind of being built? I think Formosa is building one. There are a couple of others.
Scott Pryor: It's a combination of both domestic demand as well as PDHs and, obviously, petrochemical expansions.
Timm Schneider: Okay. All right, that's it for me, thank you.
Matthew Meloy: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jerren Holder from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jerren Holder: Thanks, good morning. I know it's late. Can you - I mean, it was the decline in EBITDA from fourth quarter to first quarter, I recognize there's some - operating expenses are higher. It looks like fuel G&P operating income is higher. And so I guess that's why there have been some questions focusing on Downstream and what's happening there. And if I just look on a either year-over-year basis or quarter-over-quarter we still have gross margin being down $15 million. It sounds like fractionation was slightly higher, maybe exports was slightly lower with higher volumes being offset by the lower margins. And so, is it just you guys had a bad quarter for like wholesale marketing distribution? Is that how we should think about it?
Matthew Meloy: I mean, that's one of the factors, but it is lower exports. There was some lower margins on the wholesale side as well. But it's also higher OpEx. I mean, those are the kind of largest items that drove Logistics and Marketing lower either year-over-year or if you look quarter-to-quarter.
Jerren Holder: Yes. Because I guess, on the gross margin side, it's still material, but okay. Anyway, beyond that, from a financing perspective, it's good to see, I guess, additional growth CapEx. And, obviously, you guys are willing to use the ATM. How should we think about the leverage range, just given the incremental spending and, of course, the earn-out payments? How high of leverage are you guys willing to let that run before you sort of use ATM to keep things in check?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. I think we'll continue to use the ATM to fund equity portion of our growth capital. I think we'll continue to over-equitize our growth CapEx to our historical 50% debt, 50% equity. I think we'll continue to run over that. As we see one significant remaining CapEx to be spent this year, but also likely growing capital expenditures, we're going to want to stay ahead of that. When you look at our leverage, our compliance at TRP was 3.6 times. We've had a 3 to 4 times range, or target range for really since the Targa partnership went public. So we are comfortably within that zone. But we're also, if you look at the reported leverage, it's about 4.4 times. I think over time we're going to want to roll that down lower than that. So I think that's going to keep us continuing to fund our growth CapEx likely over the 50% for the near term.
Jerren Holder: Okay. Thank you.
Matthew Meloy: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question is from Ethan Bellamy from Baird. Your line is now open.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hi, Ethan. I think this will be our last question. What can we do for you?
Ethan Bellamy: Lucky me. Thank you for squeezing me in, I appreciate it. So coastal NGL volumes dropped 20% from the fourth quarter. Is that natural declines, and is that trajectory likely to continue, or is that somehow anomalous?
Joe Bob Perkins: Coastal, which, for the most part, is catching offshore Gulf of Mexico and Southwest Louisiana E&P activity has been on a decline, with not a whole lot of activity. It's nice that we get the benefit of some of the big deepwater projects that continue such as the Mars B-Type stuff. And we've got the best catchers mitt. I'll remind everyone to look more at the NGLs than the natural gas inlet. That's where we get our percent of proceeds. And let's say, it has more option value than immediate growth potential right now.
Matthew Meloy: And there was an - and also, there was an operational uplift [ph]. Okay. on the tailgate of VESCO [ph]during the first quarter. So going forward, I'd expect, as - inlet volumes to decline, the NGLs to decline. But there was an operational upset which made that even larger this quarter.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay. It was not our upset we were impacted by.
Matthew Meloy: It was a third-party NGL line.
Ethan Bellamy: And how much would that be? Just so we can get sort of the trajectory right on modeling that.
Matthew Meloy: Yes. I would expect the produced GPM to be similar going forward. So you can look at what the delta was and the inlet decline versus what was produced.
Ethan Bellamy: Okay. And then just, Joe Bob, just one kind of big-picture question, are you done with M&A for the meantime, having your hands full on integration?
Joe Bob Perkins: Well, first of all, I'm really, really fond of integration. I would say that, at this point in time, you wouldn't find anyone in the Targa side, except perhaps a couple of abused accountants, saying that they had their hands full with integration. I think it's working, okay? The operations folks are already Targa folks. It's been integrated into our operations. People are working well together. The communication across the businesses, this one has gone quickly and good. With respect to M&A, we look a lot. You can see our plate is pretty full on the organic growth opportunities in and around our assets. And that's our favorite work. If you put another deal like the recently closed Permian acquisition on the table right now, though, I would hit that button at that price, at that value, bolt it onto the Midland and bolt it onto the Delaware. I think I said, it was the banker bringing a book around, I'd say, just bring me another one of those, and we'll keep it.
Ethan Bellamy: Got it. That's pretty helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: And at this time, I'm showing no further questions.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you very much, operator. We appreciate your time. We know it ran long. If you have any other questions, please give Sanjay or Jen a call. And have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. And this does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Targa Resource Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call maybe recorded I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Jennifer Kneale, Vice President of Finance. Ma'am, you may begin.
Jennifer Kneale: Thank you, Chanel. I'd like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2016 investor call for Targa Resources Corp. Before we get started, I'd like to mention that Targa Resources Corp., Targa, TRC or the company has published its earnings release, and an updated investor presentation which are available on our website www.targaresources.com. Any statements made during this call that might include the company's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Act of 1933 and 1934. Please note that actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings including the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Pat McDonie, EVP of Southern Field Gathering and Processing; Danny Middlebrooks, EVP of Northern Field Gathering and Processing, our North Dakota position and Scott Pryor, EVP of Logistics and Marketing our downstream business, will be joining Joe Bob Perkins, CEO and Matt Meloy, CFO in our scripted remarks. Joe Bob will begin the call and will then turn it over to Matt for discuss fourth quarter and full year 2016 results, and then Pat, Danny and Scott will discuss their business areas in that order. After closing remarks from Joe Bob we will then open the call up to questions. With that, I'll turn the coal call over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Jen. Good morning, and thanks to everyone for joining. As we wrap up 2016 reporting, we are also going to try to cover our current expectations for 2017, including the discussion of the industry trends and activities that are driving those expectations. We spent much of 2015 and 2016 taking some very important steps to position Targa for success across a range of commodity price environments. And now that we are fueling some commodity price stability at levels of support, customer activity and volumes, we believe that Targa has a very positive outlook for 2017 and beyond. That positive outlook is highlighted by, first, a strong interconnected Targa Permian footprint was significant exposure to both Midland and Delaware activity, both of which are augmented by our recent acquisition announced on January 23rd. Secondly, Targa assets in both the STACK and SCOOP, where we are seeing activity levels increase, then positions in other E&P basin where Targa volumes are likely to outperform overall basin levels due to the strength of our asset position and due to the quality producers that we are serving. As evidenced by our Eagle and Bakken activities, for example. And of course, our Targa downstream infrastructure poised to benefit from some of the changing domestic and global market dynamics, especially as world-class PetChem crackers come online on the Golf Coast later this year and next year. And across all of our businesses where Targa commercial operations in future potential growth opportunities are supported by attractive partnerships, mutually beneficial customer relationships, a strong balance sheet, demonstrated access to capital markets and a loyal and talented workforce. 2017 is off to an exciting start for us at Targa, highlighted by the announcement on January 23rd that we were acquiring very nicely fitting additional assets in the Delaware and Midland basins for $565 million, plus performance contingent future payments. And at the same time as the acquisition announcement, we did a concurrent oversubscribed equity offering that raised approximately $525 million of net proceeds, after an immediate upsizing and exercise of the underwriters’ greenshoe. Based on the success of the equity offering and the feedback that we received from investors since January 23, the broad market seems to appreciate that for Targa this is an incredible strategic and operational fit, an accretive transaction derisked through the earnout structure where the ultimate consideration is driven by performance that also benefits Targa shareholders. We are essentially bolting these assets into our existing systems, benefiting from capital efficiencies and from operational and commercial synergies and I would add benefiting from higher EBITDA margins than what some external audiences may perceive or extrapolate relative to historical averages on our existing assets in the Permian. Assuming the acquisition closes in the near term, we plan to then quickly proceed with a 60 million cubic feet per day plant in Pecos County on the southern end of the acquired Delaware basin assets. And as mentioned on our call announcing the acquisition, post close, we would also anticipate quickly connecting the acquired Delaware basin assets to our Sand Hills system in the acquired Midland basin assets to our WestTX system. Subject to HSR approval and other closing conditions, we expect the first quarter close and hope and believe that it will be sooner rather than later. So let's move to discussing our 2017 growth CapEx and operations guidance. What I'm going to take you through at a high level and then Pat, Danny and Scott will repeat some of those expectations and guidance and give you additional color later in the call, Matt will also provide some financial guidance and additional explanation during his prepared remarks. For 2017 we currently expect net growth capital spending of at least $700 million. We recently posted an updated investor date that for this call, you can access it on our web and on page 11 of that presentation we highlight growth capital spending for the year. Let me, first focus on four major projects, spread across the table, the 200 million cubic feet per day Joyce plant in West Texas, the 60 million cubic feet per day plant in the Delaware basin that we will move forward with after we close the acquisition, the Raptor plant in South Texas, which we recently decided with our JV partner Sanchez to expand before it is completed, from 200 million cubic feet per day to 260 million cubic feet per day and the 35,000 barrel per day crude and condensate splitter at Channelview. Although you won't see the subtotal on the table, those four major projects make up approximately $210 million of the quantified 2017 growth capital spending of at least $700 million. Given the producer activity we are now seeing in many of our G&P areas, we currently also expect to spend at least another $400 million across our gathering and processing footprint, related to identified projects that individually are each relatively small. Of course, this spending is somewhat dependent on activity levels, and it will occur primarily in the target systems where we are forecasting volume growth for the year. Downstream, we have a similar group of smaller identified growth CapEx projects, currently totaling approximately $90 million with attractive returns that are primarily associated with Mont Belvieu. As you probably anticipate there are other attractive G&P and downstream projects currently under development, but not yet announced, that may lead to additional growth CapEx spending in 2017. On our third quarter call in early November, I said that our then current expectation was for a similar or likely higher level of growth CapEx spending in 2017, relative to what at the time was $525 million of growth CapEx guidance for 2016. But that we would wait until this call to provide better quantified guidance. I guess today's call confirms that the likely higher color previously provided is correct, driven by a combination of factors, such as, a portion of our growth CapEx spending expected in 2016 was pushed into 2017, and at this point in February we have somewhat improved visibility on producer activity and expectations for the remainder of 2017 and the additional infrastructure needs and opportunities that that expectation provides. We have had a chance to refine our initial view of integrated infrastructure spend around the acquired Delaware and Midland systems. And we have also improved our initial view of additional infrastructure to support the Targa downstream business. These highlighted capital expenditures are the result of and will support and benefit from the activity and resulting expected volumes we are currently experiencing around our systems. Of course, additional work in improving outlook could result in additional opportunities and/or additional announced projects. Now let's shift to our current outlook for Targa field G&P volumes. Sitting now in the middle of February 2017, we expect Targa's average 2017 Permian Basin, natural gas Inlet volumes to be approximately 20% higher than average 2016 volumes, driven by activity and expected volume increases for Targa assets in both the Midland and Delaware basins, in both South Texas and the Badlands, we estimate 2017 average natural gas Inlet volumes will be higher than average 2016 volumes. And we also expect higher average crude volumes in the Badlands year-over-year. These volume increases that I just mentioned will be partially offset by lower volumes in WestOK, SouthOK and North Texas in 2017 compared to 2016. However, with the overall Targa field G&P growth driven by the Permian, South Texas and the Badlands, we expect at least 10% growth in our overall field G&P Inlet volumes in 2017 compared to 2016. With respect to the downstream, almost everyone on the call knows that we spend a lot of time in 2016 discussing LPG exports, with investors, potential investors and sell side analysts. We believe providing helpful industry color, but not disclosing new information about our contract portfolio. This morning after considerable internal deliberation and still in the context of not wanting to disclose more than is competitively appropriate from a business competition viewpoint we're going to provide you with another rare snapshot of our long-term LPG export contracts. We believe this snapshot is consistent with what we have been saying and is consistent with the likely impressions among our customers, potential customers and our competitors and it is reflective of our commercial team’s long time ongoing successful efforts around the globe, ever since we became a significant exporter of LPGs. So currently we have approximately two thirds of our current estimated export capacity of 7 million barrels per month term contracted each year at attractive rates through 2022. Now, some years are slightly higher and some years are slightly lower than two thirds, but two thirds of 7 million barrels per month is representative of the volumes contracted in each year through 2022. There has been and will continue to be an active ongoing contract portfolio management process. Just as we've often repeated, adding and extending contracts as we go forward over time, this rare snapshot updates our continued success. However, today's updated snapshot should not imply any Targa willingness for a continuous, our ongoing public update to such information. I am looking across the table at Scott and he's grinning at me. So that’s about as much as you're going to get out of us even in extended Q&A. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.
Matt Meloy: All right. Thanks, Joe Bob. I will begin by discussing our fourth quarter results and will provide some 2017 financial guidance as I move through my remarks. Targa's reported adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was about $298 million, which as anticipated by remarks on our third quarter call was the highest quarter of 2016. Strong fourth quarter results were due largely to continued growth in our Permian G&P assets and strong performance in our downstream business, which included the partial recognition the approximately $40 million payment received from Noble i in October. Let's pause briefly to discuss the payments associated with the Noble crude and condensate splitter in a little bit more detail. We received approximately $40 million from Noble in October 2016, and the entirety is included in destructible cash flow for the fourth quarter. The contribution to adjusted EBITDA will be amortized over four quarters beginning in the quarter received, so for the fourth of 2016 approximately $10 million of adjusted EBITDA was recognized. A full explanation of our treatment of the splitter payment can be found on slide 38 of the investor presentation that was recently posted to our website this morning. Reported net maintenance capital expenditures were $28 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and total net maintenance CapEx for 2015 was approximately $80 million. We currently expect approximately $110 million of net maintenance capital for 2007. Turning now to our segment level results, I'll go over our performance for the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis. For the gathering and processing segment, reported operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased by 21% compared to last year, primarily due to higher commodity prices, and higher Inlet volumes in the Permian basin with overall field G&P Inlet volumes relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. NGL prices were 45% higher, natural gas prices were 31% higher, and condensate prices were 20% higher, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Fourth quarter reported 2016 natural gas Inlet volumes of 2.5 billion cubic feet per day were approximately flat compared to fourth quarter last year. For year-over-year quarters, we saw an increase in volumes in WestTX, SOU, SouthTX and Versado, offset by lower volumes in WestOK, SouthOK, and North Texas, Sand Hills and Badlands. Note that the bright spot of the SCOOP and STACK activity in Oklahoma did not fully offset other Oklahoma declines. Crude oil gathered was 104,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter, down approximately 5% versus the same time period last year and essentially flat compared to the third quarter of 2016, primarily due to the timing of producer well completion and shut-ins to protect surrounding wells during fracing and also impacted by very severe December weather, whereas the East and West Coast were warmer relative to historic norms, North Dakota third the third coldest winter recorded in its history. Moving to the downstream business. Fourth quarter reported operating margin declined 8%, primarily due to lower LPG export margin, partially offset by higher marketing gains, higher fractionation margin, and higher trading volumes. Fractionation margin increased primarily due to higher fees and favorable system product gains, partially offset by lower volumes which declined approximately 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily as a result of some lower margin contracts rolling off. Now, let's discuss our capital structure and liquidity. As we mentioned in our last earnings call, the series A and series B warrants associated with the billion dollars Series A preferred stock issuance completed in March 2016 became exercisable on September 16, 20160. At this point, almost all of the warrants have been exercised, which we elected to net share or settle, resulting in the issuance of approximately 11.3 million shares, less than 1% of the warrants remain outstanding. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we issued $1 billion of senior notes at attractive rate using the proceeds to successfully complete concurrent tender offers on some of our near-term senior notes. We also extended on our TRP revolver - extended the maturity on our TRP revolver and accounts receivable facility. Looking forward, we have no significant near-term debt maturity concerns and have an attractive debt maturity profile that we will be continuing to manage over time. As of December 31, we had only 150 million outstanding under TRP's 1.6 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due October 2020. On a debt compliance basis, TRPs leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 3.8 times versus a compliance covenant of 5.5 times. We also had borrowings of $275 million under our accounts receivable securitization facility at quarter end. TRP revolver availability at quarter end was over $1.4 billion. As of December 31, TRC had $275 million of borrowings outstanding under our $670 million senior secured credit facility that matures in February 2020 and the balance on TRC's term loan facility that matures in February 2022 was $160 million, both flat to the September 30 balances. TRC revolver availability at quarter end was approximately $395 million, including approximately $70 million in cash, total Targa liquidity at quarter end was approximately $1.9 billion. On the equity side, we continue to utilize our ATM during 2016 and for the year issued approximately $575 million of equity through ATM program. We expect to continue to utilize the ATM program to fund growth CapEx in 2017 and may fund growth CapEx with a higher percentage of equity than our traditional 50% debt and50% equity ratio. Given our consolidated reported debt to EBITDA ratio is approximately 4.6 times. Ideally our long-term target consolidated reported leverage ratio is also approximately 3 to 4 times. However, we are comfortable at our current leverage level, particularly given there is no consolidated debt covenant test at the TRC level, and because we expect EBITDA growth looking forward, which will reduce our leverage ratio. As Joe Bob mentioned earlier, concurrent with the acquisition that we announced in January, we issued 9.2 million shares and raised approximately 525 million of net proceeds, which along with cash on hand and revolver availability will be used to fund the initial acquisition consideration of $565 million. Turning now to hedges, given higher commodity prices in the fourth quarter of 2016, we entered into some additional swaps to hedge some of our gathering and processing equity volume commodity exposure. We added some calendar 2017 through 2019 natural gas, ethane, propane, butane, gasoline and crude swaps and also added some additional calendar 2017 slots. As a result, as of December 31, 2016, for non-fee-based operating margin relative to the partnerships current estimate of equity volumes from field gathering and processing, we estimate that we have hedged approximately 75% of 2017 natural gas, 65% of 2017 condensate and approximately 50% of 2017 NGL volumes. Before handing the call over to Pat, I want to discuss a couple of items related to our Permian acquisition and also provide our estimated 2017 dividend coverage. Even given the increase in commodity prices, incorporating the additional depreciation and amortization we expect from the acquired assets and our expected levels of future CapEx, we continue to not expect to be a cash taxpayer for at least five years. For full year 2017, we are estimating dividend coverage in excess of 1.0 times, assuming a $3.64 per common share 2017 dividend. We are starting to get more questions related to dividend growth, so we wanted to provide some color around our current thinking. As we look forward, we see a very constructed industry environment for Targa in 2017 and beyond, in building excess coverage will further support our balance sheet as we continue to pursue growth in and around our asset base. Consistent with past practice, we would expect to build some excess coverage during more favorable parts of the commodity price cycles, which will provide additional cushion during downturns. And with that, I will now hand the call off the Pat for some additional comments about the Southern Field G&P business that he leads. Pat?
Pat McDonie: Thanks, Matt. And good morning, everyone. Looking back on 2016, I am extremely pleased with our performance in the field G&P segment, and more importantly, looking forward, I'm very excited about the opportunities that we see across our outstanding footprint of assets. We have a number of capital projects in progress, which obviously speaks to our expectations and the expectations of our producers for arising activity, which should support build G&P Inlet volume growth that Joe Bob mentioned earlier. In SouthTX, our Raptor plant will be ramping up during the first quarter and will be fully operational in early April. Our JV partner, Sanchez Production Partners and Targa have jointly agreed to spend a limited amount of capital to add compression to increase total plant capacity to 260 million cubic feet a day from the originally planned 200 million cubic feet a day, a high-impact, highly capital efficient expansion feature designed into the plant already under construction. The expansion decision highlights our continuing joint optimism for activity on our system in the Western part of the Eagle Ford. In WestTX, the restart of our Benedum plant is slated for a first quarter 2017 in-service date. The capacity expansion at Midkiff is planned for a second quarter of 2017 in-service date and the new 200 million cubic feet per day Joyce plant is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2018. These projects are on track and demonstrate continued optimism by Pioneer and Targa related to producer activity in the growth of volumes on our WestTXx venture. As also mentioned earlier, given our January acquisition announcement, we expect to connect the acquired assets in Martin County to our WestTX system at the Buffalo plant soon after transaction close. Given the activity levels that we are seeing in the Midland basin, our broader footprint now deeper into Martin Howard and Borden counties, we will likely need additional processing capacity in that area over the relative near-term. While we are not committing to another plant today, there is a strong likelihood that later this year we will be announcing another 200 million cubic feet per day Midland basin, plant starting up in the second half of 2018 that would require some capital to be spent in 2017. In the Delaware basin, assuming the close of the acquisition, as Joe Bob mentioned, we are initially going to add a 60 million cubic feet per day plant in Pecos County to support the activities of producers on the newly acquired southern Delaware assets, similar to the Midland basin and depending on activity levels on the soon to be acquired assets, we are already thinking about the optimal location and timing for the next Delaware plant. Some of you will recall that we announced plans in October 2014 to build a 300 million cubic feet per day Delaware plant, plans that would have likely connected our Versado system and Sand Hills systems. But those plans were ultimately shelved during the downturn, given success in the area the acquisition, and our resulting increased Delaware footprint, we are considering whether the most efficient way to spend capital includes a plan, and infrastructure that connect Versado to the rest of our Permian systems. Producer activity in the area is even higher than expected when we started looking at the acquired assets, which bodes well for continued expansion. Turning to the Mid-Continent, where upstream activity targeting the STACK and SCOOP continues and is increasing. We remain focused on reaching further into these highly economic resource plays. With resource delineation continuing to push STACK activity further northwest as producers test the Merrimack and Osage formations, we are very well positioned to capture additional volumes with minimal incremental capital spent to utilize existing capacity on our WestOK s system. While we have seen some producers with both STACK and SCOOP assets focus more on the STACK, the SCOOP continues to garner significant attention from producers in that area and we are focused on continuing to reach further northwest into Grady County. All of our efforts in G&P are supported by engineering and operations team work across all of our businesses to share lessons and best practices and I am incredibly proud of the efforts of our people in 2016, and so far in 2017. I feel very confident in our forecasted increase in 2017 average field G&P Inlet volumes relative to 2016, and I'm extremely excited about the opportunities that we are currently seeing and the trajectory for beyond 2017 at these current commodity prices. I will now turn the call over to Danny, who leads our commercial efforts in North Dakota for an update on what is often a very cold place. Danny?
Danny Middlebrooks: Thank you, Pat. And good morning all. The end of 2016 was characterized by historical snowfalls in North Dakota, I've heard was the third worst snow event on record for the state. These events created delays with respect to construction activities and production, but will not have a long-term impact and only a minimal impact on fourth quarter activities. On the call - on the last call we updated you that we're mechanically complete on approximately 50% of the 30 mile pipeline project we were building on the Ft. Berthold Indian reservation, and had initial production of 2500 barrels per day flowing at that time. Before stopping during the height of the winter storms, we had initial production of approximately 15,000 barrels per day flowing. We have since resumed construction and are over 97% complete with the expansion with only the tie-ins were about 10 well past to finish. Last February, we provided guidance, we expected average 2016 natural gas volumes to be higher than average 2015 volumes and that we expected crude volumes to be essentially flat, despite the slowdown in activity that was experienced across the basin in 2015 and expecting shut-ins to protect nearby wells during frac For 2016, our Badlands natural gas volumes increased 6% versus 2015, and our crude volumes were down only slightly compared to 2015. During the fourth quarter, we tracked well shut-ins for fracture protection, and we estimate we had approximately 15,000 barrels per day shut-ins by our customers, which coupled with weather created headwinds first in the fourth quarter. Looking forward to the rest of 2017, we continue hear positive indications of research [ph] and likely to increase activity on our dedicated acreage; assuming crude prices stabilize around $55 per barrel. For the Badlands in 2017, we expect average crude and gas volumes to be higher compared to 2016. Giving Targa's attractive per unit margins for both gas and crude oil in the Bakken and available capacity in our Little Missouri plants, we are poised to benefit with any uptick in drilling activity. I'll now turn the call over to Scott Pryor, who leads our downstream business unit. Scott?
Scott Pryor: Thanks, Danny. As most of you know, my team and I lead the downstream business. Starting with LPG exports, 2016 was a really solid year for Targa as we outperformed our guidance for the year, despite some volatile market dynamics. Fourth quarter LPG export volumes were 6.3 million barrels per month, which exceeded the guidance provided on our third quarter earnings call of at least 6 million barrels per month and volumes would have been higher, if not for unseasonable fall delays during the latter part of December. Our fourth quarter LPG export volume performance was a combination of term and spot contracts, which is typical and what you should expect to be the case going forward. Globally, there was an increase in LPG demand during the quarter from places like Indonesia, India, China, Africa and Europe, relative to those market trends, Targa is well positioned to benefit from short-term opportunities and as a part of a longer term contract portfolio management. Vessels leaving our facility continue to move to destinations somewhat consistent with previous quarters, with approximately 64% going to the Americas and 36% to areas such as Europe, Africa and Asia in the fourth quarter of 2016. We did see more cargoes moving to Europe in the fourth quarter, due in large part to the weather and our volumes to the Americas continued to grow, even if the percentage of our overall volume is slightly lower. Our full year 2016 average of 5.5 million barrels per month exceeded the guidance that we provided last February, when we said that we expected to export at least 5 million barrels per month of LPGs. We are particularly proud of our results given some of the global market disruptions in the summer. As previously discussed, those market disruptions had a minimal impact on our facility relative to others, with only three cancellations during the period and none throughout the rest of 2016 for Targa. Our overall 2016 results are supported with a growing presence of Gulf Coast LPG exports on the global waterborne market, and Targa's positioning as an important supplier to a diverse set of customers worldwide. Given the increased competitiveness in the market as a result of additional capacity coming online over the last couple of years, we intentionally play our cards close to the best, believing that there are commercial benefits to being less transparent around contracting. Just as we did in February of 2015 when we last provided you with a snapshot of the status of our contract portfolio, looking out longer than the current year, today, we want to try to remove some of the investor concerns around the term of our contract portfolio. So I want to repeat what Joe Bob said earlier, because it is highly unlikely, I will be convinced to provide any other data points for years. Current, we have approximately two thirds of our current estimated LPG export capacity contracted each year through 2022 at attractive rates, that is about two thirds of 7 million barrels per month for each year through 2022. There are some minor variation from the two thirds figure in individual years. But it's never substantial and it falls in that range year-end and year out and doesn't trend lower over the same timeframe. As always, our marketing efforts in the global export markets continue and there has been and will continue to be an active ongoing contract portfolio management process, whereby we continue to add an extend term contracts as we go forward over time, while complementing the portfolio and the quarterly performance with spot contracts. As we look forward to the rest of 2017 and beyond, the oil driven US E&P activity is expected to increase domestic NGL production, which should solidify the US's position as one of the leading sources of low-cost LPG supply, which given the support we have in accessing volumes from our G&P and fractionation assets positions us well. Globally, we are seeing the positive impact of OPEC production cuts through a tightening of LPG volumes available from the Middle East. This may further highlight the US as the fastest-growing provider of LPG supply to the global market. A distinction the US has held for several years and may hold for several years looking forward. Turning now to our fractionation business. The expected growth in our industry and Targa G&P volumes, with the increasing activity levels in a number of key basin that supply volumes to Mont Belvieu means we are well-positioned given we have fractionation capacity available at our CBF facility. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we had higher fractionation volumes sourced from our of upstream G&P facilities relative to the same period in 2015 and looking forward, see supply and demand catalyst that will certainly benefit Targa. The outlook for increased ethane recovery in 2017 and beyond, driven by growing petrochemical demand from the large-scale PetChem facility scheduled to come online beginning later this year will drive fractionations volumes higher. Overall, increased domestic exploration and production activities will also drive fractionations volumes higher. We had available fractionation capacity today, but if you look at most of the NGL production forecast that have been recently published, Mont Belvieu will need additional fractionation capacity, it’s just a matter of when and not if. While we do not have immediate plans to proceed with Train 6 at Mont Belvieu, that permit is in hand, and it is an example of a project that we will likely move forward with at some point. Lastly, construction continues on a 35,000 barrel per day crude and condensate splitter at Channelview. We anticipate that this splitter will be online and fully operational in first quarter of 2018. Downstream, we are working on a number of other exciting projects. We are constantly looking at how to best maximize our existing infrastructure and to provide solutions for customers here and around the world. We are not in a position to announce any additional downstream projects, but the positive tone around commodity prices and domestic activity levels is fostering discussions about additional infrastructure opportunities, which is a nice change relative to the market tone over the last couple of years. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Scott. We've covered a lot of ground this morning. Let me briefly summarize our new public expectations or quote on quote guidance provided today. For 2017, we expect dividend coverage in excess of one times assuming, a 2017 dividend 364 per common share. We estimate at least $700 million of attractive growth capital spending based on the projects we highlighted and expect $110 million of maintenance capital spending. We expect average 2017 Permian basin volume growth of approximately 20% over average 2016. In the Badlands, we estimate higher crude and gas volumes year-over-year. In South Texas, we estimate higher average Inlet volumes year-over-year and for our overall field G&P Inlet volumes, we expect at least 10% growth in 2017, compared to average 2016. Downstream, we have export services of approximately two thirds of 7 million barrels per month contracted for multiple years, in each of multiple years. With that summary, and our comments today. I hope you have also heard we are optimistic about the current environment. Thanks in large part to our team’s successful navigation of 2015 and 2016 and the activity levels of customers who also successfully navigated such waters. I am so proud of the work of our employees over the last couple years and a lot of my excitement is driven by the enthusiasm that I am hearing from them across the company relative to the opportunities that they are seeing in the market. In conclusion, looking forward to the rest of 2017 and beyond, we have a number of attractive capital projects identified or underway, and expect to see continued opportunities to build out infrastructure around our assets at compelling returns. We are hopefully soon closing an acquisition that knits together very well with our existing assets and provides additional runway for growth in the most active G&P areas in the country. And we are well-positioned with our existing asset footprint to benefit from domestic market themes, such as ethane recovery, increased G&P activity in the best basins AND increased domestic NGL production, these things, combined with Targa positioning and Targa execution should create upside for our investors. So with that operator, please open up the line for questions. Thank you very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Brandon Blossman of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Your line is now open.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning, Brandon.
Brandon Blossman: Hey, good morning.
Matt Meloy: Morning.
Brandon Blossman: I hesitate to ask, but I'm going to do it. LPG recontracting, Joe Bob, I think the term you used was attractive rate. What's the point of comparison for attractive? Is that spot rates, current spot rates, historical contracted rates, something in between, or something else?
Matt Meloy: Brandon, you win, that we did predict that was the first question and we also predicted that Joe Bob wouldn't answer, which is why Scott is going to answer.
Scott Pryor: Brandon, thanks for the question. We did anticipate it to a certain degree. What I would say is, is this that, when we first started our Phase I and Phase II export projects and contracting for those, those were at very, very attractive rates and these attractive rates that we have out there and we are constantly contracting going forward, and we are working our contract portfolio on a term basis regularly. So we are very happy with the rights that we have. You hear a lot of times in the marketplace customers that may be trying to mitigate some of their take-or-pay requirements and you hear what I would refer to as re-trade spot values, that are relatively low rates in my opinion. So these are attractive compared to those types of rates.
Brandon Blossman: Okay, that's actually more than I expected. Thank you, Scott.
Matt Meloy: Because it was Scott instead of Joe Bob, Brandon.
Brandon Blossman: Okay. How about - this is hopefully fairly easy. Frac Train 6, what do you need to see to sanction that project and what's the timeline between sanction and online date?
Joe Bob Perkins: Section is an interesting word. We have said for some time and we realize that, that it’s not a question of it, just a question of when on Train 6. We are not completely fallen the Targa portfolio of Mont Belvieu-based fractionation, but we don't have a whole lot of room, and we are filling up that room primarily based on Targa's increasing equity barrels flowing to our fractionation. We also want to be able to meet the needs of our customers and if we stay at current price levels, there is going to be a need for additional fractionation. From the time we actually break ground on that, you've seen based on our past track record that that can be done in about a year. Can we do a little faster? Sure, if we were and I don't expect this to be the case, kind of a pushing that ends of the contract without renewal process. We might get started and move a little bit slower. But on average from the time we break ground and people would notice it really quickly when we broke ground and probably tell the markets at the same time, you could count on roughly a year.
Brandon Blossman: So, absolutely no risk that it gets too tight at Mont Belvieu? You guys will meet demand as needed?
Joe Bob Perkins: I think there is risk. It gets too tight at Mont Belvieu at some point because it does take time to build these. At the same time Targa in particular has a portfolio that allows us a little bit of tightness relief valve by pushing NGLs to Lake Charles to fractionate on a temporary basis.
Brandon Blossman: Understood. All right, thank you Joe Bob. I'll leave it there.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Jeremy Tonet: Good morning.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hey, good morning.
Jeremy Tonet: I just want to dig in on the Permian a bit more here. And I was wondering if you might be able to provide us what type of - as that ramps, what type of exit rate - kind of if you look at 4Q '17 versus 4Q '16, how that might look, and if there's any color you could provide kind of on same-store sales without Outrigger? Just trying to calibrate our models here? Thanks.
Joe Bob Perkins: Understood, same-store sales is a really interesting question, if take that all the way down to the well, all of the new horizontal wells start up at higher rates, have a fairly rapid first your decline and then that decline slows down. We aren’t about one well at a time. In fact, we hook up entire drilling pads and tank batteries behind - and pads behind existing tank batteries, I would say it’s a multi-store equation, even at the most disaggregated of our connections.
Joe Bob Perkins: And that also makes it capital efficient for our connections. Exit rate for 2016 compared to '17, compared to exit rate 2016 is not granularity we're providing for you right now. And we have multiple forecast, I hope it helps you calibrate your models to look at about 20 - and this is going to be precisely 20, frankly I would take the overall 20% of Targa's Permian in 2017, relative to 2016.
Matt Meloy: And just to add to that Joe Bob, I would say when we look at our growth out on the Permian, we see growth really pretty steady across 2017. I don't know that we've forecasted a big step change in the quarter versus the other. There is variability with when some of our customers connect the wells, so it won't be smooth, but our estimate is for a pretty steady ramp across the year, it’s going to be wrong in any given quarter, but we see continued growth just throughout the year.
Jeremy Tonet: Okay. Matt, I just want to pick up on some of your comments as far as growing coverage, and just wondering if you could tie any numbers in there, kind of how you think about it philosophically as far as what type of coverage or range of coverage would make sense and leverage employees before you thought about dividend growth.
Matt Meloy: Yes, we talk about it, we intentionally left out any kind of number to put in there, but I guess, what I would say is you know, coming out of the environment we were in and looking ahead of the growth opportunities we have, we have $700 million of growth CapEx here which we anticipate to grow significantly. And we're just - with all the opportunities that we have, we want to take care the balance sheet first. So that’s going to be our first priority. A three to four times target ratio for the partnership, we don’t really plan to change that. We think over time we'll get our consolidated into that range. But don't necessarily have to solve for that no right up front. So I think it’s really just priorities for us and our priorities is going to be on taking care of the balance sheet.
Jeremy Tonet: Okay, great. That's helpful. That's it for me, thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Sighinolfi of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hi, Chris.
Chris Sighinolfi: Hey. Good morning, Joe Bob, how are you?
Joe Bob Perkins: Good.
Chris Sighinolfi: I just had a question. I was looking at the slide presentation, and noticed, on the Joyce plant in West Texas, $90 million of spend for the 200 million of gas processing capacity seems very attractive relative to the typical costs we've seen from you and others in the past. So I am just wondering if there's something unique about that facility or something about that region in general that maybe affords it more economic investment on these types of things going forward?
Joe Bob Perkins: You picked up on it. First I'd say I am very, very proud of our engineering group working on different way of approaching these cost and they were able to - you can see it relative to our press events, figure out ways for this to be less costly relative to other 200 million a day plants, built in a different time and a different cost in a slightly way. More importantly we like to thank that we've learned things along the way, a very experienced in building those plants in West Texas and can hold on, capture some of those costs going forward. It would not be fair to - not count the fact that because it's pretty close to another plant we've gained some infrastructure advantages by being close to that plan and every plant comes with associated infrastructure spending and we might have had less on this.
Matt Meloy: And just to add to that Joe Bob, when you look at the all in cost for the plant and related infrastructure it is cheaper than our historical spend for a plant, but that 90 it is also is net, so its 73% interest, so that’s our share of the plant, so the growth is a bit higher than that.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. That's helpful, Matt. But I guess, in relation to Jeremy's question, I think about some of the returns, we should - opportunities like this where you have something located close to an existing asset, you can extract the costing improvement. When you bid that plant out or sell that capacity, we should think - is it incorrect to think that's a better return project, therefore you basically get to capture that cost improvement?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, out of return.
Matt Meloy: Yes, as we're able to reduce the cost and plan and as were adding more plants, we're going to continue to do everything we can to even continue to drive those cost down.
Joe Bob Perkins: I would like add, any plant being added to a multi-plant, interconnected multi-system, set of infrastructure has advantages, cost advantage, asset flexibility advantages, reliability advantages and you are sort of touching over there.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay, great…
Pat McDonie: I think, I would add one more thing too and that is, we are doing it at a lower cost with the same efficiencies and capabilities to process our gas.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. I guess switching gears a little bit, I have two other remaining questions if I could. Matt, first, I guess, on that NGL sensitivity for '17, it looked like it's escalated a touch from what we were sort of seeing for 2016. I'm just wondering what's driving that. It looks like you're more hedged now, so I'm just wondering. Is that net to the sensitivities on hedges or is there a mix shift in the contracts? Any dynamic around maybe what's shaping that would be helpful.
Matt Meloy: Yes, I think that’s likely the volume outlook as we see growth in not only inlet, we're going to see increased NGL production growth too. So we have - we do have some more hedges in place, but then we do have more equity volumes from the growth in our business. So it’s right off of those business.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. And then that's helpful. And then, finally, I guess I remember from the 10-K from last year that you had I think it was the Velma agreement with OneOK in the SouthOK system that was set to expire at the end of the year and you were planning to move that volume on to your own downstream network. I don't think the volumes were ever quantified, but I'm wondering, now that that agreement presumably has expired, if you offer any color on that, maybe what the uplift might be on your own downstream position from that contract expiration.
Matt Meloy: Yes, I mean, we've got a number of different arrangement at different plants and we're always looking to try and get as many volumes as we can through our downstream assets. I don’t recall the term of that exact one that you're referring to. 
Joe Bob Perkins: But across the portfolio.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay, I figured it might've been larger - it was called out.
Joe Bob Perkins: Across the portfolio, Scott is now kicking me under a wide table here. Across the portfolio we are always trying to control more liquids instead of less liquids. You should assume that we're working on that and you should also presume that we're probably not going to dissect it into individual agreements and continue to describe them publicly. There was greater visibility on some of those agreements….
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. I didn't know if those were because they were legacy Atlas or because they were significant in size, but they were denoted, and that's the only reason I brought that one up…
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. Thanks a lot guys.
Matt Meloy: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Darren Horowitz of Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Darren Horowitz: Good morning guys. Regarding the comments that have been made around equity NGL volume exposure, pro forma the Permian acquisition being integrated by the end of the year, you're going to have obviously gathering capacity over 2 Bcf a day, so more rich gas coming across the system through that, and also acres dedications. How much equity barrel or commodity sensitive marketing exposure do you want to have pro forma the assets being integrated? And could it be a situation where the incremental fee-based EBITDA from the organic growth projects grows consistent with that equity NGL exposure such that the amount of margin that's actually exposed still stays around 30%?
Matt Meloy: Yes, it’s good question Darren, we have a mix. So it really does depend on just what growth we see from those assets relative to our legacy assets, and price, the Outrigger acquisition it’s essentially all fee-based, as you recall, so its 98%. We're going to see significant growth. That’s going to be pushing dollar fees higher, so then it’s just really a matter of what happens to commodity prices and our volume that are - on WestTX and other areas where as primarily percentage of proceeds.
Darren Horowitz: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up question on the Permian Basin G&P natural gas inlet volume growth, recognizing that it's really going to start picking up pro forma the asset integration, but I'm just wondering. From a timing and magnitude perspective, how pronounced do you expect the back half of your step change to be? And can you give us at least your preliminary thoughts of where you think, exit 2017, Permian Basin G&P natural gas inlet volumes could be versus day one when those assets are integrated?
Matt Meloy: Yes, it sounds lot like a question we got earlier of the –on the kind of volume ramp. I think as we think about Permian growth across '17, I think we're going to see a steady ramp in volume. At times there are periods where a bunch of compressor stations do come on and we do get some kind of intermediate step changes, but we don't have really good visibility on when those occur, at this second our forecast is for a steady ramp of up of Permian volumes really from kind of now through the end of the year and then continuing into '18.
Joe Bob Perkins: And any individual producer that shut-in wells to protect while they are fracing have had drilling and pad completion, may be more in drilling mode then completion mode at a particular point in time. But those things tend to even out with each other. I don't think even though we analyze it hard and run lots of forecast, I don't really believe we can give you much more color, rather than to say, its steadily increasing, which was perhaps, that’s our expectation, it’s going to be what it’s going to be, but is going to be up into the right. And 20% average to average is pretty nice growth, and we are not trying to imply that we've got one percent positional of that already…
Darren Horowitz: I appreciate that, Joe Bob. And then if I could, just one bigger picture follow-up. And I appreciate the color on this. But when you've outlined the opportunities for example to connect the Delaware system and the Sand Hills and what you're going to do in the Midland with the legacy West Texas assets and also talked about what's going on in Howard and Martin and Borden Counties, where do you see the biggest area of incremental opportunity for you, just from a system leveraging perspective?
Matt Meloy: I think we really - we had phenomenal position in the Midland with our existing assets, and we were kind of pushing into the Delaware's for this acquisition with the Outrigger assets, giving us a really good footprint in the Delaware to grow. I think we feel really good about both the Delaware site in the Midland basin.
Joe Bob Perkins: They are both in a very good category, differentiating among that I don't think it’s particularly helpful. It will be - what the producer is doing, we know what the future looks like, in the Midland we've been there, we see it, we've got partner who is highly communicative with us and we're certainly getting closer to closing and with closing we can have been better communication with producers on the Delaware side.
Darren Horowitz: Thank you very much.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thanks, Darren.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Danilo Juvane of BMO Capital. Your line is now open.
Danilo Juvane: Good morning. Most of my questions have been hit. I did have one quick follow-up. So in the Downstream segment, OpEx picked up I think 10% year-over-year. I think you mentioned the compensation was largely due to that increase. But if you exclude that for 2017, how should we think about OpEx for the Downstream segment?
Matt Meloy: We had a couple of factors hitting OpEx for Downstream, we had the Train 5 coming on and then we also had commodity prices, gas prices move up on a year-over-year, a lot of that OpEx is passed through, the OpEx increases and that’s a variable component to the fee that is passed back to fractionation customer. So part of it just going to depend on where essentially commodity prices are a bit on OpEx' then Train 5 coming on that was the other increase that you saw.
Joe Bob Perkins: But you should not expect particularly years, to years a radical step function of that increase in Train 5 on non-fuel based operating cost that there was also an increase in Train 5 fuel based operating cost.
Danilo Juvane: Okay. That's it for me. Thank you
Matt Meloy: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to management for closing remarks.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you very much operator. And thanks to everyone on the call for the patience with the large amount of ground we covered. And with our admittedly typical reticent on Q&A. We look forward to 2017 and for performing for our investors in 2017 and look forward to the next call, next time we'll be talking to you. In the meantime, feel free to contact Lou, Jen, Matt or any of the rest of us. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Targa Resource Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Jennifer Kneale. You may begin.
Jennifer Kneale: Thank you, Operator. I would like to welcome everyone to our third quarter 2016 investor call for Targa Resources Corp. Before we get started I would like to mention that Targa Resources Corp., Targa, TRC or the company has published its earnings release, which is available on our website at www.targaresources.com. An updated investor presentation will also be posted to our website later today. Any statements made during this call that might include the company's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Act of 1933 and 1934. Please note that actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings including the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. With that, I will turn the coal call over to Joe Bob Perkins.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Jen. Welcome, good morning, and thanks to everyone for joining. This morning I am going to begin the call with some high level remarks, and then we’ll turnover it over to Matt to discuss our results for the third quarter in more detail. We will then hear from our business leaders, Scott Pryor, EVP of Logistics and Marketing, our downstream business; Pat McDonie, EVP of Southern Field Gathering and Processing; and Danny Middlebrooks, EVP of Northern Field Gathering and Processing, our North Dakota position. Scott, Pat, and Danny will discuss some of the trends and dynamics in their areas of operations. I will then finish with some closing remarks, and we’ll open up the call for questions. Well, 2016 has been a roller coaster year. Everyone on the call has been on that roller coaster, so I'll only ask you to recall a couple of things as we report this quarter, reflect on year-over-year results, and look forward. First, as we report third quarter results, we recognize that after a couple of quarters of commodity price improvements, Q3, 2016 natural gas and crude prices were both below the prices of third quarter of 2015, and NGL prices were about $0.03 higher relative to the third quarter of last year. Second, we look back at everything that Targa has accomplished, since the third quarter 2015, relative to our restructuring and the improvement of our balance sheet. And with that perspective in today's environment and looking forward, Targa is certainly well-positioned, and we are looking forward with cautious optimism, given the strength of our asset portfolio and the levels of activity we are seeing and expect to see around our assets. For Targa dividend coverage in the third quarter was 0.9 times, lower than previous quarters this year, largely as a result of reducing operating margin from our LPG export business and the recent exercise of approximately 95% of the warrants associated with the TRC preferred issued in March that Targa elected to net share settle. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was approximately 5% less than the second quarter. However, for the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be higher than the first, second, or third quarters of this year. We say that with the cautious confidence of our November 2 due and visibility because, we expect to load approximately six million barrels per month of LPGs from Galena Park in the fourth quarter. We have already benefited from some appreciation in commodity prices early in the quarter, and because of the known timing of a multi-year annual payment of approximately $40 million received in early October, associated with our long-term contract with Noble, related to the crude and condensate splitter. You will recall that we renegotiated the Noble crude and condensate splitter arrangement at the end of 2014, agreeing to explore other deal alternatives for them for a fee, and at the time set that our original deal economics from March 2014 would not be negatively impacted as a result of revised future contracts that would follow. Because we received the annual payment in early October, the cash will be included in dividend coverage in the fourth quarter. As a result of the previously mentioned factors, we expect dividend coverage to approach 1.2 times for the fourth quarter, and fully expect that we will meet our previously provided 2016 annual dividend coverage guidance of at least one times. For Targa looking forward beyond 2016 in gathering and processing, we expect our field volumes to grow, driven by increasing activity from producers in our most active areas. Areas that are positioned in some of the most economic basins in the world; the Permian, the Bakken, STACK and SCOOP. Current access capacity across much of the target systems will provide near-term margin expansion with minimal capital outlay. And in the heart of the active Midland Basin, we are today, I guess officially announcing another 200 million cubic feet per day plant in our WestTX system, which we expect to be online by year-end 2017. The WestTX system, of course, is our JV with Pioneer Natural Resources, and the new plant will serve their growing volume needs, as well as the growing volume needs of multiple other producers enjoying similar success. In the WestTX system, we are also restarting our 45 million cubic feet per day Benedum plant and 20 million cubic feet per day of capacity at our Midkiff plant. Both of these expansions are expected to be online in the first quarter of 2017. These capacity additions which are all very much needed by the end of year 2017 are excellent examples of our expectations for continued growth in this area of the Permian. We are also working on other attractive G&P projects across our footprint. On the M&A front, we are pleased to announce that on October 31 we executed an agreement with Chevron to acquire their 37% interest in the Versado joint venture, located primarily in southeastern New Mexico, partially in the Delaware Basin. Targa now owns 100% of the Versado system. Net of working capital, the acquisition cost of the 37% Versado interest is not very large, and is included in our current 2016 CapEx estimate of $525 million. The acquisition of the Versado interest is a very good deal, based on our outlook for the system and only 100% of Versado increases our ability to compete and expand further into the Delaware Basin to access new territory. We also will have increased flexibility to connect Versado with our other integrated Permian Basin systems in the future. Given our diversified asset footprint, increasing upstream gathering and processing activity will continue to drive growth for our downstream businesses, as we benefit from additional NGL volumes at our fractionation and export facilities. We will also benefit from greater expected ethane extraction as a result of the world class petrochemical facilities coming online in 2017 and 2018, with increased demand pulling additional volumes to Mont Belvieu. This increased ethane demand and the consequent lower natural gas supply should increase those commodity prices and benefit Targa on the G&P side related to our equity volumes. And our LPG export facility is well positioned, with a demonstrated track record of performance, and it will continue to help clear excess supply of propane and butanes, as domestic NGL production continues to grow without commensurate domestic demand growth, and as the US continues to take a larger market share of the growing global Waterborne NGL market. The combination of our well positioned asset footprint, plus expectations for continued activity and recovery, plus our strong balance sheet and liquidity position causes us to feel like Targa will be an early and continued beneficiary as the industry recovers. Looking forward, we expect to see continued positive catalyst to support our businesses, driving gathering and processing volumes, fractionation volumes, LPG export volumes, and attractive investment opportunities across the Targa platform. With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt to discuss our third quarter results in more detail.
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Joe Bob. Targa's reported adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was 245 million and distributable cash flow was 168 million. Overall reported operating margin was approximately 12% lower, compared to the third quarter last year, and will be discussed in more detail in the segment results in a few moments. Reported net maintenance capital expenditures were 20 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to 24 million in the third quarter of 2015. We expect 90 million or lower of net maintenance CapEx for 2016. Turning to our segment level results, I’ll go over our performance in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. Beginning with the downstream segment, third quarter reported operating margin declined 23%, primarily due to the lower LPG export margin of volumes, lower [terminaling] and storage throughput, lower marketing gains, and the realization in 2015 of contract renegotiation fees related to our crude and condensate splitter project. Fractionation volumes this quarter were lower by approximately 9% compared to the third quarter of 2015, primarily as a result of some lower margin contracts rolling off as we have previously discussed. Downstream segment reported operating expenses increased a modest 2% in the third quarter of 2016 versus the same time period last year, as a result of the addition of Train 5. Turning to the Gathering and Processing segment, reported operating margin for the third quarter 2016 increased by 6% compared to last year, primarily due to higher NGL prices, higher inlet volumes in the Permian Basin, and lower operating expenses. NGL prices were 13% higher. Condensate prices were 6% lower, and natural gas prices were 1% lower compared to the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter reported 2016 natural gas plant inlet volumes for field gathering and processing were slightly under 2.6 billion cubic feet per day. Year-over-year, we saw an increase in volumes in WestTX, SAOU, SouthTX and Badlands offset by lower volumes in WestOK, North Texas, and Sandhills with volumes approximately flat in Versado and SouthOK. We also benefited from a 10% increase in NGL production in the third quarter of 2016, versus the third quarter of 2015. Crude oil gathered was 104,000 barrels per day in the third quarter, down approximately 5% versus the same time period last year and down approximately 1% compared to the second quarter of this year, primarily from producers shutting in production while completing and fracking new wells nearby. Third quarter 2016 Gathering and Processing segment OpEx was 1% lower than third quarter 2015, despite the addition of the Buffalo plant highlighting our continued focus on and continued success in managing costs. Let's now move to capital structure and liquidity. Recently, we took steps to further strengthen our balance sheet, improve liquidity and extend our debt maturity profile. In September, we priced an upsized offering of 1 billion of senior unsecured notes and two tranches, 500 million of 5 1/8 notes due 2025, and 500 million of 5 3/8 notes due in 2027. The proceeds from these offerings along with the TRP revolver borrowings were used to fund concurrent tender offers for three near-term maturities, and we announced in October the early acceptance of 483 million of 5% notes due 2018, 282 million of 6 5/8 notes due 2020 and 374 million of 6 7/8 notes due 2021. Subsequent to the closing of the tender offers we issued notices of full redemption to the trustees and note holders of TRPs 6 5/8 notes and 6 7/8 notes in addition to the 6 5/8 APL notes due October 2020. The aggregate $146 million principal amount outstanding of all three series of notes will be redeemed on November 15, and we expect to use funds drawn from the TRP revolver to redeem the notes, and we now have an enviable debt maturity profile with approximately 76% of our senior notes set to mature in 2022 and beyond. These transactions reflect our continued ability to access the high yield market at attractive terms and reflect investor appetite for Targa [Paper]. During the quarter, we also extended the maturity of our 1.6 billion TRP revolver by three years to October 2020 from October 2017 at substantially similar terms. As of September 30, we had no borrowings under TRPs 1.6 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due October 2020. On a debt compliance basis, TRP's leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was 3.8 times versus a compliance covenant of 5.5 times. Also at quarter end, we had borrowings of 225 million under our accounts receivable securitization facility. As of September 30, TRC had 275 million in borrowings, outstanding under our 670 million senior secured credit facility that matures in February 2020, and the balance on TRC's term loan facility that matures in February 2022 was 160 million. TRC availability at quarter end was approximately 395 million; including 141 million in cash; total Targa liquidity at quarter end was over 2.1 billion. On the equity side, we issued 150 million of equity through our ATM program during the third quarter to be used to fund growth CapEx. Given our third quarter TRC, consolidated debt-to-EBITDA is approximately 4.5 times. We continue to expect to fund growth CapEx looking forward, with a higher percentage of equity than our traditional 50% debt and 50% equity, and will likely use the ATM for any additional equity needs. As a reminder, there is no consolidated debt covenant at the TRC level. On September 16, the series A and series B warrants associated with $1 billion 9.5% series A preferred stock issuance we completed in March 2016 became exercisable. Upon notice of an investors desire to exercise, Targa had the option to either net share settle or net cash settle the differential between the market price and the warrant price. As mentioned by Joe Bob earlier, through the end of October approximately 95% of outstanding warrants have been exercised, resulting in the issuance of approximately 11 million shares. This increase in shares outstanding is the only dilution expected, as a result of the TRC preferred issuance and that dilution is essentially complete. Turning to hedges, for non-fee based operating margin relative to the partnership's current estimate of equity volumes, field gathering and processing, we estimate we have hedged approximately 60% of remaining 2016 natural gas, 55% of remaining 2016 condensate, and approximately 20% of remaining NGL volumes. For 2017 we estimate we have hedged approximately 55% of natural gas, 55% of condensate and approximately 20% of NGL volumes. During the third quarter, we added some calendar 2017 through 2019 natural gas, ethane, propane, crude, and natural gasoline hedges and also some additional ethane hedges in 2017, using a combination of swaps and cashless (inaudible). Our fee-based operating margin for the third quarter 2016 was approximately 79%. Moving on to capital spending, we estimate approximately 525 million for net growth capital expenditures in ‘16 and as mentioned earlier 90 million or less of net maintenance capital expenditures. We are currently working through our planning process and expect to be in a position to provide an improved 2017 growth CapEx estimate on our fourth quarter earnings call. Our current expectation is that we may see a similar level or likely higher of growth capital spending in 2017, as compared to 2016, which as we said earlier is about 525 million. We expect to provide other additional 2017 estimates, including commodity price sensitivities on or before our fourth quarter earnings call. That wraps up my comments, and I will hand it over to Scott to describe some of the trends and the logistics in the marketing business. Scott.
Scott Pryor: Thanks, Matt. Today I will provide some color around the current and forward looking dynamics of two of the key components of Targa's downstream business, LPG exports and fractionation. Overall for 2016, we expect to exceed our long ago stated guidance for monthly LPG volume exports from our Galena Park facility. Since stating it in early 2016, we have not changed our estimate to export at least 5 million barrels per month of LPGs for the year and supported by our visibility for the rest of this quarter, we can estimate with high confidence that we expect to average approximately 5.5 million barrels for the year, driven by strong volume performance in the first, second, and fourth quarters. Consistent with our stated expectations for the third quarter in both script and Q&A from our last earnings call in early August, the third quarter was the weakest of the year from both a volume and margin perspective for LPG exports. We had three lifting cancellations this year, one in June and two in July, and also worked with some our customers to defer scheduled lifting from third quarter to future quarters. We have not experienced further cancellations, and consistent with how he always operate our businesses, we continue to work to provide flexibility to our customers on a variety of fronts. We are currently seeing strength in LPG export demand, especially demand for butanes to stable markets in the Americas and other growing markets. We are able to simultaneously load propane and butane cargoes at our facility, either on the same vessel or on different vessels benefiting from the efficiencies of our facility infrastructure, which our customers seem to appreciate. Currently, we are seeing relatively strong demand for single year term deals, and we continue to experience success in extending long-standing annual contracts, while also addressing interest for multi-year contracts. Vessels leaving our facility continue to move to destinations consistent with previous quarters, with approximately 77% going to the Americas and 23% to areas such as Europe, Africa, and Asia in the third quarter of 2016. Looking forward, we believe the Americas will continue to show strong demand, and we are optimistic about increased demand from global petrochemical plants in Asia, and also from emerging markets like Africa, Indonesia, and India, all of which are demonstrating increased demand in the fourth quarter to date. Waterborne LPG transportation cost continue to reflect the growing global VLGC fleet, which is undergoing the largest single year increase in its history with 47 new builds expected to come online in 2016. The majority of these new ships were delivered in the first half of this year, which dramatically pushed shipping rates lower. Over the third quarter, we continue to see lower shipping rates. Using the Baltic shipping rate as an indicator, we began the quarter at just under $26 per metric ton. The rates continue to trend downward and hit a low around $18.50 in early September. Since then rates have increased slowly and steadily to around $29 per metric ton as of late October. During the latter half of the third quarter, we also saw vessels which were being used as floating storage inventory began moving to consuming markets. These were all positive indications that demand was beginning to creep back up. On the fractionation side of our business, we are benefiting from increased G&P filled activity, and looking year-over-year higher Targa equity volumes running through our fractionators, and we expect this trend to continue over the medium term; maybe not each quarter-to-quarter because of other factors, but on a yearly or LTM basis. As we look forward, the impact of more ethane being extracted domestically from upstream operations will be significant, driven by demand from ethane exports, and new large scale petrochemical crackers coming online in 2017 and beyond. Targa has available fractionation capacity and is positioned in the near and longer term to benefit. As many of you know, we brought Train 5 online during the second quarter, and also now have all the permits needed to proceed with 100,000 barrel per day Train 6 when needed, with a view that it is a matter of when and not if we will need to expand Mont Belvieu fractionation. On our second quarter call, we described that as a result of Train 5 coming online, we were no longer sending NGL volumes to Lake Charles to be fractionated. We also mentioned that we were considering other promising commercial uses for the Lake Charles fractionation facility, and now have finalized the terms for a new commercial deal during the third quarter. While it is an exciting project to us and demonstrates ingenuity on behalf of our employees, it is a relatively small project. We are utilizing an existing facility to generate additional margin without sacrificing our ability to use the operation in the future to fractionate overflow volumes from Mont Belvieu. Very simply described, we are spending a nominal amount of CapEx at attractive returns to fractionate ethane-propane mix at the facility to provide a nearby customer with purity ethane and propane. Shifting attention to our Petroleum Logistics business, all required permits have been received for our 35,000 barrel per day crude and condensates splitter at Channelview terminal and construction is well underway. We continue to expect the asset to be operational in the first quarter of 2018, and as previously discussed, we are already receiving an annual fee for it. At this point we are not announcing any other major downstream products; however, we are working on a number of attractive opportunities. So hopefully, that provides you with a little more color on what we are seeing downstream. And I will now pass the call over to Pat McDonie to discuss some of the trends that he is seeing in the Southern G&P side of our business.
Pat McDonie: Thanks Scott and good morning. Over the last six months or so we have seen a number of different things dominate our southern field G&P landscape. First, excitement over Permian producer results that just keep getting better, shorter drilling times, coupled with success from longer laterals, driving higher IPs, greater EURs, and lower breakeven costs. As rigs have been added in the Permian over the past few months, Targa has benefited particularly on the WestTX system. Second, Permian results and producer desire for additional acreage across the basin have driven a number of large and significant upstream M&A transactions. Targa has and will further benefit from some of these transactions, as some important customers are putting together large contiguous dedicated blocks of acreage around our existing systems. And third, increasing delineation of the STACK and SCOOP plays with the producers successfully improving EURs spacing, identification and completion efficiencies. For Targa, our areas of commercial focus in southern field G&P have been to continue to identify attractive opportunities to add acreage dedications and to grow volumes in margins across the Midland Basin, the Delaware Basin, the STACK, SCOOP and Eagle Ford. We believe that we have some inherited advantages given the position of many of our existing pipes and plans, and are focused on leveraging those advantages to grow our footprints across each of those areas. The 200 million cubic feet per day Buffalo Plant in WestTX came online in the second quarter and is rapidly filling, accelerating our need for additional infrastructure, and as discussed projects adding processing capacity in WestTX are now underway. The additional capacity needs being driven by increasing producer activity and results. If you had a chance to see Pioneer's earnings release of yesterday, their Q3 earnings release of yesterday. Pioneer being our partner and largest producer on the system, they stated that they will be increasing the company's horizontal rig count from 12 rigs to 17 rigs in the Northern Spraberry/Wolfcamp during the second half of 2016. Three rigs were added during September and October as planned, with two additional rigs expected in November. Their comments are consistent with those of the remaining large portfolio of customers that are dedicated to our system. Our new 200 million cubic feet per day Raptor Plant in SouthTX will be online in Q1, 2017, and will provide us with an Eagle Ford footprint that we think is very well positioned. In the third quarter, we gathered and processed lower volumes versus the second quarter, as producers are able to more readily move short term, low margin volumes at central delivery points. We believe that there will be continued asset rationalization in the Eagle Ford, and that our multi-plant, multi-location footprint will benefit Targa as we have flexibility related to outlets, delivery points, and reliability that are attractive to the producers. For Targa, we guided to higher average 2016 field G&P volumes versus average 2015, driven by higher Permian and SouthTX volumes, offset by lower NorthTX, WestOK and SouthOK volumes. We have 10 months [RD] under our belt and my expectations are unchanged. One month into the fourth quarter, we have seen continued volume growth in the Permian Basin, and continued activity around our WestOK and SouthOK systems. Overall, as we look into 2017 and beyond, we feel very good about the strength and position of our gathering and processing systems. Permian volumes will continue to grow, driven by our WestTX and SAOU systems. Our ability to continue to be successful in penetrating the STACK and SCOOP and the producers activity in our areas will determine the trajectory of volumes in areas like WestOK, SouthOK, and even North Texas. We have an Eagle Ford position that we really like and believe that the Sanchez advantaged Raptor plant coming online in early 2017 will provide us with additional advantages. I will turn it over to Danny now who will discuss some of the trends that he is seeing up in the Bakken.
Danny Middlebrooks: Thank you, Pat and good morning. For our Badlands Systems (inaudible) gather both crude oil and natural gas, year-to-date 2016 has been highlighted by our mutually supported relationship with the MHA Nation or the three affiliated tribes, which has resulted in significant right away progress this year in building out our infrastructure, spending growth CapEx dollars to lay pipe to wells that in some cases have already been drilled in areas where we are experiencing additional drilling activity. On our second quarter earnings call, we mentioned a 13,000 barrel per day pipeline project to (inaudible) that is currently being trucked plus crude from new completions that are happening now. As of Tuesday, November 1, we are mechanically completing on 50% of the 30 miles of pipeline we are laying for this project, and as of today, we have initial production flowing of up to 2,500 barrels per day. We continue to expect this project to be fully completed during the fourth quarter of 2016, and for the full 13,000 barrels per day to be flowing by year-end. Our guidance for 2016 was that we expected average 2016 natural gas volumes to be higher than average 2015 volumes, and that we expected crude oil volumes to be approximately flat, and we’re on track to deliver on that guidance. We expect that we will not need to spend as much capital to collect future volumes on our dedicated acreage as we needed previously. Given that our infrastructure is largely built out and future volumes from new drilling activity and /or from the completions of [ducts], wells that been drilled but not yet completed will be located in closer proximity to what has been built out, as we enter into new contracts for new (inaudible) dedications and/or additional plain infrastructure that will obviously increase our capital spending trajectory. Feedback we are hearing from our producers is that at prices similar to the strip today, we're likely to see meaningful additional drilling in our area of the Bakken over the next several years. Given Targa's attractive per unit margins for both gas and crude oil in the Bakken and the available capacity of lower Missouri plants, we are poised to benefit with any (inaudible) in drilling activity. Joe Bob, I think that covers it for me. Thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Dan. Thanks everybody. We’ve covered a lot of ground today, with one of our longest scripted comments and certainly with the highest number of scripted speakers. Given the environment, we thought that it might be helpful to spend more time talking about our assets and positioning, and to let you hear about it from the folks that are leading those efforts every day. If not helpful, I'm sure you will give Jen or me feedback. We at Targa are focused and enthusiastic about the opportunities in front of us, and we are cautiously optimistic about the trends we are seeing. This has been a tough year, but I think we are starting to feel some tailwinds at our back. I believe that our execution over the last couple of years with some significant headwinds should provide even more comfort to investors about the quality of Targa assets and the capabilities of Targa people. I'm very proud of both. When I think of all of the steps that we have taken, significantly reducing costs, attractive recontracting, commercial execution, balance sheet management and others, it makes me even more enthusiastic for the future. Even if we see a temporary head (inaudible) in commodity prices or do not see the current strip materialize in the near term, I know that we are all well-positioned. Where there is activity we benefit, and in some other areas where there is consolidation we will benefit. As we see it, our positioning will provide opportunities for continued attractive performance across almost any expected environment. I want to wrap up by highlighting a few key points that I think are important as we sit here on November 2 with one month of Q4 already under our belt. Q4, 2016 EBITDA is expected to be higher than Q1, higher than Q2, and higher than Q3. We forecast fourth quarter of 2016 dividend coverage approaching 1.2 times, and reiterate that average coverage for the year will be slightly over 1.0 times. Looking forward we believe that our investors are exposed to an asset platform that cannot be replicated, and where Targa will clearly be a beneficiary in a recovering commodity price environment, benefiting from both improving prices and activity levels. So with that operator, please open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Brandon Blossman from TPH. Your line is open.
Brandon Blossman: Let's see, let's start off with ‘17 CapEx. It sounds like around 500 million or maybe a little bit more for that, processing plant in there, anything else or any other color available as to what would fall into that line item?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yeah, we’re working through that now. There are a lot of projects we are seeing on the gathering and processing side. There’re a lot of ones that are unlikely to even breakout into details, some $10 million and $20 million CapEx. So we're aggregating those and looking through our areas. We are still really formulating that, but we are seeing significant amount of activity, especially on the gathering and processing side. So we think that is going to be similar CapEx or it really is likely to be higher, just depending on what major projects that we want to announce or put into that bucket.
Brandon Blossman: Okay, that's helpful. Just following on that gathering and processing, smaller CapEx, Joe Bob you mentioned the increased Versado flexibility with full ownership and maybe not mentioned, but are there some possibilities of that showing up in the CapEx line item? If so I assume those are high over term projects. Any color you can add to that and then maybe something similar in the Mid-Continent?
Joe Bob Perkins: Sure, first if it wasn't clear, the capital expenditure associated with the acquisition of the Chevron interest is in the 2016 $525 million estimate. I know that number sounds familiar. You always have things move on the margin, but it includes the Chevron acquisition as well as the projects that we see between now and the end of year. Secondly, that additional flexibility, we’ve been spending money to support our horizontal San Andres play and to move into the Delaware primarily for Versado. That wasn’t where Chevron's EMP interests were at that time, and that provided the opportunity for us to acquire their interests. That continued effort at the scale of building existing capacity is in Matt's description of 2017 being at or more likely higher than 2016 levels. They are very attractive return opportunities. If we were to announce an even bigger project in that area, that would drive that 2017 directional sense even higher, and we do see opportunities around the system. And I like the fact that we're not constrained by Chevron worrying about whether they going to go consent or non-consent. It was a very amicable agreement, and I think that both parties are happy with it. I know that if you talk to Chevron, they would say we've always been a good partner. You said Mid-Continent, similarly, Pat; you want to address the Mid-Continent?
Pat McDonie: I think Matt touched on a lot of smaller projects that add up to a significant number on G&P spend, and I think it's just a result of some of the stuff that we have been talking to you in the past. It's getting acreage dedication that allows us to bolt onto our existing asset footprints and build out into new areas that have become active. And we’re going to see a lot of that. We're going to see volume adds as a result of that, and I think that's what we'll see in the Mid-Continent 2017.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is open.
Shneur Gershuni: A couple of questions here, I was wondering you definitely gave a ton of detail and that’s appreciated. But I was wondering if you can sort of expand on your exposure to the Delaware. I believe you have talked about it in the past about connecting the two systems together there. Are there opportunities to build processing plants? When you look at a map, it looks like you have an opportunity there, but you are kind of on the sides. I was wondering if you could sort of expand on that a little bit for everyone.
Joe Bob Perkins: I think you’re certainly looking at the right map, and that’s a very attractive area. We’ve been pushing to the South, Southwest of Versado, and have opportunities on broadly the western side of our Sandhills facility. We've looked at; it wasn't that long ago we announced without precision a plant in between those, we look forward to the opportunities, are working on those kinds of opportunities, but don't have any additional details to provide you right now, Shneur, other than that color and a hope the color was helpful.
Shneur Gershuni: And just a couple of quick follow-ups, in your prepared remarks you talked about extending LPG contracts. Can you talk about; are contracted levels for 2018-2019 going to look similar to where we are today? And then secondly, with respect to the Mid-Continent or specifically the SCOOP STACK have you secured any acreage dedications at all so that you could be able to move volumes to your (inaudible) plants?
Scott Pryor: Shneur this is Scott, I’ll try to take the first part of your question, and then I will take it over probably to Pat to address the second half. As far as LPG contracts and interest in extending contracts going forward, and what ‘17, ‘18 and forward look like. We're not prepared to give you any indication at this point, but what I would tell you is that the discussions are very robust with our existing and new potential customers on looking at long-term contracts going forward. We described in our prepared remarks that we are extending typical contracts that are negotiated on an annualized basis, and we're having success doing that, and we would like to get full understanding of what that looks like going forward as we mature throughout the balance of this year. But what I would tell you is that our belief is we’ll have success, we’ll be in the midst of all of the conversations, both in the Americas, as well as other parts of the world, that are continuing to develop. And with demand continuing to grow, we will have opportunities and I like our chances very, very well.
Shneur Gershuni: Okay and acreage dedication?
Scott Pryor: I don't speak to specific acreage dedications, but kind of consistent with the answer to the last question, we do have acreage dedications. We are building infrastructure. There is activity on that acreage, and we see a lot of additional activity through 2017. We continue to try to add acreage, and if you look at our Western Oklahoma system that you referred to the misaligned plans, we’re on the South, and the Southwest side of those facilities is where our incremental growth is occurring, and we expect it to continue.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Danilo Juvane from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Danilo Juvane: I wanted to circle back to the LPG [explore] question, and perhaps I’m looking at it with a more near-term lens. So the 6 million barrels per month average for the fourth quarter, is that something that you had visibility to prior to getting to 4Q or were you able to get incremental contracts?
Joe Bob Perkins: What I would tell you is that we had fairly good visibility, while we were in the third quarter, but a lot of it is shored up and we have got a lot more clarity as we move into the fourth quarter recognizing that we would always want to be cautious relative to providing levels of detail in the third quarter, relative to fourth quarter, given the fact that there was at that time the potential for cancellations with the shape of the market. We experienced cancellations in the third quarter. We referenced that in our script, we referenced that on our third earnings call, but we felt good about the fourth quarter. But certainly now that we are in November and we’ve already had one month that has past and obviously we know what those volumes look like, we feel very good about providing you all in this context where we are going to be for the fourth quarter.
Danilo Juvane: And presumably to the extent that you got those incremental contracts, you also got contracted revenue spot rates on those volumes. Is that fair?
Joe Bob Perkins: I would say that we have a mixture of contracts that shape up, that contribute to our fourth quarter volumes, both in a variety of contract structure, whether they’d be short or long term.
Danilo Juvane: Moving on to G&P, what was the cost of the processing plants that you guys are sanctioning here? I may have missed that earlier in your comments.
Matt Meloy: We have not provided a breakout for the plant cost related infrastructure by line item. We're still working through our plan on that. So we will provide some more color about how much we think it is going to be in the Permian related to that plan. That’s one of the items we're still working through is what we think the cost is going to be for that. So we're still working on those pieces.
Pat McDonie: And what we publicly disclose on those pieces. I think it’d be fair to say that the costs of plants are lower today than they have been in the past.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Your line is open.
Faisel Khan: Just a couple of questions, can you just discuss a little bit on what’s going on with the trend in GPM in your West Texas system. It looks like those numbers are moving higher. Can you talk about, how much higher they can move and what’s going on in the system?
Matt Meloy: What you’re seeing out to there and you actually see a lot of that in SouthOK is a mix of the amount of ethane that we’re recovering. There are different contract structures at each plant, different transportation and other mechanisms that go into our decision of whether we recover or reject ethane. So typically when you see things moving around, I don't think we've seen a huge shift in the gas moving higher or lower GPM quality. It really has to do with more or less ethane being recovered.
Faisel Khan: Okay, so that's the big (inaudible) we're seeing. I think in one of your systems it looked like you went from 4/1 to 5/1. It was a pretty big move. So that’s just ethane coming out of the --
Matt Meloy: And the biggest move when you go through, it was on the SouthOK system, which is where you go in and out of recovery and rejection more than the others, but we do make those market decisions at those other plants as well.
Faisel Khan: Okay, got you. Going back to the uptick in the LPG volumes or export volumes in the fourth quarter, that's also more of a seasonal pattern that we are seeing globally, and generally speaking. Is this 4Q just a higher demand quarter for LPG demand overseas in general? Isn't it natural that 4Q would be higher than 3Q?
Scott Pryor: Faisel, to a certain degree that is correct? You are going to see some seasonality in certain market areas, for instance, in Europe and obviously due to the weather trends and things of that nature. Obviously South America would shift to a different direction as a result of that. But overall, it would say that you could have some seasonality affecting what fourth quarter looks like. But also at the same time, I recognize the fact that during the third quarter and as we alluded to in our comments today, there was a lot of shifts that were brought on the market during the first half of this year, and given expansions on the export side of the business, there was a lot of vessels that were loaded, and as a result of that - there was a lot of inventory that was sitting in areas like Singapore and others, that was waiting for a market uptick. Weather has something to do with that, global demand has a lot to do with that, petrochemical usage. So yes, weather contributes to it, but there are other factors that you have to consider on both demands as well as from an inventory perspective, as it impacted the third quarter of this year.
Matt Meloy: Speaking for Targa in particular, I think it would be better analysis to presume that the third quarter was driven down by the factors that Scott described, than the fourth quarter being driven up by strong seasonality.
Faisel Khan: Okay, got you. And then, one last question, in the Logistics and Marketing segment, it looks like OpEx picked up, looks about $5 million sequentially quarter-to-quarter. Can you just talk about what’s going on over there? Is that something related to either new capacity or new personnel coming online or what was driving that sort of higher number?
Matt Meloy: Primarily it was Train 5 being operational for the full quarter, and there’s also some fuel and power and other things which ticked up a little bit in Q3 relative to Q2.
Joe Bob Perkins: When we look at non-fuel O&M, we are very pleased the cost reduction across the company holding onto that cost reduction across the company and continuing to improve it on the margin. We, in fact have brought up facilities on the gathering and processing side and the downstream side, covering a lot of those costs by cost reduction. That’s something we are proud of.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of John Edwards from Credit Suisse.
John Edwards: I just have a couple of quick ones, on the South Texas G&P volumes it looked like they were down a bit sequentially, same with the frac volumes declined sequentially, and you acknowledging you got great process going forward. Just if you could fill us in on what drove those numbers?
Joe Bob Perkins: I think as we said in our prepared remarks is that the producers in South Texas area have the ability to move volumes around on an interruptible basis, and generally those are low margin volumes, and some of the levels at which people are willing to do that in the quarter were levels that we didn't want to approach. So our volumes were down on an interruptible basis, but our underpinned higher level margin volumes remained in place. Honestly, we do expect when we bring the Raptor plant on for us to be able to do a number of different things because of our asset position and the flexibility it provides from east to west, and we think our opportunities forward are significant.
Matt Meloy: And John on the frac side, as we mentioned and we've mentioned it in previous quarters as well, we had some low margin contracts that rolled off from 2015 to 2016, added with that extraction economics for ethane, obviously have suffered some. But the positive side is we've seen some of that with the improvement of equity volumes from increased G&P production from our own plants has offset some of those types of negatives.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.
Craig Shere: First question on the Sanchez JV; right now you are processing 100% of those volumes, right, but then when they transfer over to Raptor you'll only get credited 50%? So how does that work on an economic basis without becoming lumpy quarter-to-quarter?
Matt Meloy: You’re exactly right. We are processing those at our Silver Oak facilities where we own 100% of Silver Oak I and 90% of Silver Oak II. When the Raptor comes on, it will go into the 50/50 JV. So you are exactly right.
Craig Shere: Okay, so just from an economic standpoint there’s a short term blip.
Matt Meloy: Yeah. It will be reduced all in net economics to us when we move those through the Raptor plant, all things equal.
Craig Shere: Okay, fair enough. And Matt, when we think about, I don't know maybe 550 million to 600 million of 2017 spend and the disproportionate equity financing versus a normal 50/50 split, can you A, characterize anymore the disproportionality of equity, and B, give some longer term kind of signposts you’d be looking for, for when we might ease up on that equity pedal back to that 50/50 split?
Matt Meloy: Sure. A lot of it is really going to depend on the timing of the cash flows for when the projects come on, the amount of spend. We’ve lived in the three to four times debt-to-EBITDA target at the partnership level really since we've been public. Right now we're at 3.8 times. So it’s towards the higher end, but we are still within the range. So we’re going to keep a close eye on that as we move through 2017. So it's going to depend on the environment where the ultimate CapEx shakes out. What our ultimate EBITDA is, commodity price levels are, and we’ll just have to take a view as we go through into 2017. What we wanted to highlight is don't be surprised, depending on the environment, if we were to do more than 50% equity for that growth CapEx in 2017. But again that’s really dependent on the environment, what the all-in budget is and what the outlook is.
Joe Bob Perkins: What we're doing in that 525 plus capital direction that we just described for 2017 are attractive return projects regardless of the mix of equity and debt.
Craig Shere: Fair enough. So this is more kind of (inaudible) opportunistic, it’s not going to be mechanical where 75% is going to be kind of hit every quarter. It is more kind of nimble.
Joe Bob Perkins: We take a longer term view of our all-in capital structure. So it’s certainly not quarter-to-quarter or even year-to-year. I think our long term target is with that 50% debt, 50% equity has worked for us over time. But in any given year or quarter it could be more heavily weighted towards debt or equity. So no, it’s not that we spend this much in Q1, so we are going to do that much equity. We're going to look at the balance of the year, look at the forecast, and then make the best decision from there.
Craig Shere: Fair enough. And last one for me, any updates aground prospects for ethylene export opportunities?
Scott Pryor: Craig, this is Scott. We continue to be in that conversation. As you guys will recall, currently today we have the only facility in North America that exports ethylene on behalf of a very strategic customer that we have both in Belvieu as well as Galena Park. With that said, obviously the entire market as it relates to petrochemical expansion in ‘17 and ‘18 is trying to understand what the balance is going to look like for ethylene production, what the global demand is going to look like as it relates to that. Is it going to move out as ethylene or is it going to move out as derivatives. I think it’s likely going to be a mixture of both and we are involved in a variety of conversations that would be supportive of us looking just strategically at what it would take for us to enhance our abilities to load out ethylene. Given the fact that we’ve already got a facility that does it today, we’ve got infrastructure outside of the stated direct boundary lines of the asset at Galena Park, then obviously I think it makes strategic sense, economic sense and logistical sense for us to be involved in that conversation.
Craig Shere: Would you say the conversations have the potential in the next year to manifest in anything that can be meaningful in terms of the overall economics of the facilities?
Scott Pryor: I would say we are not prepared to give any sort of lead into that sort of questioning. But there’s always that potential. But we would like to bake things a little bit more before we give any sort of indication.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Chris Sighinolfi: Matt, I just wanted to clarify something. I think you had mentioned third quarter coverage being roughly 0.9 times. Just to clarify that's DCF over the TRGP common and the TRC preferred. Is that right?
Matt Meloy: Yes. It is over all outstanding, common and preferred dividend payment to TRC. That is right.
Chris Sighinolfi: And that’s consistent with how we should interpret the fourth quarter guidance around the 1.2 level?
Matt Meloy: Correct, and if we start defining it differently, we’ll scream loud about a change in definition.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. I just wanted to be clear. And then Joe Bob, can you remind me the Noble contract. I obviously remember when it happened. But with regard to the $40 million payment, can you remind me the tenants of that and for how long we should expect it, and then, are you guys planning when you talk about 4Q to include that in both the EBITDA and DCF numbers, or is that just a DCF number and exclusion from EBITDA?
Joe Bob Perkins: It is a DCF number and it may very well be included in adjusted EBITDA. Going back from memory is probably more than you want to hear. The deal was originally done towards the end of 2014. Someone needs to step up.
Jennifer Kneale: March 2014.
Joe Bob Perkins: March 2014. The recut of the deal was done midnight, December 31, 2014. That recut basically provided alternatives for our good customer Noble, as they looked at market opportunities and potential additional facilities to be combined with or without a condensate splitter. We said at the time, shortly after getting it done New Year's Eve, that that would not impact our forward economics of a project as if we had done it as originally negotiated, but instead, provided frankly an option payment for us. Over the next year, we did a lot of engineering work, worked with our customer to consider additional alternatives and then came back to essentially [doing] more flexible crude and condensates splitter project at the Channelview facility. We had not quantified the annual payment until this call, as I recall. On this call we described it as something over $40 million, payable in October and that will continue. We called it multi-year and we didn't say how long term of the contract was, but I think I would describe it as outside our forecast horizon. And that’s all good news. I think I started rambling with the history and may have forgotten the last points on your question.
Chris Sighinolfi: No, that is effectively what I was looking for, Joe Bob. So it’s kind of a lumpy receipt in terms of when in the year it falls, but per your guidance it’s happening on a repeated basis.
Joe Bob Perkins: It’s not lumpy on when it falls [larger receipt], we will have to then account for it properly for our DCF calculations in the future. By the way, we’ll have to account for it a little bit different when the plant starts because there will be some operating cost assisted with running the plant.
Matt Meloy: I just want to make sure we are clear on one thing. It will be lumpy in the sense that we'll receive that payment in October. So the cash payments received with the -- so that will go from October every year, sorry. And I was thinking of that as predictable or not. But it is lumpy.
Chris Sighinolfi: Right.
Joe Bob Perkins: Lumpy and predictable. I’m sorry, clear as mud. Thanks for cleaning that up, Matt. I’m sorry I miss-answered the lumpy question.
Chris Sighinolfi: I guess what I'm trying to get after is, is this for current purposes when there is not a plant running, this is the fourth quarter impact physically and in the reported, but it will be obviously affected by the operations when the plant’s up and running in more of a smooth (inaudible) impact, is that right, Matt?
Matt Meloy: Well, I think the best way to think about this is, we're going to be receiving that $40 million plus payment in October. So as you think about modeling and planning that out, just have that as in there. We’ll include that, it will be in DCF. As Joe Bob mentioned, we’re still determining whether we are going to include that in EBITDA, and then when the plant is up and running, we will have some deduct for OpEx when the plant’s up and running.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay, perfect. My final question, you guys have done a lot to sort of winterize or fortify the balance sheet with obviously the preferred equity and common equity and the debt-free financing. I’m just curious, with the TRP leverage now down to 3.75, 3.8 times, at what point, I don't want to be presumptuous, but like at what point is perhaps a credit rating upgrade in the cards at the TRP level, and have you had any discussions with the agency's post all of the activities you have done in the third quarter?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, we have continuous dialogue with the rating agencies. We have a good relationship with both that rate us. So we'll be meeting with them here on an annual basis relatively shortly, and we will lay out our forecast and ago over what our plans are. It’s tough to handicap when they would be comfortable in making a move on us. It’s pretty difficult to predict. I think where we are right now, don't really view it as impacting much our ability to access the markets as evidenced by our note offerings, the 5 5/8 and 5 3/8. So it would be nice to get an upgrade. I think if you look at our credit metrics, we grade out to a higher credit rating than where we are? But I don't know that if it’s really needed to get attractive terms for financing
Chris Sighinolfi: And then a related question and a final one from me, do you have a long term target. I know we used to talk about at the TRP level, but in terms of the consolidated entity I know you mentioned we are sitting still around 4.5. Do you have a long term view of where you would like that to be? Obviously, respective to the opportunity set and the commodity price environment, but is there something that we should be thinking about longer term?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes. I think the three to four times at TRP, longer term I think we’d like to get TRC consolidated there. It would be nice to get our debt-to-EBITDA there at TRC by growing our EBITDA, would be to most economic way to get there. So as long as TRPs, we are in that three to four times and managing leverage there, we have time to manage the consolidated leverage to the long term profile that we’d like.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jerry Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Charlie for Jeremy. Just curious on how much third party volumes are running through the frac now. So looking at that at 313 figure, are you still in control of those barrels, and is that very competitive. And additionally real quick, is there any risk in customers electing to send those bonds elsewhere since Targa does not have complete control of the takeaway?
Joe Bob Perkins: So first question, we don't give a break out of what our Targa equity volumes or controlled volumes through our fractionation relative to third parties. I’d say that we have a mix of both. I think what I would say is that you’ve seen in our numbers; we’ve had some third party contracts go to other fractionation facilities. So that’s impacted our numbers on a year-over-year basis. Those were relatively low margin business that moved elsewhere. But, yes there is some risk of that. On prior calls, we don't have in this script, but the amount of third party contracts coming up over the next several years is relatively low. I actually do not have that at my fingertips. It was in last quarter's script, if you want to go look at it. So it’s relatively small the amount of contracts that would be really available to move over the near term.
Matt Meloy: And without saying what percentage was third party control. You did hear us say and explicitly so, that we are increasing our equity volumes. We are always seeking to have control of the volumes that are going through our fractionator, and I would say that we’ve done a better job of that over the last couple of years than we did in the first couple of years of our history.
Operator: At this time I’m showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Joe Bob Perkins for closing remarks.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you, operator, and thank you everyone on the call for your patience. We hope that the additional color and the additional speakers work for you. Please feel free to contact Jen, Matt, or any of us with your questions. Thanks again.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Targa Resources' Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is maybe recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Jennifer Kneale, Vice President, Finance. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Jennifer Kneale: Thank you, Kristie. I'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2016 investor call for Targa Resources Corp. Before we get started, I'd like to mention that Targa Resources Corp., Targa, TRC, or the company, has published its earnings release, which is available on our website at www.targaresources.com. An updated investor presentation will also be posted to our website later today.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Bob Perkins.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Jen. Good morning, and thanks to everyone for joining. For this morning's call, I am going to focus on two key areas; first, at the beginning of the call, describing highlights from our second quarter results and operational performance and expectations for the balance of 2016, given the current environment, and then at the end of the call, clarifying our current thoughts about leverage and coverage going forward. In between those areas, Matt will cover our second quarter results. As we begin, I want to start with the headlines of business performance that are reflective of our strong positioning for the current environment and for future environments. At the G&P segment level, Targa's peak Gathering and Processing natural gas inlet volumes were about 3.5 billion cubic feet per day in the second quarter of 2015. From the third quarter of 2015 through the first quarter of 2016, those volumes declined each quarter, as a result of commodity prices and associated activity levels. But in the second quarter of 2016, daily inlet volumes increased back to about 3.5 billion cubic feet per day. These high-level results demonstrate the resiliency of our Gathering and Processing footprint, as a result of Targa having assets well positioned to serve some of the best producers. Producers that are active in the most economic oil and liquids-rich areas. Our Gathering and Processing operating margin was only 4% lower in Q2 2016 versus Q2 2015. Remember, with the backdrop of prices that were down significantly more than that, natural gas prices down 31%, condensate prices down 22%, and NGL prices down 5%. In that pricing environment, we were able to substantially offset the significant reduction in commodity prices by increasing the overall profitability of our Gathering and Processing contracts to improve contracting with added fees. If we look at our results sequentially, Field G&P, natural gas inlet volumes were up 3%. Field NGL production is up 17% and fractionation volumes are up 12%. Demonstrating that as prices recover domestically, Targa's footprint will be an early beneficiary, as improved commodity prices drive increased activity levels and volumes. Compared to second quarter 2015, we reported higher volumes for South Texas, the Badlands, the Permian and Coastal, offset by declines in North Texas and Oklahoma. This is encouraging. We placed our 200 million cubic feet per day Buffalo plant in service in West Texas in April, providing timely relief to a system that was operating overcapacity and where volumes are still growing in this area where we have Gathering and Processing joint venture with Pioneer. In South Texas, our joint venture with Sanchez is going well and our volume growth this quarter in South Texas is primarily from Sanchez volumes associated with new activity and production and also from processing additional volumes as Sanchez's contracts with other mid-stream providers roll off. Volumetrically, with half of the year under our belt, we continue to expect the average 2016 natural gas inlet volumes in South Texas, the Permian and the Badlands to be higher than average 2015 volumes, offset by declines in other Central region systems. We continue to expect Badlands crude gathered volumes to be approximately flat, average 2016 versus average 2015. And in the Bakken we're seeing activity around our system and recently started construction on 26 miles of crude oil pipeline that will gather an existing 13,000 barrels per day of crude oil with more wells planned to connect to that pipe for the rest of 2016 and beyond. In the Downstream segment, for the second quarter in a row, we exported approximately 5.5 million barrels per month of LPGs, an increase of 10% versus the second quarter of 2015. I know there've been recent new stories related to concerns around global LPG demand, in particular, Chinese counterpart risk. I'd like to share Targa's perspective. We have a very diverse portfolio of counterparties who lift export cargoes from our Galena Park facility. And similar to past quarters, we provide a snapshot today showing approximately 75% of cargoes leaving our dock over the last 12 months have been to destinations in Latin America, the Caribbean, and South America - the Americas, that is up slightly from the LTM percentages last quarter, showing a slight increase to those markets. I talk often about the flexibility of our facilities. Flexibility to serve large, medium and small vessels, combined with our ability to provide mixed cargoes of propane and butane, and of course, the U.S. Gulf Coast location advantage. These are very good fits for the customers in those Americas markets. These factors support the sustained level of LPG export activity that you're seeing from Targa's facilities, and are of course less impacted by the recent dynamics of Asian markets that are being discussed publicly. If 75% of cargoes are traveling to Latin America, South America and the Caribbean, then of course, approximately 25% of our cargoes travel beyond the Americas. As we do across all our businesses, we structure our LPG export contracts for potential increased counterparty risk. And for example, where appropriate, have common requirements such as prepayments and postings of letters of credit prior to vessel loading. The potential risk of non-performance of our customers is always a factor as we assess whether to add a customer to our diverse portfolio. How to contract with them and how we might forecast their performance. We do not, never have, discussed specific customer situations. But we can assure you that we continue to feel good about our longstanding guidance that we will export at least 5 million barrels per month of LPGs for 2016. And we can tell you that we are well positioned relative to Asian LPG demand fluctuations, as evidenced by our track record and the fact that three quarters of our business is focused on markets in the Western Hemisphere. Year-to-date, we have had three cancellations at our facility, one in June and two in July, and we were paid cancellation fees. We also sometimes work with our customers, when necessary and for additional fees, to mutually agree to defer cargoes to later delivery dates. As such customers defer, this provides opportunities to fill near-term available space at our facilities with incremental export volumes. Given these current market dynamics and allowing for potential cancellations and deferrals during the quarter, I believe that LPG volumes in the third quarter could likely be lower than in Q1 and Q2. However, to repeat myself, our volume guidance for 2016 is unchanged and we expect to export an average of at least 5 million barrels per month of LPGs for 2016. And, of course, not all months will be at the same level and not all quarters will be at the same level. Now, moving to other areas. Fractionation volumes were higher in the second quarter of 2016 versus the first quarter of 2016, partially as a result of more volumes coming to Mont Belvieu, from increased Field G&P volumes and partially due to greater ethane recovery. We completed and put in service our fifth fractionator at our Mont Belvieu Cedar Bayou facility in May. Given that it's our newest fractionator and built with the most flexible technology, we're already running significant volumes through Train 5 and benefiting from greater efficiencies. Also, as we've discussed, as a result of Train 5 coming online, we are no longer sending volumes to Lake Charles to be fractionated and are considering other commercial uses for the facility, which look very promising. To the extent that we continue to benefit from more ethane being extracted rather than rejected plus the potential of increased back half 2016 increases and producer activity levels and volumes, then even greater NGL volumes will flow to Mont Belvieu and Targa is poised to benefit from that. Of course, we would also benefit from increased ethane pricing that'd come with that in our POP contracts. So, given the environment, given that this was the second quarter of the year, a year with a very tough start, I feel good. Frankly, really good about inlet volume trends, contracting trends, NGL volume trends and continued cost reductions. And that's only the stuff we're reporting. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt, to discuss our second quarter results in more detail.
Matthew Meloy: Thanks, Joe Bob. I'd like to add my welcome and thank you for joining our call today. Targa's reported adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $257 million and distributable cash flow was $170 million. Overall reported operating margin for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately 8% lower compared to the second quarter last year and I will discuss in more detail in the segment results in a few moments. Reported net maintenance CapEx were $19 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $26 million in the second quarter of 2015. We previously guided to $110 million of net maintenance CapEx for 2016. Given we are now half way through the year and have spent approximately $33 million; we expect net maintenance CapEx to be closer to $90 million for 2016, or perhaps a bit lower. Now turning to the segment level, I'll summarize the second quarter's performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with the Downstream segment, second quarter reported operating margin decreased 13% compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by the payment of contract renegotiation fees in 2015 related to the noble crude and condensate splitter, lower LPG export margin, lower fractionation margin and lower terminaling and storage throughput. As Joe Bob mentioned, we loaded an average of 5.5 million barrels per month of LPG exports for the second quarter, which was flat to the first quarter of 2016 and an increase of 10% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Fractionation volumes decreased by 8% in the second quarter of 2016 versus the same period last year, primarily as a result of lower supply volumes at Mont Belvieu and some contract roll-offs at the end of 2015. Downstream segment reported operating expenses - reported operating expenses decreased by 4% in the second quarter of 2016 versus the same time period last year, as a result of both continued cost-saving efforts and lower fuel and power costs. Even with the additional OpEx associated with bringing CBF Train 5 online in May 2016. Turning to the Gathering and Processing segment, reported operating margin for the second quarter of 2016 decreased by 4% compared to last year, primarily due to lower commodity prices. Natural gas prices were 31% lower, condensate prices were 22% lower, and NGL prices were 5% lower compared to the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter reported 2016 natural gas inlet volumes for Field Gathering and Processing were a little over 2.6 billion cubic feet per day. For the quarter, there was a 10% increase in gross NGL production versus the same time period in 2015, driven primarily from increased volumes and WestTX and South Texas. In April, our Buffalo plant in WestTX came online and we immediately shipped volumes from some of our other plants that were running overcapacity. The addition of the Buffalo plant and continued activity by a number of strong producers in West Texas resulted in an increase in volumes of 14% in the second quarter versus the same time period last year. Crude oil gathered with 105,000 barrels per day in the second quarter, approximately flat versus the same time period last year and flat compared to the first quarter of this year. Related to operating expenses for the G&P segment, we continue to focus on cost reductions across all of our assets. Second quarter 2016 Gathering and Processing segment OpEx was 5% lower than second quarter of 2015, despite the addition of Buffalo plant and an outage for planned maintenance at Sand Hills. Let's now move to capital structure and liquidity. As of June 30, we have $55 million of borrowings under TRP's $1.6 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due October 2017. With outstanding letters of credit of $13 million, availability at quarter end was more than $1.5 billion. We are currently in the process of extending the maturity of our $1.6 billion revolver to August 2019. And Targa continues to benefit from strong support in the bank market. We are now oversubscribed for the full $1.6 billion and the amendment should be completed soon subject to finalizing the closing documents. At quarter end, we also had borrowings of $225 million under our accounts receivable securitization facility. This year, in addition to an intense operational and commercial focus, we also focused on continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. We are very well positioned with compliant debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 3.6 times at the Targa Resources Partners level. This ratio compares very well to our 5.5 times compliance covenant and that is the only meaningful financial covenant across the Targa family. Also, in the second quarter and through July, we have raised approximately $250 million in equity through our at-the-market program at TRGP with net proceeds used to reduce leverage and now available to fund future capital spending. Our ability to raise a substantial amount of public equity through the ATM program had a reasonable yield, while never representing a meaningful amount of TRGP daily equity trading volume, shows some of the benefits of being a C-Corp with significantly higher daily equity trading liquidity. At the TRC level, we had $270 million of borrowing outstanding under our $670 million senior secured credit facility that matures in February 2020 and the balance on TRC's term-loan facility that matures in February 2022 was $160 million. TRC availability at quarter end was $395 million. Including a $171 million in cash, total Targa liquidity at quarter end was approximately to $2.1 billion. Our fee-based operating margin for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately 78%. Given we're halfway through the year, it is reasonable to assume that our operating margin will be more than 75% fee-based during 2016, and then if it is lower, then we will have benefited from substantially-higher EBITDA. Turning to hedges, for non-fee-based operating margin, relative to the partnership's current estimate of equity volumes from our Field Gathering and Processing, we estimate that we have hedged approximately 70% of the remaining 2016 natural gas, 60% of remaining 2016 condensate and approximately 20% of remaining 2016 NGL volumes. For 2017, we estimate we've hedged approximately 45% of natural gas, 45% of condensate, and approximately 10% of NGL volumes. Moving on to capital spending, we estimate approximately $525 million for net growth capital expenditures in 2016 and as mentioned earlier, approximately $90 million for net maintenance capital expenditures. Except for CBF Train 5 in Buffalo, which are already completed in the Noble splitter, this CapEx is pointed to smaller, high-impact attractive return projects around some of our best assets. For example, in the Bakken, Permian, SCOOP. Furthermore, we are certainly working on project development for the future, potential new projects ranging from small to large that leverage our asset and expertise. Our distributable cash flow for the quarter was $170 million, resulting in dividend coverage of approximately one times based on our second quarter declared dividend of $0.91 per common share or $3.64 on an annualized basis. That's wraps up my comments, and I'll hand it back over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you, Matt. I like the results. As I mentioned at the outset of our call, I'd like to now provide some additional clarity to our current thinking about leveraging coverage, sharing the thinking behind our actions and behind how we are trying to steer the Targa ship. Through a couple of very important steps started last year and executed this year, the buy-in of TRP's common units, the preferred offering at TRC, TRC's ATM activity and other commercial and operational measures discussed today. We have continued to improve our balance sheet, ensuring that we are positioned with financial strength and flexibility looking forward for a range of potential industry environments. We currently have approximately $5 billion of total consolidated debt and our consolidated debt-to-EBITDA ratio is approximately 4.4 times. By managing our balance sheet and by focusing on bottom line cash flow performance, we've continued to provide our shareholders with attractive quarterly cash dividends of $0.91 per common share or $3.64 per common share annualized. This stable dividend, stable for the last four quarters also reflects our focus on balance sheet management and managing Targa's dividend payout prudently in this environment. At this point, I think we're comfortable sharing the following additional color related to Targa and how we think about it on a go-forward basis. Although we are comfortable in the near and middle term, with a mid-three times TRP compliance ratio and the room that gives us relative to the only impactful compliance test of 5.5 times at TRP, our long-term - longer term consolidated leverage desire for Targa is really unchanged versus how we operated a few years ago and how we talked about it when we had the public GP and a public MLP structure and targeted a leverage ratio of three to four times at the MLP when there really wasn't any debt outstanding at TRC. We do believe that over the longer term, three to four times consolidated leverage ratio target will provide us with an appropriate long-term balance sheet position to have access to the capital needed to grow the company and provide the company with the ability to pay attractive dividends to our shareholders, while protecting our shareholders from some of the volatility associated with commodity price cycles. Assuming balance sheet strength and a positive market-based outlook, we will be able to continue to provide our common shareholders with attractive cash flow in the form of dividends. We will continue to evaluate and evolve to what an appropriate long-term target range for dividend coverage or dividend payout is for Targa. And we have historically reviewed that with our board on at least a quarterly basis. We have previously run higher coverage when commodity prices and commodity price outlook have been strong and rising, which has provided additional stability and flexibility during the down cycles. Today as a standalone C-Corp, during future cycles of strong and rising commodity prices, we may run higher coverage than we did prior to the buy-in or than we did in the lower commodity price environments, which would provide us with benefits during future down cycles. Remembering our conservative view of coverage looking backwards, coupled with our focus on our balance sheet, leaves Targa well positioned today during more of a down cycle. And we expect full-year 2016 coverage at the current dividend rate to be at least one times. That's very good news. Just as we operate with lower coverage during down cycles and higher coverage during up cycles, similarly we may operate with higher leverage during down cycles and lower leverage during up cycles. That's simply how we think about it. Looking forward, in the context of that shared thinking, we believe that through an investment in Targa, investors will have ownership in a high-performing, well-positioned midstream C-Corp that has a premier Gathering and Processing business and a leading natural gas liquids business with some of the following characteristics. Diversified Gathering and Processing assets in some of the best crude and liquids-rich basins in the country, highlighted by strong positioning for continued development in the Permian Basin, with an outstanding Permian Gathering and Processing footprint stretching from the West to the East, with very well positioned exposure to activity in the Midland Basin, the Wolfcamp Spraberry of the Central Basin platform and the Delaware Basin. Three of our four Permian multi-plant systems are connected, providing us with operational flexibility and providing our customers with the reliability of these multi-plant systems and backup from the interconnected system. Our interconnected footprint makes us very competitive for both new and takeaway gas. And, depending on location, we currently have available capacity to benefit almost immediately from continued and increasing producer activity. Similarly, we're well positioned in the Bakken, Eagle Ford and SCOOP, where again, we have available capacity to benefit from continued and increasing producer activity. And Targa has other options to benefit from E&P activity or activity improvements. For example, leveraging our existing WestOk system to gather and process stacked volumes to the south. We have to spend a little money, we are working on the commercial contracts, but we're well positioned. As a result of our very well positioned Gathering and Processing assets, Targa investors will benefit from even slight tailwinds associated with an environment of improving commodity prices, especially crude and NGLs. We've worked hard and added fees over time to our POP contracts often improving the overall margin and providing more of a floor. We are certainly not fully hedged, especially on NGLs. And as a result to the extent that prices rise, Targa will benefit immediately from higher price realization from our POP contracts. Targa's investors also benefit from our Downstream footprint. In the NGL market hub at Mont Belvieu and that surrounding larger market hub, interconnected to NGL supply and customers and to our facilities on the Houston Ship Channel. And such an interconnected multi-component position would be extremely expensive to replicate today. Our well positioned Mont Belvieu fractionation and salt dome storage capabilities are connected to an extensive pipeline network connecting NGL supply and demand. We're the second largest fractionator of natural gas liquids and we'll benefit directly as the world-class ethane crackers being built by the petrochemical industry come online over the next couple of years. Ethane prices will probably have to be higher to incent more recovery. And Targa will benefit in our G&P business from an increase in ethane prices and will also benefit as more ethane volumes flow to Mont Belvieu to support petrochemical growth and exports of ethane from the U.S. Rising ethane prices will pull some of the other components of NGL barrel higher, and again we will recognize immediate benefits. Our fractionation business and associated infrastructure supports our LPG export facility. We have very flexible export services and continue to perform in moving propane and butanes across our dock into international markets. We have a demonstrated track record of capturing a significant portion of global demand for the Gulf Coast-based LPG exports. Targa has and over time will continue to improve our balance sheet with manageable leverage that can withstand industry downturns. That positions us to take advantage of attractive capital investment opportunities that accrue to a well-positioned strategic asset base, and potentially positions us for strategic opportunities in identifying very attractive M&A. Our balance sheet also allows for attractive annual dividends to investors. Our yield-based on yesterday's close was 9.7%. Our second quarter consolidated leverage ratio was approximately 4.4 times and we are one of the best positioned midstream companies, able to navigate the choppy seas of the current environment and poised to benefit as the industry gets some wind in its sails, and prices and activity levels improve, potentially one of the first to benefit. Over the next five or more years, Targa does not expect to pay cash taxes. And the only adjustment to our forecast that will change that expectation is significantly higher EBITDA. Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, an investment in Targa is supported by Targa's employees who I think are the best in the business. The last year and a half have proved that our employees can manage capital efficiency decisions, reduce costs, and identify growth opportunities all at the same time. And they just flat out execute in any environment. And I think we have a management team and a board that has demonstrated a track record of proactively enabling those employees and making decisions to best position the company for success across all industry environments, a company I'm externally proud to be a part of. I believe our results for the quarter speak to the investor themes I just talked about. Today's results, our prepared comments, the new investor presentation, all show positive trend and positioning for future upside. For example, along several dimensions that you're hearing from Matt and me today, volume growth certainly deserves a nod in the current environment. And we are positioned well, growing in the current environment and better positioned for a recovery environment, especially in the Permian, Bakken and SCOOP for example. Go to the presentation and look at the rig charts as of mid-July in those areas, a little bit surprising to the upside. Secondly, improvements in Gathering and Processing contracting; this is obvious from our overall results despite year-over-year reduction in commodity prices and bodes well for performance upside with some commodity price recovery. And thirdly, improvements in NGL volumes. They are demonstrated in the numbers and they are driven by increased volumes at inlet and gas plants, going all the way Downstream to our fractionation and demonstrated by additional ethane recovery, with more upside to come with improved pricing. And, of course, continued cost reduction progress is impressive and obvious from the numbers. So with that operator, please open up the line to questions and I thank you all for your patience in our prepared remarks.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni of UBS. Your line is open.
Shneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning, guys.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hey, good morning.
Shneur Gershuni: I figured I'd start off with LPG, let's just sort of knock this out. Lot of time, sort of, spent on LPG exports rather than a lot of the other opportunities that you have. I realize that for competitive reasons disclosing the MVCs and prices and so forth is difficult and so forth. I was wondering, if maybe we can approach it from a different angle. I was wondering if you can talk about your customers' intentions at this point right now. Do they have options on contracts that they're thinking about extending? I was just wondering if you can give us some color about contract extensions. Could we see something where you continue to have like a floor of, I guess, MVCs, let say, through 2020 or so forth? Any kind of color about those discussions, in terms of extending your relationships with them, I think would be helpful?
Joe Bob Perkins: This is Joe Bob. And I appreciate the high level nature of the question and I think we'll try to add some color to that. Talking about customers, plural, and not any specific customer.
Shneur Gershuni: Correct.
Joe Bob Perkins: You know we don't do. And what is the mood of market. I want to start by saying, throughout the short history of LPG exports, aided by terrific market dynamics and U.S. exports reaching markets where our supply needs to - is necessary to meet their demand, our pattern has been to repeat with our customer base, to extend with our customer base and to add business with our customer base. Sometimes those discussions are more intense than others, but they're pretty constant because we've done a good job for those customers and they continue to have opportunities. Scott, as you think about my super high level answer - Scott Pryor, our Executive Vice President of NGL, Logistics and Marketing, runs half our company, is with us here today. I saw you kind of nodding. What would you add to that?
Scott Pryor: Well, I think, some of the first things I would add is - I think it's important to note, especially with some of the things that you read in the marketplace today, we have first and foremost a number of customers that are performing on their contracts. We're in a variety of discussions with all of our contract portfolio to renegotiate extensions as well as new customers. It's a tough market out there in the environment we're in today, and we recognize that. You've heard from other earnings calls that there are challenges. But, today, it's our belief that the pricing environment today is not really reflective of what the true supply-demand is, especially when you look at production east of the Suez and what demand looks like both today and going forward in the Asian marketplace. So, what I would tell you is that a number of our liftings, as we've indicated in our reports today, in the Americas, most of our production, 75% or more is going to the Americas, and that demand is not wavering. And we believe that it is actually continuing to grow. So that will be a focal point. And that will be something that we will provide nearby - supply to those nearby locations and points of destinations.
Shneur Gershuni: That's really helpful color. I really appreciate that. As a follow up, Joe Bob, towards the end of your prepared remarks, you sort of talked about - take a look at the rig activity recently. As you talk with your E&P customers in the Permian, or I guess, partners, I guess, is the best way to put that, with the recent rig activity and their talk about completions and CapEx so forth, how much capacity do you have in place to handle the growth that Pioneer is talking about as well as others. Do you think at some point discussions start to turn towards building new facilities? I mean, do we ultimately end up having to add capacity at some point? Just wondering if you can sort of give us a little color about that as well, too?
Joe Bob Perkins: Happy to give you color. I'm not going to be the source of information that's not public from Pioneer but the public information for Pioneer is of course consistent with what they share with us. They are a very good partner. And I want to continue to have great relationship with them. When you look at the results of their longer laterals, higher IP's, higher EURs, this is presented publicly, consistent with what we've seen privately, that's really good news for Targa. And relative to Pioneer, I love their performance, but they're not the only ones doing that. There are some Pioneer look-alikes in the same basin doing the same thing. Higher IP's - longer laterals, higher IP's, higher EUR, and that works very, very well for us. We have interconnected systems there to provide some capacity backup. We have a small plant, as you know, that is sort of on standby, though we'd have to spend some money on it. And not very long in the distant future we would need to build another one. I'm not predicting when the time is. We put in a plant when we were overcapacity and just about to bust and we're just running hard to keep up on compression, to keep pressures down, so that we get maximum volume from Pioneer and other producers. It's a growing environment and I'm very happy about that. Yes, there will be a new plant at some point required. And we've got backup plant interconnects and one spare, small mothballed plant that might happen before that. Planning that out carefully with our partner and working hard to meet the needs of multiple producers in the area.
Shneur Gershuni: Great. Thank you very much, really appreciate the color.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Faisel Khan of Citigroup. Your line is open.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning, Faisel.
Faisel Khan: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks. Joe Bob, I'm glad you feel good about the current environment this late, may have added a few percentage points...
Joe Bob Perkins: Wait a second. I feel good about our performance in the current environment.
Faisel Khan: Sounds good. Just your comments about the Lake Charles facility. You mentioned there are other uses for that facility. Can you elaborate a little bit more on sort of what you're thinking the future opportunities could be over there?
Joe Bob Perkins: No. And I don't mean to be rude about it. I had to work hard just to say that much. And Scott Pryor is giving me the devilish grin right now. It's a nice deal. We'll talk about it the next earnings call when it's completely signed up. But, for competitive reasons, customer relationship, respect reasons, that's all I'm going to say right now.
Faisel Khan: Okay, fair enough.
Joe Bob Perkins: Go ahead, Scott. Just a second.
Scott Pryor: I'd like to add something to that, though, if I could. As you guys know in the past, when we have had oversupply for Y-grade in Belvieu prior to our Train 5 coming online, we have used Lake Charles as an overflow point to fractionate those excess volumes. Obviously, we're not in that environment today. So the opportunities around looking for, if you will, enhanced EBITDA around some things that we can do at Lake Charles does not take away from our ability to continue to flow barrels over to Lake Charles when we do get back to an excess point here in Belvieu and we believe that, at some point, that will come again.
Faisel Khan: Okay. I understand.
Joe Bob Perkins: That makes it a really good deal.
Faisel Khan: Sounds good. We will look forward to that announcement. Just on the ATM program and the balance sheet. So I mean, you've got the total coverage ratio down to 4.4 and you are still sort of - it looks you're still in the market on the ATM, when - what should we expect out of that program for the rest of the year? And what is the target, sort of, ratio that you want to get to? Are you happy with your credit rating, are you aiming for to get back to investment grade or - sorry, get to investment grade for that matter?
Matthew Meloy: Yeah. I think where we find ourselves, we're kind of mid-3s at the TRP level and 4.4 on a consolidated level, raising the preferred equity we did earlier in the year. We find ourselves really not in an environment where we need to raise additional equity capital. So we like to be in that environment. So then we can just be opportunistic and if we think it makes sense to raise some more to keep the balance sheet on the strong side that'll be a subsequent decision. So, I think that's why you've seen us be proactive, whether it's doing the preferred offering in the first part of the year and continuing with the ATM and so that we're operating, so we can continue to fund the growth CapEx, the growth projects that we want to fund and keep our leverage ratios kind of in line with where we want them to be, but not being in a place where we have to do something.
Faisel Khan: Okay.
Joe Bob Perkins: We sure do not want it to sound formulaic.
Matthew Meloy: Right.
Joe Bob Perkins: $1 billion referred was a critical move for us that got us in that comfort zone. It really did. It got us in the comfort zone. Look at the metrics right after that was announced.
Matthew Meloy: Right.
Joe Bob Perkins: And raising $250 million of equity, you can think of that as pre-funding some of our CapEx because as we are going to as we deploy profitable, attractive return CapEx, that's going to be handled with some mix of debt and equity. Once again, we're not trying to drive to a formula. And we're going to take care of our balance sheet and we're going to raise equity as we spend capital.
Faisel Khan: Okay. But it sounds like for the rest of the capital program, you'd prefer to use mostly equity to fund it rather than use the balance sheet. That's what it seems like - I'm hearing from you guys.
Matthew Meloy: I'd say it really just - it depends on the environment that we're in. It depends on what our growth prospects look like. It depends on the - what our EBITDA for the current quarter, next quarter, next 12 months looks like. So we try and look at multiple - as we said before, whether we're talking about outlooks for guidance and other things, we look at multiple environments, multiple scenarios and say where do we feel comfortable and then we'll make that decision. So it's not as formulaic [indiscernible] we think we don't or we think we do need to. We'll see how the rest of the year plays out with EBITDA, crude oil prices, where TRGP is trading and the like and just make that decision.
Joe Bob Perkins: Our debt is trading at a reasonable cost of capital. We certainly had the appetite in the bank markets. It's a combination.
Matthew Meloy: Yeah.
Faisel Khan: Okay. I got it. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Brandon Blossman of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is open.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning.
Brandon Blossman: Good morning, guys.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hey, good morning.
Brandon Blossman: I'll take advantage of Scott being there and ask Shneur's question again in a slightly different way. So clearly, a little bit of a hiccup here on the LPG export story. But I want to put that aside and think longer term, and I guess, again, ask how the - how your customers are thinking about again longer-dated - we have a little bit of strength in propane pricing here and perhaps putting the U.S. product a little bit at a disadvantage. I'm assuming that, that changes. And I think, at least on our side, we expect that will going forward. Global demand is still strong. So U.S. supply kind of full and cheap, relatively cheap. Global demand, strong. Talking 2018-plus, where do you think customers are thinking that terminal fees are going to end up with the bookends kind of current spot pricing and kind of historic first out-of-the-gate contracting rates?
Scott Pryor: Well, first off, I would tell you that I agree with a lot of your intro there relative to what the market is looking like long term in terms of demand, in terms of supply coming from the U.S. Certainly, pricing is going to have to have an impact, whether pricing comes up internationally or prices in the U.S. are lower to stimulate and encourage exports out of the U.S. because it will happen. There is no doubt - I'm going to try to - I'll cover it from a couple of different perspectives. First off, the short-term environment we're in today is a challenge, as I said earlier. And when you look at that, it is having an influence over how people view the long-term prognosis of adding contracts on the water. But I do believe that eventually pricing will reflect what a true supply-demand forecast looks like and that is, it's growing in the Americas. It's growing globally in Asia. And as a result of that, and with lower shipping fees today, when you look at the Baltic rates, are the lowest I've seen probably ever in my current position, that is all going to help encourage marketers on the water, consumers at the destination points to take a position on shipping. Today, they're a little reluctant because they don't know where the bottom is, but I think we're kind of seeing where the bottom is. And as a result of that, that will stimulate opportunities to have long-term discussions on contracts that will put us out to long-dated positions. Again, I think, for us, our focal point is going to continue to be what we're doing in the Americas, and we've got a nice position there. Our flexibility has been proven. I think if you pulled all of our customers, they are very appreciative of how we have worked with the challenges in the marketplace. And I don't think we'll have any issues extending contracts for the long term.
Brandon Blossman: Okay. Definitely appreciate that color. Switching gears, Joe Bob, you reminded folks that you have real commodity leverage that will show up here fairly quickly, particularly relative to the peer group. You care to update at all or at least directionally update the commodity sensitivities that you put out last year?
Matthew Meloy: We're taking a look at that. I think, in the presentation, we're putting in the updated sensitivity tables, so you'll see that in our presentation.
Brandon Blossman: Okay, well, then that's easy. That all for me. Thank you, guys.
Joe Bob Perkins: We figured we had it. It wasn't that hard for some people to back into it. We might as well get the math right.
Brandon Blossman: That will be much appreciated. Thanks.
Joe Bob Perkins: All right.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Darren Horowitz of Raymond James. Your line is open.
Darren Horowitz: Joe Bob, if I could, for my first question, I want to go back to the comments that you made regarding the Field G&P volume growth expectations. Specifically, in West Texas, if this recovery scenario that we're forecasting you alluded to ends up playing out, how do you think the pace of producer activity, specifically around Versado and your core Delaware assets, results or puts you on a glide path to with regard to second half 2015 Field G&P volumes versus where you guys are through the first half?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, I - we had a little bit of lull. We built some facilities. We've got some available capacity in that area. I like the prospects of future glide path without - it's up into the right without telling you exactly how fast it'll occur because that will be price-dependent. But what we've seen is producers position themselves and we positioned ourselves for a nice little run there. And if it's on the upside of the range of those runs, we'll figure out ways to add capacity. If it's slow and steady, we got capacity for a bit and we just have to add a little pipe and add a little compression. Either way, it's an attractive return for us and we'll try to meet those producer needs.
Darren Horowitz: When you're talking to the producers, Joe Bob, has anything changed in terms of the timing or magnitude of some those drilled but uncompleted wells?
Joe Bob Perkins: Kind of across all basins.
Darren Horowitz: Specifically in West Texas.
Joe Bob Perkins: What I find interesting in all basins, and it's true in West Texas, too, is that as you're talking to customers, you may have two customers with a similar position on docks, in a similar area, and they may be making different decisions. That's a function of different outlooks, different hedges, whether they've got rigs contracted. Potentially, even where they are with their boards, and I think that's kind of understandable in this still kind of choppy environment. So we just try to meet each individual producer's needs, keep our thumb on the pulse of what they're getting ready to do. Some of our producers are more open with us than others. And we're - that's our job. It's not as easy as it has been in the past sometimes because they change their programs and change their budgets. But the rigs that are running in the middle of July are running in the middle of July and those benefit assets that are available for Targa. Longer term, I think that those trends continue with just a little bit of wind in the sails of increased commodity prices.
Darren Horowitz: Last question for me. Back to your commentary around the frac volume upside. How much of that sequential frac volume upside in the second quarter was due specifically to higher Field G&P throughput versus incremental ethane recovery? And really more important, how has that composition shifted thus far in the third quarter with this near-term headwind we're seeing on ethane prices likely diminishing recovery incentive?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes. Thus far in the third quarter. As we've commented in the past, processers in general, and whoever's making the election, ethane recovery rejection decisions occur all the time. You should assume that they're driven by economics. And some of those economics for our customers and other processors or for Targa are driven by what are contractual obligations and what are the time periods for those contractual obligations relative to cost calculations. Yes, you can watch the spot prices move or even estimate the locational spot prices, and that'll give you an indication of what's supposed to be happening. Contractual obligations change some of that. We haven't said, and I don't think you can extract from our numbers, how much of that report-to-report benefit was from increased inlet volumes and how much was from ethane. Obviously, we have a little bit more information. We're describing it as sum of each and it's not immaterial on either side of that. And then the kind of the last part of your question was, looking forward, directionally, not for the first partial month of the quarter, but for over the next year or so or two, we expect more ethane rejection. That's - sorry, I said it wrong, more ethane extraction. That is supposed to happen to keep up with the increased demand caused by the pet chems coming up and caused by ethane exports, but any particular month can swing around.
Darren Horowitz: Thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Selman Akyol of Stifel. Your line is open.
Selman Akyol: Thank you. Good morning.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning.
Selman Akyol: Just a couple quick questions. One small one. On the Bakken pipeline that you referred to the 26 miles, when do you expect that to come online? And how quickly do you expect that to ramp and fill?
Joe Bob Perkins: The ramp and fill to the 13,000 barrels per day will be instantaneous, almost instantaneous. You have to get the LAX program, okay, hooked up and programmed. It's existing production - it's existing production somewhat down the decline curve, so it will be there with lower decline rates. And it's available. It's been waiting. It's been waiting on Indian reservation right away, okay?
Selman Akyol: Got it.
Joe Bob Perkins: The project is beginning. It won't take long. And it will be done before the freeze. But beyond that, I don't think - frankly, I don't have Danny here at the table or I'd be able to tell you the month. But it's pretty soon.
Selman Akyol: Very good. And then I know Matt that you guys are committing some capital, but can you talk about or give a little more color on what you're seeing in the STACK and the SCOOP plays?
Joe Bob Perkins: There's parts of the SCOOP and the STACK that are still pretty active. You can see that from the maps we put in our investor presentation. And that's encouraging. Our assets better serve the SCOOP right now. We've got one large customer who gets their process through bankruptcy. They're likely to be more active, but we're not counting on that until they do and I wish them luck. Our assets can get to the STACK and we are in discussions with folks nearby in the STACK. Pat McDonie is on the line. He's not in the same office due to a conflict. Pat, do you have anything you want to add to that.
Patrick McDonie: I think, Joe Bob, you covered it pretty well. I guess I would say, when you say we have assets on the edge of the STACK, we have assets on the edge of STACK with recent acreage dedications moving us closer and closer to the core of the STACK. And we've picked up some nice acreage covering good rock, good contractual terms with strong producers. And those wells are being drilled, as we speak, and the results are good. So we're heading in the right direction with expectations.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Pat. I didn't give you proper introduction. That's Pat McDonie, Executive Vice President of our Southern Field Gathering and Processing. That's everything other than the Bakken.
Selman Akyol: Thank you so much.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Danilo Juvane of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Danilo Juvane: Thanks for taking my question. I just want to understand one dynamic about LPG exports. Are the volumes going to Latin America actually being consumed in Latin America? Or is the ultimate destination still Asia? Do you guys have a sense for that?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, absolutely. There's not a whole lot of people shipping stuff into Latin America and then shipping it to Asia.
Danilo Juvane: Okay. All right. That's it for me. Thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.
Craig Shere: Hi, good afternoon.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hey. Good afternoon.
Craig Shere: So Scott, you had mentioned a couple of times that you thought that there was a bit of a dislocation in terms of the LPG export pricing versus long-term supply-demand trends. You had mentioned specifically to Brandon, I think, that you saw indications of bottom or you could see where there was a bottom. Is there anything not specific in terms of - to the penny pricing in any way, shape or form? But just in terms of trends from the first quarter to second quarter to the third quarter, do you see a sequential LP export unit pricing still weakening or starting to find specific floors?
Scott Pryor: Well, first off, when you talked about bottoming out, what I referred to was the shipping market because we're seeing shipping rates today at some of the lowest levels that I've ever seen.
Craig Shere: Okay.
Scott Pryor: Again, that's - when you look at the Baltic rates, which kind of sets a benchmark for global shipping prices hovering around $24 per metric ton price for Baltic rates. So those are very low in comparison to what we saw, say, mid-last summer, where we were clearly above $100 per metric ton. So shipping is going in a favorable direction for all those who wish to place barrels on the water and reach a variety of destinations. I forgot the second part of your question. Was it in reference to where we think bottoming out would be on pricing?
Craig Shere: What are you seeing and if there's not a lot of - if you're seeing some contracting? Are you continuing to see weakness versus last quarter or a couple of quarters ago in terms of that pricing? Is there continuing pressure? And any kind of comment about the spot market, just in terms of recent trends, nothing specific in terms of dollars?
Scott Pryor: Yes, we are continuing to add some contracts. We are - I would say, the spot market price that you hear anecdotally in the marketplace seems - is obviously down. And that's what I would refer to as the resell market where folks are taking their stems and they're evaluating what they're lifting price would be versus a cancellation price versus what they might be able to get on an open spot market, albeit a very thinly-traded market. Again, I think it's important to note that most customers, the large, vast majority of our customers are lifting. And they are not having issues in the marketplace. But there are a number of folks, there are some that are spot selling, if you will, they're lifting at numbers to try to manage their economic impact relative to the cancellation fee that they'd have to pay to us or others.
Craig Shere: Okay.
Joe Bob Perkins: I also think that in your question, you correctly reflect it that it's a very short-term focus. That's a short-term balancing mechanism, as Scott described, on the margin. Longer term, and I know it's very, very difficult to talk beyond the next quarter or the next portion of a quarter, but longer term, the dynamics are positive for Targa and for our continued export business that's necessary to balance supply and demand.
Craig Shere: Understood. Appreciate that, Joe Bob. And any updates around longer-term opportunities with LPG - well, with the ethylene and/or ethane export prospects?
Scott Pryor: In terms of ethylene or ethane, I think we've described in the past that we have a project that is engineered and designed for ethane exports. In today's current environment, I think it would be very difficult to get long-term contracts to support ethane exports with the current projects that are coming online today. With that said, if the market does materialize over a long term, pricing is supportive, both U.S. prices for ethane to be exported, we can certainly look at that. In terms of ethylene, as you guys know, currently today, in North America, we have the one facility that can export ethylene from our dock. It is supported by a long-term relationship that we have with a petrochemical customer of ours. And that is long-standing and continuing. And they are exporting today ethylene, as you guys are aware of. Abilities to enhance that with that relationship, those are constant and ongoing discussions because if the market over time is going to develop and ethylene is going to be exported, you have to evaluate that versus the derivatives market that could be exported. So when you look at those in combination, we'll be in that discussion and we'll be in the possibilities of looking at things that can enhance our facilities to accommodate any potential growing demand.
Craig Shere: And on the ethylene front, in order to expand that opportunity, that's a dramatically lower CapEx position than what you had laid out originally with ethane. Is that correct?
Scott Pryor: It depends upon the size. It's all relevant to what sort of volumes you're going to be looking at. So wouldn't be in a position to describe those today, but just know that we'll be looking at opportunities like that. But you are right. It is a capital-intensive project when you look at a sizable ethane export facility versus an already established facility today that can export ethylene and how you can increase the capacity of that and enhance that is likely a much, much smaller capital investment.
Craig Shere: Great. And on the projects that aren't broken out that are smaller projects that were referred to in the prepared remarks, the CapEx to EBITDA is really exceptional, isn't it? Is there some kind of average range that you could give on those smaller projects?
Joe Bob Perkins: I think he characterized it.
Matthew Meloy: As pretty good. We've said for our projects, five to seven times EBITDA is a reasonable multiple to assume. And then usually for the items not listed on that page in our presentation, the smaller project is usually at the low end, if not better than the five times.
Craig Shere: Okay. And last question on the maintenance CapEx.
Joe Bob Perkins: As an example, we talked about the pipeline to get 13,000 barrels instantaneously and for a long time. You all could run that the economics on that look pretty good.
Craig Shere: Understood.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yeah.
Craig Shere: And the last question on maintenance CapEx. What were the drivers for coming lower for the year? And is that sustainable into 2017?
Joe Bob Perkins: Well, our guys, our teams, our people have been working on cost reduction for multiple years now, okay, and are figuring out ways to do things smarter and cheaper without ever, okay, without ever compromising preventative maintenance or safety. They continue to make progress on those things and I'm very proud of that. Now at the same time, people who have followed us for a long time would say that we usually put in preventative maintenance with a - I'm sorry, we usually put in maintenance CapEx with a bit of conservatism. And it's a pretty good bet to say that you would take the under on the maintenance CapEx numbers we put out there. We do spend more in the fourth quarter than we do the rest of the year, but you heard Matt's soft comment, $90 million or perhaps less. I would take the under on $90 million, and our history would say to take the under on $90 million. Now how do we keep taking care of cost reductions like that? In the maintenance capital category, I'm giving you one example. Throughout Targa's history, we have expanded our ability to do our own compressor reworks in our own shops instead of with third parties. It improves quality dramatically and it reduces costs. We recently purchased another facility, okay, with the same supervision that's been leading this effort over the long term, but in Midland, where we can attract the people we need easier than where they were having to drive before. That reduces cost. They drive it into their plans and forecast, they drive it into the systems that take care of it and that's just one of the ways. Lower cost, higher quality, better service, greater timeliness, a really good thing. And I'm just happy I got to talk about that.
Craig Shere: That sounds pretty sustainable. Is that a fair summary of what you just said?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes. The cost savings programs that these guys are doing are going down to root cause analysis, the maintenance facility, sustainability, and bravo for those teams.
Craig Shere: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you and our next question is from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jeremy Tonet: Good morning.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning.
Jeremy Tonet: Thanks for all the color today. Just wanted to ask kind of a high-level strategic question, it seems like there's been a good amount of asset rationalization in the midstream space and there's been some consolidation. And I'm just wondering, is there a bigger role for Targa to play in that or is the focus really kind of the internal opportunity set and just kind of the singles and doubles that you guys outlined there in repairing the balance sheet?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. Right now, I think we see a lot of opportunity in and around our assets, where maybe some of the other, whether it's the E&P companies or other midstream companies, aren't spending the capital that we're spending to serve our producers and customers' needs. So I think we see a lot of good investment opportunities in and around our assets. So that's really where we're going to be focusing on acquisitions. I think if you see acquisitions from us, it's likely going to smaller bolt-on in and around areas where we are. We're not necessarily looking to get into new geographic areas and expand our footprint. We're in a lot of the attractive basins, and we like that - we like the basins we're in.
Jeremy Tonet: Great, thanks for that. That's it for me.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Joe Bob Perkins, for any further remarks.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you, operator and thanks to everyone for patience on the call. I look at the time. I was kind of surprised. So I guess, we were at least having a good conversation. If you have any further conversation - I mean, conversation - any further questions, if you start thinking about the conversation we just had and want to clarify anything, Jen, Matt, myself, any of us, are available if you'd like to give us a call. Thanks a lot, and have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-04-29 10:30:00) =====
Executives: Chris McEwan - VP & Treasurer Joe Bob Perkins - CEO Matthew Meloy - CFO
Analysts: Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt Darren Horowitz - Raymond James TJ Schultz - RBC Capital Markets Faisel Khan - Citigroup Jeff Birnbaum - Wunderlich Jarren Holder - Goldman Sachs Chris Sighinolfi - Jefferies John Edwards - Credit Suisse Sunil Sibal - Seaport Global Securities Helen Ryoo - Barclays
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Targa Resources First Quarter 2016 Earnings Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Chris McEwan, Vice President and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin.
Chris McEwan: Thank you, Crystal. I'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2016 investor call for Targa Resources Corp. Before we get started I'd like to mention that Targa Resources Corp., Targa TRC or the company has published its earnings release which is available on our website, www.targaresources.com. We will also be posting an updated investor presentation to the website later today. I would also like to remind you that on February 17, Targa Resources Corp closed its acquisition of all the outstanding public common units of Targa Resources Partners LP, TRP, that it did not already own. So on this call we will be discussing results as one entity, Targa Resources Corp. Please note that we will occasionally refer to the term GPL to refer to Targa Pipeline, the rename of former Atlas assets because our reported financial show comparisons back to Q1 of 2015 when we owned GPL for one month. Any statements made during this call that might include the company's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor Provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Please note that actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings, including the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Joe Bob Perkins, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Meloy, Chief Financial Officer; will be our speakers today. Other members of the management team are available to assist in the Q&A session. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Bob Perkins.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Chris. Good morning. And thanks to everyone for participating. Does not seem that long ago that we were reporting fourth quarter results. But a lot has changed and the short two months since the last call for Targa and for the entire energy industry. For Targa, we hosted our fourth quarter call shortly after closing the buy-in of the MLP. And also shortly after announcing the $500 million preferred private placement. Since then we announced that we upsized the private placement and had raised an attractive $1 billion of capital, in total, that we used reduce indebtedness. We also just completed the first quarter that we are proud off. With continued strong commercial and operational performance, and focus on savings, that resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $265 million and 1.2x dividend coverage. More broadly, let's discuss the commodity, equity and debt market volatility that we have seen through the first four months of this year. Since early first quarter lows, and based on yesterdays close, crude prices have rallied more than 75%. NGL prices have increased more than 55%, and natural gas prices have increased about 10%. However, the uncertainties for our industry remain high. Significant price uncertainty remains. And since our last earnings call, just a couple of months ago, the domestic land rig count has continued to decrease from 489 to 405. And as audience on this call today undoubtedly knows, EMP companies are still figuring out what they will do for the rest of the year. We are trying to stay close to our EMP customers but they do not really have much new information to share with since this time two months ago, when we told you they were still reeling from there instances where crude had dipped below $30 a barrel. Just as the commodity prices improved, so have the capital markets improved over the last two months since our last call. Again, based on yesterdays close, the Alerian MLP Index went from 244 to almost 300, reflecting an improving outlook for the broad MLP sector, and for the midstream industry even though Targa is no longer in the index. And Targa's common stock price went from $22.13 to yesterday’s close of $38.71. At the same time, our senior notes went from trading in the 70s to trading at about par. Of course these improved levels are a good thing from our perspective, and from our perspective it's been a welcome change to see the commodity and capital market recently versus the first quarter lows. But as I said, there continues to be uncertainty for entire industry. All of the significant next steps that we have taken since the commodity prices started to fall in November 2014, position Targa to be successful and almost any environment. Those steps of course include our reduced CapEx spending, our significantly OpEx and G&A uncertainties, we have positioned Targa to succeed in almost any environment and we will continue to work to improve that position. Turning now to our first quarter results. We reported first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $265 million, modestly higher than last year's reported adjusted EBITDA which included only one month of TPO volume and margins. Year-over-year headwinds resulted from reduced commodity prices and challenging market conditions. Our logistics and marketing segment produced quarterly reported operating margin of $157 million versus $191 million for the previous year. Lower as a result of the partial recognition last year, the renegotiated commercial arrangement related to our crude and condensate splitter project with Noble, lower fractionation margin, and lower export margin. We reported approximately 5.5 million barrels per month of LPGs for the first quarter of this year, which positions us well to meet or exceed our previous stated expectation of at least 5 million barrels per month for 2016. LPG exports have been particularly popular investor topic over the last month or so. As more bullish domestic NGL price sentiment has begun to emerge, and the potential impact on domestic propane supplying exports has been hotly [ph] discussed. While Mount Belvieu LPG prices are obviously key drivers for export demand, a number of other important variables must also be considered including global LPG demand, global LPG prices, particularly, in the Middle East, where LPG supply is declining. Global shipping rates, local global shipping rates, locational advantages of U.S. Gulf Coast supply, especially for the Americas market, and infrastructure growth throughout the world. Commercially the pace of dialogue around long-term contracts is picking up. Perhaps largely as a result of market perception that shipping rates are bottoming out. As evidenced by the large majority of ships leaving from Targa's facility and staying in the Western hemisphere, Targa has advantage in exporting LPGs to Latin America, South America, and the Caribbean. And those markets tend to be priced on U.S. LPG prices. Our facility has proven customer flexibility due to our multiple docs with service of variety of vessel sizes and with simultaneously low propane and butane products. These attributes are valued by existing and potential new customers. Another recent topic of interest is ethylene exports. Targa does not currently export ethylene, and we only provide ethylene loading or unloading services for one customer. We have an arrangement with CP Chem whereby we operate assets owned by CP Chem at our Galena Park facility, and CP Chem exports ethylene from one of our docks. Targa receives a fee in exchange for operating the assets and providing access. While perhaps well positioned, we do not currently have any plans for expansion of our ethylene services. Moving to field GMP, for field GMP which is now subdivided as Permian, Central and Badlands, we expect average 2016 natural gas volumes to be about flat versus average 2015 natural gas volumes. For natural gas we continue to expect Permian natural gas volumes to be up year-over-year, offset by declines in the Central, with Badlands also about flat. We also expect that Badlands crude volumes will be about flat for 2016 versus 2015. Distributable cash flow for the quarter was $180 million, and quarterly dividend coverage was approximately 1.2x. Based on our first quarter declared dividend of $0.91 per common share, a $3.64 on an annual basis. This was the second consecutive quarter where we maintained Targa's quarterly dividend at $0.91 per common share. And our rational for our recommendation to the Board this quarter was very similar to the last quarter. From our perspective, we have taken some very important steps to strengthen Targa and those steps mean that we have the luxury to be able to continue to monitor commodity and financial markets, the actions of our customers, and the actions of our competitors just as it didn’t make sense last quarter, growing their quarterly dividend this quarter in the face of continued uncertainty. Also didn't make sense to management or to our Board. Similarly, making a rash decision to meaningfully change our quarterly dividend didn't feel appropriate to us or the Board. Consistent with how we always approach quarterly dividend declarations, our ongoing analysis involves multiple commodity price and volume scenarios within a multi-year framework. We decided to stay flat. We have recently seen a number of midstream companies, to resize their payouts and that trend may continue. For Targa, we will continue to assess the environment and opportunities in front of us. And will continue to examine our place in the world as a midstream seacorp [ph]. Remember, the target is a midstream seacorp that does not currently pay taxes and is not expected to pay taxes for the near and medium term. We have time to be patient and thoughtful with our first priority obviously being the health of our balance sheet. That will wrap up my initial comments and I'll hand it over to Matt.
Matthew Meloy: Thanks, Joe Bob. I'd like to add my welcome and thank you for joining our call today. Before we turn to discussing our first quarter results in more detail, I would like to describe some changes that we made to our reporting which you may have noticed in our press release this morning. We now report our results in towards segments; gathering and processing, and logistics and marketing. As Targa has increased its scale, geographic presence and diversification of operations, we have re-evaluated our financial reporting segmentations and believe that these two segment convention is more appropriate. Gathering and processing now includes both our field G&P business units and our G&P business. Our logistics and marketing segment, which we also refer to as downstream, includes both the former logistics asset and marketing and distribution segments. We will continue to provide some operational information at the business level or group business unit level. Within the gathering and processing segment, we are continuing to report the same individual system operating results. You will notice that we added some logical groping. SAOU, West Sand hills and Bersato [ph], are collectively described as Permian, and collectively I believe they represent the best position Permian, gathering and processing business in the industry. We have completed initial interconnections of SAOU, West and Sand hills improving our capabilities to operate efficiently and provide our producer customers with flexibility. Our operations personal have also realigned responsibilities across these three business units to improve efficiencies and service for our customers. South Texas, North Texas, South Stoke and West Stoke are collectively described as Central, and Badland and Coastal remain as standalone reporting systems; and the aggregate Permian, Central and Badlands will continue to be characterized as field gathering and processing. For downstream, we collapsed logistic asset and marketing and distribution into one reporting segment which we believe should be helpful. For example; on the previous state we had export margin split across the reporting segments. Now turning to quarterly results; as mentioned, reported adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $265 million, compared to $258 million for the same time period last year. The modest increase was driven by the addition of TPL volumes and margins offset by lower commodity prices, lower fractionation and export margins, and by the partial recognition last year or our renegotiated commercial arrangements related to our crude and condensate splitter project with noble. Overall, reported operating margin was approximately flat for the first quarter compared to the first quarter of last year. Reported net maintenance capital expenditures were $13 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $19 million in the first quarter of 2015. Turning to the segment level, I'll summarize the first quarter's performance on a year-over-year basis starting with the downstream segment. First quarter operating margin decreased 18% compared to the first quarter of 2015 as a result of the partial recognition in '15, the renegotiated commercial arrangements related to our splitter project with noble, lower fractionation margins and lower export margins. As Joe Bob mentioned, we loaded an average of 5.5 million barrels per month of LPG exports for the quarter compared to 5.8 million barrels per month during the first quarter of 2015. Fractionation volumes decreased by 13% in the first quarter of 2016 versus same time period last year. As a result of lower supply volumes in Mont Belvieu and some contract roll-offs in 2015, none of which has occurred thus far in the first quarter of 2016. Related to future contract rollovers, we want to reiterate what we said last quarter which is that over the next three years, less than 5% of progress fractionation contracts expire and less than 10% expire over the next five years. Logistics and marketing segment reported operating expenses decreased by 3% in the first quarter of 2016 versus the same time period last year as a result of both continued cost saving efforts and lower fuel and power cost. Now turning to the gathering and processing segment. Reported operating margin increased by 33% compared to last year, primarily because last year's results include only one month of volumes and margins from TPL operations versus a full quarter contribution this year, plus a full quarter of operations of our Little Missouri 3 natural gas processing plant in the Badlands which came online in the first quarter of 2015. First quarter reported 2016 natural gas inlet volumes for field, gathering and processing were a little bit 2.5 billion cubic feet per day. For the gathering and processing segment, condensate prices were 37% lower, natural gas prices were 34% lower and NGL prices were 29% lower compared to the first quarter of 2015. Crude oil gathered increased to 105 barrels per day in the first quarter, a 4% increase versus the same time period last year. Quarter-over-quarter Badlands crude oil volumes were down about 3%, largely a result of producers shutting in existing production to frac new wells or for work overs. And as Joe Bob mentioned, we expect volumes to be flat versus - for 2016 versus average 2015. Related to operating expenses we continue to focus on cost reductions across all of our assets excluding the additional operating expenses from the TPL acquisition and system expansion, most areas were significantly lower than last year due to a focused cost reduction effort. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we benefited from some one-time reported reductions to OpEx but through our continued cost reduction efforts. Efforts, we were able to replicate a similar OpEx number for the first quarter. Let's now move to capital structure and liquidity. On March 16 we announced that we closed on the sale of approximately $1 billion of 9.5% Series A issuing 965,100 newly authorized shares of Series A preferred stock and also issuing 13.55 million warrants with a strike price of $18.88 per common share, and 6.5 million warrants with a strike price of $25.11 per common share. The proceeds were used to reduce overall indebtedness at Targa, and importantly positions us in a time of opportunity to be able to execute on impactful projects. As of March 31, we had no borrowings under TRP's $1.6 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due October 2017. With outstanding letters of credit of $12 million, availability at quarter end was approximately $1.6 billion. At quarter-end we had borrowings of $150 million under our accounts receivable securitization facility. On a debt compliance basis, TRPs leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was approximately 3.5x versus a compliance covenant of 5.5x. As of March 31, TRC had $275 million in borrowings, outstanding under its $670 million senior secured credit facility that matures in February 2020. In the balance on TRC's term loan facility that matures in February 2022 was $160 million. We mentioned this on our last earnings call and have provided detail on our leverage picture and our investor presentations but I also want to reiterate that there is no maintenance covenant related to consolidated leverage in our credit facilities. Our fee-based operating margin for the first quarter of 2016 was 77%, and we continue to expect operating margin to be more than 70% fee-based during 2016. Turning to hedges for non-fee based operating margin relative to the partnerships current estimate of equity volumes from field, gathering and processing. We estimate we have hedged approximately 50% of remaining 2016 natural gas, 50% of remaining 2016 condensate, and approximately 20% of remaining 2016 NGL volumes. For 2017 we estimate we have hedged approximately 35% of natural gas, 35% of condensate and approximately 10% of NGL volumes. Moving on to capital spending, we estimate $525 million or less for net growth capital expenditures in 2016, $110 million of net maintenance capital expenditures for the year. As it relates to taxes, our expectation is that Targa will not be paying cash taxes for at least five years as we benefit from depreciation associated with a step up in basis from the Atlas mergers and the buying of TRP; and it's our expectation that Targa dividends for 2016 will likely be classified as a return of capital, possibly as much as 100% return of capital. That concludes my review and I will now turn the call back over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you, Matt. I will now provide some additional color related to growth capital projects and then we'll wrap it up so that we can have some Q&A. First, our primary 2016 growth capital projects, once listed in our recent investor presentations are proceeding well. Downstream, Train5 is in startup mode at this time consistent with our original timeline, and expect Train5 to be fully operational by the end of the second quarter. As mentioned previously, Train5 was underwritten by our own needs for additional fractionation capacity based on projected equity volume growth from our field GMP operations. And we expect that Train5 will fill up more slowly than initially expected. We recently executed an EPC contract for our crude and condensate splitter project at channel views terminal, and now expect total growth CapEx for the project to be approximately $140 million. The splitter will likely be operational in the first quarter of 2018. Our gathering and processing segment, our 200 million cubic feet a day Buffalo plant in West Tex is also in the final stages of startup, providing much needed processing capacity and increasing system reliability and operational flexibility. We expect it to be fully operational within the next couple of weeks. As part of our joint venture with Sanchez Energy in South Texas, we also completed the Carnero pipeline in March which facilitated the first quarter volume growth that we saw in South Texas. As volumes from Sanchez Energy flowed from the Carnero pipeline to Targa's existing Silver Oak facilities. Volumes in South Texas increased by about 25% in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter to more than 175 million cubic feet per day, as we received additional volumes from Sanchez earlier than we originally expected. We expect that volumes will continue to increase over 2016. Construction on the joint ventures new 200 million cubic feet per day raptor plant in SAOU County is underway, and we expect it will be operational during the first quarter of 2017. When we announced our joint venture with Sanchez in October 2015, we announced that Sanchez was underwriting the joint venture projects with a minimum volume commitment of 125 million cubic feet per day that begins in the first quarter of 2017 and lasts for five years. This is the only material non-investment grade, minimum volume commitment across our gathering and processing footprint. Using that as a segue to another important topic on investors' minds, we continue to closely monitor our customer credit exposures on a customer-by-customer and contract-by-contract basis. Of course we are operating on high alert related to customer credit exposure and continue to believe that we are well positioned to manage the risks associated with potential counter party, default or bankruptcy. We will continue to stress our forecast, stress our analysis with full consideration to credit risk and a lower commodity price environments just as we constantly try to assess the volume implications of those same prices scenarios. Over the first four months of this year, there have been some announced bankruptcies, rating agency downgrades, and other material E&P announcement. But for Targa, none of the announced situations has had or is expected to have a significant impact on us. Moving onto some closing remarks. I continue to be incredibly proud of our employees and our accomplishments through challenging times. Our finance team, with help from many other parts of the company raised $1 billion of capital through a preferred plus warrant structure that they designed with a fundamental view that Targa was undervalued and that there were investors that would partner with Targa sharing that same fundamental view which will allow us to raise attractive capital. It did, and we welcome those investors. Our engineering and operations team have continued to identify and share best practices to reduce cost and manage dollar spend without sacrificing safety or the integrity of our assets. Our commercial teams have also continued to identify and share best practices related to contract renegotiations and additional opportunities across and between the businesses. And as expected, despite uncertainties we are continuing to work on attractive potential projects across all of our business areas, leveraging our strengths and our positioning and demanding attractive returns. Every employee at Targa has had a hand in responding to the challenges of this energy cycle and trying to rise to the occasion in their own way, in their own role, to position Targa for success. We kept collaboration that I've seen throughout the company has resulted in better bottom line results than expected, and has better positioned Targa for the future. In the face of uncertainty, those employees have demonstrated a focus and resiliency at all levels of the company and it makes me proud. And I would like to take the opportunity to thank each and every one of our employees for their continued efforts. So with that, we'll open it up to questions. I'll turn it back to you operator.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brandon Blossman from Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Company. Your line is now open.
Brandon Blossman: Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Joe Bob. I'll take it off LPG question, probably at top of everybody's mind as pointed out. In a world that may have increasing demand globally and decreasing supply, probably globally and in the U.S. How do your terminals fare and what is that look like on the ground in terms of contracting both contract roles and reconstructing those historic rates?
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks for the question, Brandon. Adding some color to our carefully prepared remarks. We will good about our position, you're asking about our position in that global market. The supply demand variables that I talked about, Targa is well positioned for Gulf Coast propane and butane supply. And we think that Targa and a very few others, well positioned in that market, are well positioned for the global economy. You will see in our investor presentation that over the last 12 months, three quarters of our LPGs are going to Latin America, South America and the Caribbean. That's driven by factors different than some of the variables that people spend a lot of time looking at. We feel good about that for the near-term and the longer term, forget about our position of Mont Belvieu related LPGs and our natural share of that.
Brandon Blossman: Fair enough. Any thoughts about where current spot rates are for lower LPG terminals?
Joe Bob Perkins: It's a dynamic market. We said publicly in the last call that spot rates were certainly lower than the spot post rates enjoyed couple of years ago. I think other people on recent calls have made the same comment but they are not unattractive and the product, services, flexibility that we're providing our have continued interest or sport but also can turn you interest for term contracting.
Brandon Blossman: All right, switching topic, that looks like you time to death buybacks very nicely here. What's the expectation on a go-forward basis, was this opportunistic or is there something structural going here?
Joe Bob Perkins: With the $1 billion proceeds we received, it just made sense for us to go out and repurchase our notes, that's more attractive than just paying down revolver and we ran out of revolver capacity. So, it made sense for us to do that. We also had the $1.1 billion maturity out there in January 2018, so we wanted to just begin repaying that to reduce that size down. We've started doing that really late last year through the first quarter and we've actually continued doing some of that in April this year, too. We've repaid and you'll see it in the press release, repurchased another $96 million post-quarter end of those notes and the balance on that $1.1 billion is now about $840 million. So we feel good about where we are.
Brandon Blossman: Okay. And we'll just see what happens going forward?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. That's right.
Brandon Blossman: All right. Thank you, guys.
Matthew Meloy: Thanks, Brian.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Darren Horowitz from Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Darren Horowitz: Good morning, Joe Bob. My first question: within the comments that you made around the fuel GMP volumes - and I recognize as you said that as you said, that customers don't have any much more to tell you relative to what they told you a few months ago - but if we look across the forward curve and just for a second think the commodity prices materialized, consistent with that outlines, if you think about the different drivers within fuel GMP, where do you think there could be a bit more volume upside? Is it specifically within west sectors around the Permian, around Versado, or across the Midland system, or do you think maybe the magnitude of Central and Badlands' volume declined just in a state?
Joe Bob Perkins: It is a good question brand and I obviously felt better about the forward curve today than we did two months ago. It is a - and it really was just two months ago. We had our last earnings call. That always surprises me in the first part of the year. Customers are looking at those forward curves. They know their economics very well. It wouldn't surprise me if this is being mocked in per customers for future drilling. That happened about maybe two months later this time last year and I shouldn't be speaking for those producers, but we've tried to stay in very close contact with them. You asked about where there may be more upside based on today's forward curve and I would add - or based on some positive movement of the forward curve in the near future? Yes, Permian Basin has some very sweet spots in it and we are across some of those sweet spots. Probably it would see the most activity increase around the West Texas system as well as further west around Versado, that core Delaware. It's a sweet spot. Secondly, you pointed to the Badlands? Makes a significant difference. If you can get that forward curve, we're a little bit better and how they'll feel about their activity; and then I guess I would go to the scoop. Across that spectrum, there are several places where there are some drilled and uncompleted wells which we may benefit from and additionally, what I like is how producers right now are high-grading into drilling dollars. Drilling close to their own assets which means close to ire's. Upside can come without a whole lot of capital expenditures if it follows the pattern we would expect it to.
Darren Horowitz: Okay, I appreciate the color. My final question, if you could just - I love your thoughts with regard to recoveries, the theory that there's going to be composidential [ph] barrel price improvement, specifically the FA market tightening opportunities for you guys. From a recovery perspective, certainly on if you will, the non-fee based business, what could be the potential for uplifting the back half of this year in terms of POL and POP contract exposure?
Joe Bob Perkins: I think it's a question of when, not if you get price recovery. Did pretty bad on the winds in my career. All of the factors that are well-discussed, we agree with, we try to model as well. You described towards the end of the year? I don't know the timing. It could be then. It certainly has to occur sometime after them, it's just that they're not dynamics of supply and demand and the help that we'll get from exports.
Darren Horowitz: Thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: You're welcome. Thanks, Darren.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from TJ Schultz from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning, TJ.
TJ Schultz: Good morning. Thanks. I guess as far as the move in commodity and your improved cost to capital and balance sheet obviously, is any of that accelerated discussions on projects in your longer term backlog, both as we think about what could potentially be higher in the 2016 bucket above that 525 and then as you think about moving to approval for projects a bit further down the road?
Joe Bob Perkins: I hear you, TJ. It has been a pretty good movement in the last two months on commodity prices and our equity price on improved cost to capital. We're taking a longer term view on our cost to capital. We took that long return view and we preferred. Our project development continues in not just projects that we talked about in the past. I did say and I said it intentionally because I'm proud of the efforts. Across our business areas, call them small projects and larger projects. Not [ph] will be up there on that Nelson project page. Our businesses are working that pipeline. They're working it based on leveraging our asset position, leveraging the strong position we have relative to our financial ability to execute, but also demanding attractive returns. It's just necessary. Because of the uncertainties, we want to make sure that we're getting large bang for our buck and that it has attractive spread over a longer term view of cost to capital that includes the fact that we put billion dollars on our balance sheet of that prefer. The good news is, those projects and opportunities exist. It's kind of a timing issue, customer uncertainties et cetera, but we're working on the pipeline.
TJ Schultz: Okay, thanks. And then I guess in that vein, you touched on ethylene exports. No plans now, you self-familiar are well-positioned. Is that something you may consider down the road as a potential project?
Joe Bob Perkins: Certainly. Actually the reason for putting the comment out there is we've gotten the question so many times. I wanted to clarify the facts. We don't have it in investor presentations and certainly don't like much about it because it's not a big material portion of our business, but it is an important part of our relationship with CPC. That relationship is a one-company relationship right now. They have some assets, we have some assets that support that ethylene business. We did want to clarify that we don't have a project currently planned. Your question is would we ever consider it? We consider everything.
TJ Schultz: Okay, makes sense. Just lastly to fall up on some of the volume discussion. If you could expand a little bit on South Texas, what you're seeing there as you bring those same volumes into the system. It sounds like they came a little sooner and then the pipeline of March. Just your expectations to look at the run rate in the first quarter, kind of what we expect through 2016.
Joe Bob Perkins: Sure. First of all, the coming a little sooner is a specific shout out to the, congratulations, I'm giving all our employees for execution. We got it done sooner than we thought we're going to. Congratulations to that team, but there are many efforts like that going on. Getting that done sooner brought the volumes to us sooner. Sanchez continues to be very, very good a drilling and completing those wells and we expect additional volumes. I do understand that the has ruled over for others and it's not really a growth picture for others, but as we announced when we announced the project, that that does kind of make the tie for Targa better in South Texas. It doesn't fix, but stand alone, it's very attractive. Stand alone, it makes the system better with a plant on the west and a plant on the east, and we're already flowing all the way from the west to the east now with Sanchez' volumes. That's all a good thing for the long term.
TJ Schultz: Okay, thank you.
Matthew Meloy: Thanks.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you. I appreciate it, TJ.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hi, Faisel.
Faisel Khan: Hey, thanks. Good morning. All right. I just want to ask a couple of questions. First off, with all the uncertainty that you talked about in the market, how are you looking at your dividend covered ratio? Is there a long term goal that you sort of envision in this sort of volatile commodity market that works for you, guys?
Joe Bob Perkins: Faisel, I don't have an announced long term goal for the dividend covered ratio right now. Probably the best way to think about target is how we behaved in the past and that we're working very hard to think about the future. I like our track record, I like the current covered ratio and we're going to try to be thoughtful and continue to analyze what other companies are doing, what the investment community is saying and reflecting and what's going on with our customers.
Faisel Khan: Okay, understood. Our prepared remarks, you discussed that there are long-term contracts for LPG export capacity being discussed again. Could you go a little bit more in-depth in what you mean by that? Is that our customers coming back to the table to discuss long term capacity, or is this just sort of…
Joe Bob Perkins: No. I believe either in the Q&A on the last earnings call, I just reflected the color that while counter-parties were interested at needs for a long-term LPGs two months ago, it appeared that they were waiting to figure out what was going to happen with shipping rates and shipping rates have been on a pretty significant trend. Depending on what shipping rates you're looking at, that trend may have bottomed out. I don't want to pretend to be the expert on that, but it may have bottomed out. With that, hey, if we're not at the bottom, we're close to the bottom, or we bottomed out sentiment coming from our contacts in the industry from existing and potential new customers, we've seen an increased interest to go ahead and do term deals again. They didn't want to do that when they weren't prepared to do the term shipping deals. Don't mean to overstate that, but it is different today than it was two months ago - in dialog, in interest, in pace.
Faisel Khan: Okay, makes sense. And then one of the other prepared comments that you said is that you evaluate your place in the world as a sea corp. Can you go on to a little more depth by what do you mean by that? Clearly you've collapsed a structure, you're more simplified now. Is there something that you're contemplating with regards to structure?
Joe Bob Perkins: I think that also came out of - we're not in the Alerian Index anymore - I pointed to the Alerian Index even though we're not in it. We are a seacorp, we have tools to take care of our balance sheet and we want to take care of our balance sheet. However, seacorp doesn't pay any taxes which makes a real difference for our investors. You heard Matt's comments about what that return of capital treatment would look like for 2017. All of that factors into what we're trying to deliver to our investors and how we're trying to deliver it. That's the color around my statement.
Faisel Khan: Okay, understood. I'm just trying to understand, are you happy being a Seacorp or do you want to be something else?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, we're going to switch again. I'm very, very happy with the moves we made and how that positions us for the current environment and the range of environment that could occur over the next several years. It was very important. I may have misspoke on the year a little while ago and I apologize, I said 17 for the return of capital. Matt only described it for 2016. Now I've been distracted. Did I answer your questions?
Faisel Khan: You did, yes. Thank you. I think I'm all set.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Birnbaum from Wunderlich. Your line is now open.
Jeff Birnbaum: Good morning, everyone.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning.
Jeff Birnbaum: Here are just a couple of questions from me. One, just kind of bigger picture - you said you would and it sounds like you've added some more since the fourth quarter call. Just sort of big picture philosophically I guess in a sort of rollercoaster I have been on the last couple of years. I was wondering if you are thinking about hedging policy sort of any different going forward, then perhaps you have in the past?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, targets are give or take 75-ish percent or so year one, 50% year two and then 25-ish percent year 3 and then there are ranges around those. We did add some hedges here recently. We're still well under those targets so as we're adding some hedges, we're not yet going out and adding to try and catch up to get to those target levels or exceed them, but adding those hedges are really more kind of keeping up with those targets to we don't fall further behind. That really relates to the hedges that we put in place, so over really the fourth and the first quarter.
Matthew Meloy: And you asked for policy. I don't mind describing thinking because it's not a policy. Those are targets and goals we've had for a long time. The hedge committee of our board and a management are on the same page and that we do believe there's more upside than downside on most of the commodities that we had and do not see us trying to catch up while that's still the case. Keeping up is productive and that's our current thinking. That thinking could change, but we don't think about it differently than we thought about it over the entire history of Targa and we've got some experienced people helping the management team experience just to stay disciplined - watch it, track it, discuss it at least once a quarter.
Joe Bob Perkins: To add onto too, the hedges we've had been primarily on them say, I'm on a natural gas side of thing. For NGOs, you're going to see we're still well under our targets.
Jeff Birnbaum: Yes, and it all makes sense for me, quick, the potential exercise of the - I just wanted to ask how you are approaching that? Obviously, the stock prices had a very nice run here. I was just sort of wondering, is that something that you see likely when the owners have served the right to do that? Or are you thinking about your capital deployment leverage - things like that, all with that timing in mind?
Joe Bob Perkins: Sure. It is our option to settle those warranty there in cash or net settle them in shares. So it is our option. They cannot be exercised for six months, so there are still some time before those could even be exercised. Good question on when they'll be exercised. Those are seven year warrants, so it will be up to those individual holders whether they decide they want to go ahead and exercise, or if they want to keep the time value. Good question, but we can always net settle in shares, so if we didn't want to pay cash, we didn't want to add leverage to the balance sheet, we could just net settle it.
Jeff Birnbaum: Okay. Perfect. Thanks, man. And then just a real last one for me. Liquidity is pretty strong here. I was just kind of curious - Joe Bob, you touched on sort of how you're thinking about pursuing new projects and things like that. I thought I'd ask just a question on MNA that doesn't get new member. Are you still out there interested in additional assets? Are you seeing any changes in the [ph] disimprovement in liquid's prices or perhaps sellers taking in a bit more?
Joe Bob Perkins: It has only been a couple of months since I commented. I don't think it has changed a lot today versus a couple of months ago. We will still look. Just as we're being very disciplined around the organic projects, one business area at a time, making sure we get attractive returns and the way we do that, it's leveraging our assets, leveraging our position an acquisition that would really get on our radar scope, we'd need to look the same way. Leveraging our assets, leveraging our position. We're spending almost no time looking at the opportunity to increase foot prints. It's just not that time for us right now.
Jeff Birnbaum: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Congrats on the quarter.
Matthew Meloy: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jarren Holder form Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jarren Holder: Hi, good morning. I just want to start off, how sensitive it is Latin American or Caribbean demand for U.S. LPG exports in your view to higher U.S. Prices?
Joe Bob Perkins: It has been a short history, but it hasn't been very sensitive based on U.S. pricing today. It's a demand that needs to be met, it's being met from obviously a very close source of supply and not that we are transacting with the customers in those markets, but it's our sense from our customers that that's based on U.S. LPG pricing. That removes some of that sensitivity. That's probably not the best color I have to and we certainly will see over the next year or two what that's going to be because we've had prices move all over the place, all over tax. We were still shipping. Our percentage share increased over the last 12 months in the price environment that you saw. We feel good about it, we feel good about our position and our mix of existing customers and the opportunity with potential new customers.
Jarren Holder: Thanks. And how do you think about recontracting risks just given that there is increasing competition from other U.S. LPG facilities?
Joe Bob Perkins: The competition we feel the most are the ones who have been there for a while. That competition should sort of become a natural market share around the butane and propane that float through the systems facility further away trying to get propane or butanes from Mont Belvieu. It's not particularly advantage for doing that, so I probably don't worry about that competition this much and we try to be very competitive and pretty discreet on how we're working with our customers and potential customers here in this market.
Jarren Holder: Great. Thank you.
Matthew Meloy: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning, Chris.
Chris Sighinolfi: Hey, Joe Bob. How are you guys doing?
Matthew Meloy: Good. Good morning.
Chris Sighinolfi: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to I guess first circle up on that if I could? It seemed like a slight little decline in volume both on a quarterly basis. I realized what you said in regard to that contract positions on those. So I was just wondering if that decline in volume was in that area, was it due to something specific? Or was it just a function of reduced fuel volumes falling that way?
Joe Bob Perkins: That's a combination of all those things. It's a reduced volume that's flowing in from our volumes and others but there were some contract roll off late in 2015 which when you look, I kind of see in sequential quarter-to-quarter, we'll see some difference from Q4 to Q1 happen in the fourth quarter.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. And your earlier point was from here, there's very limited contract change over the next three years?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, that's right.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. And then with regard to - I really appreciate the color in the prepared remarks or timeline for in service. I think you have mentioned, or Joe Bob mentioned that you're expecting now a slightly lower ramp on that facility than original expectations. Could you remind us how much of that facility is contracted?
Joe Bob Perkins: It's largely for our own needs and we haven't described how much it would be for third parties. Into some extent, I recognized that it's not one train at a time even though we can contract it that way. We had volumes in Louisiana that needed to be at Mount Belleview, not in Louisiana that will be back in train 5 for example. I think that's all of the specifics we provided. But we've got them some space at Train5 if anyone is interested in contacting at the right term.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. I guess the final question for me, Joe Bob, you have addressed the volumes with CP Chem and I know you spoke to TJ about it in the Q&A, and I get that you're not actively pursuing any expansion in that line of business right now. Maybe this is just a question born from my own ignorance, but what would have to happen to get you to move forward with something? I guess what I'm going is that there is a view out there that - as an LPG facility because that's what you've been doing there. But to the extent that perhaps there would become some under-utilized capacity that you might be able to repurpose to an alternate use. How do I think about that decision tree?
Joe Bob Perkins: Well, I would say that first of all look at our history over multiple year with that facility. When we acquired it, we thought of Galena Park as an import facility doing a little bit of export of ethylene. We're economic animals and we will try to respond to the needs of the market. Ethylene is an interesting equation, gotten a lot smarter over it recently trying to answer people's questions and that will be driven by the PC Chem customers linked in that ethylene market in this area and how long that's likely to continue. Are we purposing our facilities? It's really a way to describe it because we would not have to cannibalize any of our existing facilities. We've got ways of getting a little bit more out of this, that and the other piece of equipment, and if we need one or two increase ethylene, would do so without repurposing. We could move more ethylene from that dock for example. We might add some refrigeration for ethylene so that it didn't get in the way of propane or butane loading. Before we would repurpose anything, we want to make an additive.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay.
Joe Bob Perkins: That's not saying I'm doing a project, didn't mean to imply that, but if CPC has a need, we're going to try to fill it and if another counter-party believes that we can effectively service our ethylene needs, we may do that.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. So all you're saying before is there is nothing active right now, but there is no active opposition to anything should there be a market need?
Joe Bob Perkins: Sometimes when I'm working on prepared remarks, I can be unclear. I was not trying to say opposition, I was just trying to get the facts out there for people.
Chris Sighinolfi: Right. And the clarification is helpful because I didn't know if it was, okay, we're going to do this and that's going to make it less possible to do what has been the core function of that facility. It seems like from what you've just said, you can readily do both?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay, got it. Well, thanks for that clarity. I appreciate the time and good luck.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Edwards from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hey, John.
John Edwards: Yes, good morning, everybody. Just a couple house-keeping items. Maybe you've said this or I missed it, any change or what's the EBITDA guidance now and then what's the sensitivity now to commodity price changes?
Matthew Meloy: The commodity price changes, we'll have that in our updated investor presentation, but I actually don't think it was changed from our last. I think it's a five - we the $0.05 NGL move, I think is about $25 million of EBITDA, but it will be in our investor presentation like for crude gas and NGLs.
Joe Bob Perkins: And we did update it.
Matthew Meloy: Yes, and we did update it. And then for EBITDA guidance, we have not provided or updated 2016 EBITDA guidance other than what was - just previous EBITDA numbers that are out there, forecast information that's out there. So we have not provided new EBITDA guidance on its own.
John Edwards: Okay, no new guidance on that. And then I was just curious. Maybe it's just a timing issue, but your maintenance capital drop quite a bit sequentially. Is that just the timing issue? I guess with the 110, you're guiding to - we should be thinking about significantly higher numbers - as it's going to spread pretty much equally across the quarters, or is there already seasonality embedded in that?
Matthew Meloy: The maintenance CapEx - as you go back and look, it could be pretty lumpy. Q1 does seem to be a bit lower than the other quarters and you look last year it was relatively, I think, low, too. I think 110 for the year is still a pretty good number. Could we come in a little bit lower? Sure, but I think it's still probably a decent number.
John Edwards: Okay. Is that going to be relatively equally balanced though for the rest of the year, do you think?
Matthew Meloy: We usually spend more in Q4, but it will just depend on that activity as well.
John Edwards: Okay, that's it for me. Thanks.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from Sunil Sibal from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.
Sunil Sibal: Yes, hi. Good morning, guys and congratulations from a good quarter. Couple of questions for me. Going back to your prepared comments regarding balance sheet, remaining a top priority of management team. Clearly, you made a lot of progress there and I was just wondering with the $2.1 billion of liquidity that you have, how should we be thinking about next liquidity.
Joe Bob Perkins: I think I got that. We want to have a lot of liquidity in this environment, in an uncertain environment. Whether or not the capital markets with a high-yield markets are open and shut, in the last six months I've got pretty much close and now they're pretty open. So we want to operate with a lot of liquidity. We don't necessarily think of that liquidity as a just usage to go out and buy things necessarily with it. We are focused on keeping liquidity and were also focused on a leverage ratio. So we want to keep our leverage ratio as strong as possible in this environment. So I view having that liquidity as providing additional flexibilities for CapEx and timing of when we raise additional capital but also for refinancing and taking care of our other debt obligations.
Sunil Sibal: Okay, that's helpful. And then just one housekeeping for me. It seems like your past G&A has been understandably quite in the last couple of quarters. How should we be thinking of that now that on a go forward basis?
Matthew Meloy: Yes, the G&A has moved around a little bit over the last couple of quarters. Fourth quarter of last year it was kind of a catch-up for the remainder of the year relatively low. This quarter's DNA is a better kind of indication of closer to a run rate number so I would focus more on the Q1 kind of G&A number than it would look at necessarily a fourth quarter.
Sunil Sibal: Okay, got it. That's good. Thanks guys.
Matthew Meloy: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill McKenzie [ph] from Seaport Global. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys, thanks. What are your competitors reported kind of attractive levels of LPG export volumes going to Asia. I know with your mix of Latin America South American gradient is a decent amount of seasonality. Are you seeing within that pretty percent other part of the world enough incremental volumes driven - given the shipping prices right now to offset some of the seasonality.
Joe Bob Perkins: There is some all use the term seasonality broadly. Not every month is the same. Based on our short history of exports so I understand what you are saying. With our published LTM will show that it is 75% Latin America Caribbean and South America for Targa now. We believe that there is sufficient business for that 75%. That's why a quarter inch year attractively. And the 25% is also attractive. I mean people are looking at this over the long term and I just over the short term. That 75% share I'm reminded has been sued benefit from the Panama Canal which the sooner decide closer and closer you get to their best estimate of when it's supposed to be complete the less they will be wrong about it. But it will soon be open. And it will make a difference or at least some of our customers believe it will make a difference. We like our position to that market. And we like the mix.
Unidentified Analyst: So if your nameplate Desha looking at the Q4 presentations on the website. 9 million barrels a month excuse me in operating 6.5 to 7. At what point given that the rest of the world given some long-term contracting do you have to evaluate the potential expansion.
Matthew Meloy: I know by saying this I'm going to be asked more and more for details the numbers on it but I'm not going to give them. We have improved our ability to operate that facility since we last put numbers out with creative and operationally experienced solutions to the bottleneck. Second ago we talked about the ability to continue to utilize our facilities without having to make choices about repurpose and something. And we will keep doing that. If there is additional demand for our assets we are to figure out how to squeeze more out of our assets. When I say we should take me out of the equation. It's a bunch of talented engineers and operations folks. But I'm proud of that and I know that we will continue to get benefits from that kind of work.
Unidentified Analyst: So you're basically, talking about squeezing instead of 75% of operating capacity on nameplate something in the 80s or better for less turnarounds or more efficient turnarounds or whatever, getting closer to that time?
Matthew Meloy: Those are examples of it. We also said we could do an ethylene project without really cannibalizing will be party doing or do in the future. We've got an ethane project that we could add to the facility without cannibalizing or reducing what we think we could do in the future on propane and butane's. So it's a very good facility and we try to think about the future for it.
Unidentified Analyst: All right. And then the fascination volumes, I know another better talk about decline had been at least for them have been impacted by planning opportunities. I assume you guys have seen the same thing. At what point the commodity price spectrum that this opportunities return to market.
Joe Bob Perkins: I think I know what you are referring to. Part of the margin was impacted by planning opportunities because you have less volume a different planning opportunities coming off the frac's. Less planning opportunities hit us to but it doesn't impact the front and volume going through the frac, just the profitability coming out of the frac.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vein [ph] from BMO Capital. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. Most of my questions have been hit. I have one quick one. Joe Bob, you mentioned that you definitely see constructive ethylene fundamentals and that you guys are modeling that internally. Can you quantify the potential impact, positive impact, that you see from ethane reinjection to the gas stream?
Joe Bob Perkins: Our modeling has quantified that impact under multiple scenarios and I'm not going to provide a public a number of that plus I just don't know what the right inputs are at this point.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. That's it for me. Thanks.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Helen Ryoo from Barclays. Your line is now open.
Helen Ryoo: Good morning. Just a follow-up on the ethane recovery in missionary where we have to recover all the ethane given the tractor demand, trying to look - think about the upside to Targa, obviously the NGL the POP margins going to better but on your frac plans, the surplus capacity that exists today is that all economic upside if you were to fill all that capacity or are you currently collecting some NBC volumes on capacity that's not being -
Joe Bob Perkins: We think that is pretty much upside, there may be some small NBC makeups but I think it would pretty much be upside to our volumes if we were to start recovering more and having more ethane going through our fractionators.
Helen Ryoo: And what about on the marketing side of the NGL downstream business, if NGL pricing shoots up driven solely by ethane does the marketing segment also benefit or is that more driven by propane and butane prices?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, there will be some benefit there as well. There will be some there as well.
Helen Ryoo: Okay. And then just lastly, your NGL production dropped a deeply and I was wonder if there was a one-time affect or if it reflects some changes in the wetness of gas there?
Matthew Meloy: We go in and out of recovery of those facilities based on economic benefit and some of our contractual requirements downstream in the facility. So you will see variation in those volumes throughout different quarters because of the contractual structure that we have at those facilities.
Helen Ryoo: Okay. So it is not something sort of a permanent level we will see going forward?
Matthew Meloy: No, nothing has changed as far as the gas quality coming into the plants. It will - the way the contracts work it will be intermittent. It won't be throughout the quarters. We will have periods will we will have higher recovery that during other periods.
Helen Ryoo: Got it. All right, thank you very much.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you, operator. If anyone has follow-up questions, please feel free to contact Chris, Jen, Matt or any of us. We appreciate your interest this Friday.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. And have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Targa Resources Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce you host for today's conference, Ms. Jennifer Kneale. Ma'am, you may begin.
Jennifer Kneale: Thank you, Laura. I'd like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and full year 2015 investor call for both Targa Resources Corp and Targa Resources Partners LP. Before we get started I’d like to mention that Targa Resources Corp., TRC or the company and Targa Resources Partners LP, Targa Resources Partners or the partnership have published the joint earnings release which is available on our website at www.targaresources.com. We’ll also be posting an investor presentation on the website later today. I’d also like to remind you that on February 17, Targa Resources Corp posted its acquisition of all the outstanding public units not already owned by TRC of Targa Resources Partners LP. Any statements made during this call that might include the company's or the partnership's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor Provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Please note that actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings, including the partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Joe Bob Perkins, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Meloy, Chief Financial Officer will be our speakers today. And other members of the management team are available to assist in the Q&A session if needed. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Jen. Welcome and thanks to everyone for participating. Before we turn to the Targa’s results, I’d like to briefly discuss the closing of our buy-in transaction and also discuss our recently announced $500 million preferred private placement. Targa’s management team and our Boards of Directors are very pleased that we closed TRC’s acquisition of outstanding common units of TRP on February 17. From our perspective the simplification of Targa’s ownership structure may have been one of the most important transactions in Targa’s history and I want to thank our shareholders and common unit holders for their strong support of the transaction. But overwhelming the positive results of our shareholder and common unit holder votes reflect investor understanding that this was the right move for Targa. Targa is now better positioned from a leverage credit profile and dividend coverage perspective and that positioning creates financial flexibility as exceedingly important in uncertain markets. Looking forward we recognize that there are continued investor concerns around every company in the energy industry related to risk associated with capital markets access, risk from lower prices, risk of lower producer activity levels and volumes, counterparty credit risks and high interest in how each company will manage their balance sheet and dividends. We’ll try to address each of these topics related to Targa in some detail during the call. And we’ll try to provide you with color on our views of our risks, mitigation, how we think about the industry challenges that we face today. Let’s start with our financial flexibility and our financial strength. When we announced that TRC was buying TRP on November 3rd, we provided two illustrative scenarios. The street consensus case and the price sensitivity case showing those cases over a three year forecast period. Additionally, in our public presentations before and after that time, we’ve provided current EBITDA sensitivities for NGOs, natural gas and crude oil price changes. One can use the information previously provided in the price sensitivity case and the EBITDA sensitivities for commodity prices to extrapolate additional scenarios for different price and volume scenarios. And in so doing one of the likely resulting conclusion should be that Targa has financial flexibility across a wide range of potential scenarios. Also Targa is the solid high yield credit and does not have rating agency created constraints relative to maintaining an investment grade rating. And separately, Targa has significant cushion relative to complying with our financial covenants. That cushion, that flexibility has further increased by the preferred private placement that we announced last week. A week ago today, we announced that we had entered into binding commitments with affiliate of Stonepeak infrastructure partners to purchase $500 million of 9.5% series A preferred stock. This is a great transaction for Targa and for our new Stonepeak investment partners. One that we structured knowing that Stonepeak and other investors share a fundamental view that the strength of Targa's asset footprint are operational capabilities and track record of execution are not currently reflected in our current common stock and debt trading levels. From our perspective this structure accomplishes many of the objectives that we have and we announced about six months ago that we would seek alternatives to public common equity funding. The preferred pace in 9.5% dividend and the addition of warrants provides upside to our financial partner and to Targa's common shareholders. This structure mutually benefits Targa and Stonepeak under any recovery commodity price scenario. We stated publicly in a presentation in early September that we were going to find attractive funding sources other than public equity and we patiently work to develop an attractive addition to Targa's capital structure. With this preferred equity we are not trying to solve for any one specific variable or achieve any one specific metric instead consistent with what’s been going at Targa over the last year and a half and throughout the history of Targa and we identify a capital market opportunity or some other opportunity to do something to strengthen Targa for the future we have. In this case we indentified an opportunity to meaningfully improve our balance sheet and capital structure flexibility at very attractive terms. I think this is another example of our forward-looking mindset, similar to our small retailer preferred in October and our high yield offering in September. This is consistent with how we have always approached the business and will continue to do so in the future. We know there are significant uncertainty in the market, but one thing is certain Targa is blessed with tremendous workforce and a well positioned asset set, well positioned capabilities we will continue to identify opportunities to improve our balance sheet, maximize our financial flexibility and enhance our operational and commercial performance so that we are positioned to create a long term shareholder value regardless of the environment. We are also very excited to have Stonepeak as an important financial partner of ours. And we welcome Scott Hobbs as an observatory contributor to our board. Scott is a 35 year energy industry veteran and is well known by the Targa team. We expect to use the proceeds from the $500 million of preferred to reduce indebtedness which on the pro forma basis importantly reduces TRP’s year end compliance leverage ratio to 3.6x debt to EBITDA and we have approximately $2.2 billion of liquidity. I would like to pause here for a minute and discuss our leverage position as we see it, so that we can clear up any misperceptions that might be out there. Pro forma for the buy-in, the only real change to our capital structure is that we no longer have publicly traded units of NGLS. Our basic corporate structure remains the same in the placement of the debt. At TRC we have about $670 million of revolver, about a $160 million of term loan deal. At TRP we’ve a $1.6 billion revolver, a $225 million accounts receivable facility and publicly traded notes. There is a compliance covenant of 5.5x at TRP, but there is no other meaningful covenant or constraints on TRP leverage, TRC leverage or consolidated leverage. Pro forma for the $500 million preferred TRP compliance leverage is 3.6x versus that 5.5x compliance covenant. My simple math that means to me we have almost two turns of cushions. And with our long term often repeated target range for compliance leverage having been 3x to 4x we believe that Targa is currently in a very strong balance sheet position from a Targa historical perspective and probably relatively to others in the industry. Compliance leverage at the partnership level is the relevant constraint to overall Targa leverage. And we are appropriately comfortable managing Targa leverage at the TRP compliance level. As we move forward in time and peruse attractive growth opportunities managing the resulting consolidated leverage will be one factor for consideration. And any assumption that management won’t be focused on managing leverage is inconsistent with our track record. Just as managing leverage and managing our balance sheet is consistent with the Targa track record, Targa also has a track record for outperforming relative to other controllable factors. We are never satisfied with any set of internal forecast and I can promise you that the decision making associated with our company is fluid and evolving always seeking to outperform our internal forecast and expectations. We will continue to focus on taking the right forward looking steps for Targa, trying to improve on all controllable factors or any range of potential commodity price and activity levels. We spend each day focused on long term value creation that is our track record and that is our mindset. So in the phase of uncertain prices, uncertain activity levels and related uncertain volumes perhaps may even more uncertain by oil prices breaking $30 several times over the last month and a half, you will now be hearing a new Targa 2016 forecast, but what I hope you hear from me is confidence. Confidence that we have already taken significant steps to position Targa for success and a lower for longer environment and confidence that we will continue to identify ways to best position Targa for the future. Summarizing the reasons for that confidence, in the context of the uncertainties that I just mentioned strong 2015 results and strong business performance driven by an exceptional workforce and a premier asset footprint. Solid year end leverage and coverage we finished 2015 strong on multiple dimensions, substantial liquidity and impressive results in managing costs and improving margins. Over the long term we know that with our premier asset position we are well positioned to benefit from the upside potential of some of the following factors. NGL pricing improvements, ethane and other components and other commodity price improvements, increased ethane extraction, additional cost savings and continuous improvement in that area, increased exports, capture of new gathering and processing and capture a new downstream volumes. Continued contract restructuring to Targa's benefit and yet to be identified opportunities for high return capital projects. Let’s now turn to discussing Targa’s performance in 2015. Despite significant commodity price headwinds throughout the year, 2015 adjusted EBITDA was $1 billion $191 million. A 23% increase versus 2014. I want t o pause on that EBITDA number for a moment and provide some additional context. At the beginning of 2015 we developed and our board approved a formal plan in January of last year using the best information we had at the time for the expected performance of Targa and including the expected impact from the addition of the assets acquired in our mergers with Atlas. Looking back at actual prices in 2015 compared to the estimated commodity prices assumptions that we used for our 2015 board approved plan, our adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by about $130 million based on price alone. Meaning we were about a $130 million in the whole to solely for price variance. But our final adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion $191 million beat the 2015 board approved plan by about $25 million, the biggest compensating drivers for VAT mitigation, we reduced OpEx across the asset footprint, improved contract margins, lower G&A and better than expected downstream LPG export and storage performance. I am incredibly proud of the collaborative work of our employees to identify best practices related to OpEx maintenance capital and contracts and then applying and continuing to apply those best practices across all areas of our operations. I am also incredibly proud of the focus of our employees to deliver savings and operational results without sacrificing safety or environmental compliance and without saving today at the expense of tomorrow. Very important work in focus continues in 2016 and we expect continuous improvement in these areas. Our 2015 results provided for a year-over-year dividend increase of 24% at TRC and modest distribution growth of 5% at TRP as we held TRP distributions flat in the second, third and fourth quarters in response to the industry cycle. Pro forma for the completion of TRC acquisition of TRP under the price sensitivity scenario presented at announcement on November 3, then published again on December 3, we showed an estimated dividend growth of 10% of TRC in 2016 versus 2015. If we compare today's environment to that price sensitivity scenario presented less than four months ago, strip prices are significantly lower, producer volume forecast are lower and even more uncertain and equity and debt market volatility and pressures have increased. So what does that mean for Targa? Means that we will continue to make decisions the way we have throughout our history thoughtfully, prudently and patiently. We have taken steps to provide Targa with cushion which means we have time to continue to monitor markets, and to continue our dialogues with investors related to appropriate dividend strategy for Targa in this environment and across the cycle. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we elected to maintain our quarterly dividend of $0.91 per common share. Growing our quarterly dividend in the face of uncertainty didn't make sense to us or our board. Similarly, making a rash decision to meaningfully change our quarterly dividend didn't feel appropriate to us or board. We have many levers available to us as we think about our ability to execute in 2016 at market remains challenged, levers such as continued cost savings from OpEx, CapEx and G&A reductions. Pursuing identified opportunities to enhance EBITDA to improve volumes, contracts, high return in capital projects etcetera. Pursuing not yet identified opportunities to enhance EBITDA through similar cost savings or commercial actions. Consideration of assets sales or asset level joint ventures was strategic or financial partners and of course selected private equity placements or financing as demonstrated by the Stonepeak transaction. We are already pulling some of those levers. As evidenced by our results and actions in 2015 and early 2016. Other levers and actions along with future dividend policy will continue to be thoughtfully considered over time. So, that concludes my perhaps too long introductory remarks. Thank you for your patience and we hope that the remarks help reinforce how we were thinking about managing target in the current environment. I'll now turn the call over to Matt.
Matthew Meloy: Thanks, Joe Bob. I'd like to add my welcome and thank you for joining our call today. Before we cover Q4 results, I just want to make sure there's nothing fusion about the goodwill issue mentioned in our press release from February 9. As discussed in that release and quantified today, the partnership identified the material weakness in the control related to its review of the purchase accounting calculations used to estimate the preliminary fair value. As of the accusation date of the assets and liabilities acquired in the ATLS Merger. Goodwill at the merger date has been restated and we subsequently recognize a non-cash provisional loss of $290 million associated with the impairment of goodwill in our Field G&P segment. This loss was non-cash and does not affect EBITDA. Now, turning our attentions to Q4, other Q4 results. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was 325 million, compared to 258 million for the same time period last year. The increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of TPL. Overall, operating margin increased 14% for the fourth quarter, compared to last year. And I will review the drivers of this performance in our segment review. Net maintenance capital expenditures were 25 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to 24 million in 2014 bringing full-year 2015 maintenance CapEx to 98 million. And for 2016, we expect approximately a 110 million of maintenance CapEx. Turning to the segment level of summarized fourth quarter's performance on a year-over-year based is starting with our downstream business. Fourth quarter 2015 logistics and marketing operating margin was 15% lower than the same quarter last year driven a lower fractionation in LPG export margin. LPG export margins were down 15% from the fourth quarter of 2014, when we benefitted from record volumes. On our third quarter earnings call, we mentioned that we saw, we could continue to benefit from increased ship availability, growing waterborne LPG market, and globally competitive [indiscernible] prices with propane and butane which we expected to result in fourth quarter volumes being similar to the prior quarter. However, we exceeded those expectations in the fourth quarter of 2015 and exported 5.9 million barrels per month, an increase of 4% versus the third quarter of 2015. The first quarter has been strong today, but there is variability across quarters, some seasonality, and we believe that 5 million barrels per month of LPG exports is a good estimate for 2016. Fourth quarter fractionation volumes decreased 12% from the fourth quarter of 2014, driven by lower volumes as a result of cold weather impact on producer and processing plant operation, as well as some lower customer volume and small amount of contract roll out. We have received questions over the last several months related to frac contract expiration. So, want to provide some additional color. Over the next three years, less than 5% of Targa's frac contract expire in less than 10% over the next five years. Turning now to the Field Gathering and Processing segment. Our fourth quarter 2015 operating margin was up 64% versus the fourth quarter of 2014, driven by the inclusion of TPL, which more than offset the decline in commodity pricing. Fourth quarter 2015, natural gas plant inlet for the Field Gathering and Processing segment was 2.6 billion cubic feet per day. The overall increase in natural gas in that volume was due to the inclusion of TPL volume in West Texas, South Texas, South Oak and West Oak, and increases in volumes at SAOU, the Badlands, and Versado. At Sand Hills, volumes were essentially flat, given the system is basically full and we continue to move volume from Sand Hills to SAOU on the Midland County pipeline. Volumes declined in North Texas as a result of reduced producer activity. In the Badlands, crude oil gathered decrease to a 109,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter, a 6% decrease versus same time period last year, primarily as a result of several produce for customers, shutting in existing production to frac new wells late in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the segment, commodity prices were 45% lower, natural gas prices were 44% lower, and NGL prices were 43% lower, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. In the Coastal Gathering and Processing segment, operating margin decreased 24% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Now, let's move on to discuss liquidity, capital structure and hedging. Pro forma for the 500 million preferred equity private placement with Stonepeak, Targa has liquidity of approximately 2.2 billion. As Joe Bob mentioned, this means that on a debt compliance basis, which provides us adjusted EBITDA credit for material growth project that are in process but not yet complete and makes other adjustments. Our pro forma leverage at the end of 2015 was 3.6 times that to EBITDA, versus a compliance covenant of 5.5. Our fee based operating margins was 76% in the fourth quarter of 2015, and we had 74% of margins and fee-based operations for the full-year 2015. For 2016, we estimate more than 70% of fee-based operating margins. For the non-fee based operating margins, relative to our current equity volumes from Field Gathering and Processing, we estimate that we have had approximately 40% of 2016 and 20% 2017 for natural gas volumes, approximately 40% for 2016 and 20% for 2017 of common state volume and approximately 20% of 2016 and 10% of 2017 NGL volumes. We have continued to look at opportunities to add hedges and expect to add some hedges over time through a combination of swaps in cashless collars. Moving to capital spending, in our January investor presentation, we published a preliminary estimate of 525 million or less of net growth capital expenditures in 2016, with approximately 275 million committed to four major projects. CBF Train 5, the Noble Group, and condensate splitter, the Buffalo plant in West Texas, and the joint venture with Sanchez and South Texas. All four major projects will contribute to cash flow in 2016. We have another 250 million of previously identified projects and expect to spend at least a 175 million of this amount. A larger part of that capital is expected to be spend in the Badlands where we will continue to build out our infrastructure and where as you have heard from us many times before, we have been delayed by right away on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. The Badlands growth capital will add infrastructure to net producing gas and oil to our system. Natural gas volumes being flared and crude oil volumes being trucked. These projects result in immediate additional cash flow and have a quick payback. Similarly, any additional capital spend in this category will generally only be spend if the returns are significantly in excess of our funding cost and we'll likely generate near term cash flow. Next, I'll make a few brief remarks about the result of Targa Resources Corp. January 19, TRC declared fourth quarter cash dividend at $0.91 per common share at $3.64 per common share on the annualized basis, representing in approximately 17% increase over the annualized rate pay with respect to the fourth quarter of 2014. TRC standalone distributable cash flow for the fourth quarter 2015 was 55 million and dividends acquired were 52 million. For the full-year 2015, TRC standalone distributable cash flow was 214 million compared to a 125 million in 2014. As of January 31st, TRC had 452 million in borrowings outstanding under a 670 million senior secured credit facility and 15 million in cash resulting in total liquidity of 233 million. The balance on TRC's term loan fee was a 160 million. I want to provide some additional information related to the tax attributes of TRC's acquisition of TRP. Based on TRP's equity value and total debt on the date of the acquisition closed, we estimated a starting tax basis of approximately 7 billion. Some of that will be depreciated on a 15-year straight line basis, and some on a more accelerated basis. The net reduction in tax full income means, we do not expect to be a cash tax payer for at least five years. I also want to briefly cover some of the details related to our preferred plus one structure as published in an 8-k on Wednesday. We announced at Stonepeak because it's agreements to invest 500 million at closing which is expected in mid-March. Quickly running over the structure. Stonepeak will receive 500,000 shares of newly created series of 9.5% preferred stock that will pay quarterly dividend. At our option, Targa may pay quarterly dividend in additional preferred shares and warrants during the first two years after closing, a two year pick option. Additionally, Stonepeak will receive approximately 7 million warrants with a strike price based on the view of the 10 day trading, of the 10 trading days prior to announcement or $18.88. Stonepeak will also receive a second tranche of warrants of approximately 3.4 million warrants with a strike price based on a 33% premium to the [indiscernible] of the 10 trading days prior to announcement, or $25.11. The warrants are detachable but cannot be exercised for six months after closing. The warrants will also net settle as Targa's option for either cash or shares. After the fifth year, Targa can redeem the preferred shares for cash at 110 and after the sixth year and beyond at 105. If the preferred shares have not been redeemed after 12 years, Stonepeak can convert into common shares and Targa can also convert the preferred into common stock under certain conditions. From Targa's perspective, our base case assumptions that we were redeemed the preferred share between year six and year 12, which is another one of the attractive elements of this structure as we believe that is a significant period of time to redeem at a lower all in cost of capital. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Matt. Okay. I'm never going to live that down. That was my phone that rang just a second ago, after often being the one who reminds people to have their phones off. Taking a step towards your asked questions, one of the most consistent questions that we've got from analysts and investor is related to counter party credit exposure. From my early days, is a start-up midstream company, we've always taken our counter party credit exposure very seriously. And always focused on understanding and managing the implications of each contract, going both directions to a significant extent we benefit from a highly diversified portfolio of customer positions across our multiple businesses and across our multiple geographic areas. Our forecasting process takes into account the financial position of our counter parties and we try to appropriately risk volumes and margins as their situation changes. We also monitor and manage our customer exposures on a customer-by-customer in contract-by-contract basis and we always have. And in this environment, those normal processes are on high alert. We try to not publicly discuss specific customers or customer contracts, but believe we are well positioned to manage through risk associated with potential counter party default or bankruptcy and will continue to stress our forecast with full consideration to credit risk and lower commodity price environments. Just as we constantly try to assess the volume implications of those price scenarios. I understand your concern and I believe that the best way to summarize our current situation is to state that separate from the volume and activity level when certainties that we've already talked about, we do not currently believe that Targa has any significant unmitigated producer contract exposures, nor do we have any significant unmitigated fractionation contract exposures that we should highlight to our investors. We understand the concerns and the interest in the questions related to counter party exposure and hope that that simple statement helps alleviate your Targa specific concerns. On our third quarter earnings preliminary color, on our expectations for Field Gathering and Processing volumes, in 2016 versus 2015. As prices have moved significantly lower since then, I think the easiest way to summarize our view of Field G&P volumes today is to say that producer activity level uncertainties are even greater now. And that our expectations for 2016 versus 2015 have been tempered. We previously said that for 2016, we expected our overall Field G&P volume growth to be flat to single digits versus 2015. In today's environment, I still believe that overall Field G&P volumes will be positive for 2016 versus 2015. But the uncertainties associated with 2016 volumes are significant and could push us to flat or slightly negative. Providing some additional detail on that summary statement. In the Permian, recent activity has created volume growth around our West Texas system in the Midland basin, and our Versado system in the Central Basin platform and Delaware Basin. To handle the growth in the West Texas system, and to provide some relief to that system, which has been operated well over a capacity for quite a while. The 200 million cubic feet per day Buffalo plants will be in service in the second quarter of 2016. We are forecasting growth, still in 2016 for WestTX due to increased drilling efficiencies, improved well results despite the current commodity prices and decreasing rig counts. We expect volumes in the Versado's system to be slightly higher in 2016. Driven by activity in the Northern Delaware Basin, and frankly driven by progress to-date even as we look on uncertainties into the future. So, across the Permian, we expect average volumes to increase for 2016 over 2015, but the Permian Basin rig count continues to decrease. And our view of the magnitude of the volume increase is lower relative to our last earnings call. Moving to the mid-continent. We expect volume decline in North Texas, West Oak and South Oak, to a greater extent than on our November call. Still, to some extent, price appreciation from today's level could result in SCOOP volumes in South Oak, surprising to the upside. In the Badlands, we expect natural gas volumes to increase for 2016 versus 2015 even at the current prices. And for crude to be at similar levels, 2016 versus 2015. Both due to some continuing producer activity, and as Matt mentioned earlier, continued infrastructure buildout to capture volumes from wells already producing on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. In October 2015, we announced the joint venture with Sanchez and that agreement will result in some additional volumes in 2016, going to our Silver Oak facilities. So, in conclusion, across our Field Gathering and Processing system, based on the best information we have today, we believe that the expected volume increases in the Permian, South Texas and the Badlands were likely offset the declines in the mid-continent but not to as great of an extent as we thought in November. Downstream, as we have previously stated for LPG exports, we expect 2016 to average at least 5 million barrels per month of propane and butane exports. We're off to a good start in 2016. And I would like to mention how proud I am of the commercial and operational team that manages a flexible and competitively advantage mix of handy mid-sized and VLCC services, as well as the competitively advantage mix of butane and propane cargoes. That benefits Targa and our customers. I guess, in closing, I want to reiterate that I am incredibly proud of our employees and want to thank them for their efforts in 2015 and 2016. Their focus, dedication, and operational and commercial execution drove strong results in 2015, despite significant headwinds from commodity prices. That focused dedication and execution will continue to translate into results in 2016 and beyond. So, with that, we'll open it up to questions, and I'll turn it back to you operator.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from TJ Schultz from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning, TJ.
TJ Schultz: Good morning.
Matthew Meloy: Good morning.
TJ Schultz: I understand the commentary that you've bought some time to discuss dividend policy going forward. We can extrapolate, there's some headroom on coverage, if we assume flat dividends and you certainly have other levers you can still pull. So, how's your view over the medium term of walls to point where there is a specific dividend coverage level that you see as most appropriate for the business or is there a level of coverage too low that now you just don’t want to operate that and then would push you to change dividend policy. Just anything further you can provide on stability of the current dividend in this commodity environment?
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks for the question, TJ. I would say that us thinking has not changed dramatically, and that we have time to listen to the markets. There are disparate views in the markets. Our equity in our debt are certainly dislocated in the markets. And that we don’t have additional clarity to the extent that your question suggests.
TJ Schultz: Okay, fair enough. You have a lot of levers on the cost side. How much more room is there on this lever in 2016, whether through OpEx or G&A, just trying to gauge how hard you've already pushed this through the fourth quarter result?
Joe Bob Perkins: First of all, I'm very proud of what's been pushed through, good term, in 2015. Smart, well thought out cost reductions, really across our companies, across the multiple businesses, to continue to drive, for example, operating cost reductions, savings on maintenance capital without sacrificing safety or saving dollars that will cost us to spin more dollars later. That continuous performance improvement, for example, root cause analysis are taking the best performance of the top [indiscernible] of those business and rolling it to the other businesses is ongoing. Operations team has stretched targets that they believe they will achieve for 2016 [Audio Gap] continued performance improvement in those areas. We expect continued performance improvement in those areas.
Matthew Meloy: And just to add to that, I agree with Joe Bob in all those front. There are some factors that are going to lead in the opposite direction to higher OpEx, right. The CBF Train 5 coming on Buffalo point. We have some additional facilities coming on. So, if you're looking at in terms of run rate, you're going to have to increase for additional expansion at facilities coming online.
Joe Bob Perkins: And now, I'll go so far as to say, now with those additional operations coming out and they're not insignificant, you may not see increases, right, yes, okay.
TJ Schultz: Okay, got it. Just one more. Joe Bob, in your prepared remarks, you did walk through the potential the benefit from several things to the upside if and when things turn and you also mentioned some of the levers that you have to act on right now. And one of those that was kind of in both buckets was the potential from possible contract restructurings to your benefit. If you can expand on that opportunity where you may be seeing some need to restructure now or the potential to restructure some of the contracts and how some of that impacts EBITDA?
Joe Bob Perkins: Sure. First of all, I'd expand on it by saying that's not really new for Targa. And we sometimes get questions because of companies that are sort of going from zero to 180 on a portfolio change. Ours is more like one contract at a time across our businesses and we see that as influential in today's environment. It's been part of the improvements we had in 2015 and we expect it to be part of the improvements we have in 2016. It insures that individual projects achieve an attractive return or they're not done for example. And it is on every commercial person's right on scope, but they don’t have any EBITDA estimate for you. It will be one of the mitigating factors and part of the results that we deliver.
TJ Schultz: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Darren Horowitz from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Darren Horowitz: Joe Bob, I've got a G&P question for you. You had mentioned the 30% or less forecast of 2016 margin, that obviously has a little bit more POP contract exposure. And I understand the commodity price sensitivities that you previously detailed. If we were to back out the benefit of the fee-based projects that you guys have coming to service over the course of this year. And just look at the base business. Where do you want that fee-based profile to be exiting this year? And as you look to next year, upon some of those contract restructuring opportunities, how do you balance that fee-based component of cash flow versus the ability to participate in what you said a price upside potential scenario should it occur?
Joe Bob Perkins: I think the short answer to your question is that all of our investor would like to see that fee-based component go down, because commodity prices went up. But what we don’t have is a magic dial of saying where do we want it to be. We're managing at in the context of the opportunities that have been presented to us over a multiyear of path. The balancing is sort of one opportunity at a time, not a magic formula that we can change from quarter-to-quarter.
Darren Horowitz: Okay. And then my last question. Just with regard to counterparty risk. In near terms you said that you don’t have significant unmitigated contract exposure. And I'm just wondering if you could quantify the threshold either in EBITDA o revenue terms that is co-significant by your definition?
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay. First of all, the traditional measure of counter parties on revenue terms is not terribly useful. We can provide those rankings, but it doesn't help when you think about EBITDA exposure, which is what we're trying to manage and you are interested in. Way I characterized it was reviewing it with our commercial leadership in our credit committee, one contract at a time, I don’t see a significant one, meaning hitting the radar scope of a discussion with our investors as being out there and unmitigated. I understand other companies and the issues that are being discussed and published, we don’t have anything that comes close to those levels. So, I'm not giving you a magic number. I'm giving you that consistent with what we bring to these earnings calls consistent to what we bring to our investor presentations, which is a level of interest in significance and changes to expectations. There is not anything out there. Okay?
Darren Horowitz: Thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: I should say there is not currently anything out there, because I just looked at it three days ago. Okay. And I know commodity prices are getting worse and that a lot of EMP companies are in trouble. But we don’t have a significant unmitigated position that I would feel should have been brought to this discussion.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brandon Blossman from Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Company. Your line is open.
Brandon Blossman: Good morning, guys.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hi, good morning.
Brandon Blossman: Let me start with something positively easy. What's the objective here as we go through the bottom of the cycle in terms of hedging and leading some exposure to the upside for '16 and '17?
Matthew Meloy: Yes. We have had as it going to track quarter-to-quarter we've added some hedges, but we really have not added much, where we see rally and your relative rally is anyway gas or crude. We may layer on some additional hedges. We're not at this point looking to catch up to make up to our targeted exposures. So, we can find pockets where it may make sense to hedge an NGL component or maybe some additional gas or crude. We'll take a look at that so sort of a significant rally in those commodity prices, I don't see us looking to make up our head position.
Brandon Blossman: That's fair enough and any general estimates down where your mark-to-market on 40% hedge positioned for 2016 you are?
Matthew Meloy: That will be the case that we file you will see full details on the mark for assets and liabilities when we file that.
Joe Bob Perkins: we got a question last call about make that already see road down on a estimate of how, it's positive no surprise it's positive whether we would take that off the table that's unlikely to occur.
Brandon Blossman: Okay fair enough. And then Joe Bob, I appreciate the need to -- here but just purely conceptual not from a defensive perspective needing to reflect the balance sheet or providing amount of cushion at dividend policy on a go forward basis as it relates to where the equity is trading at and what the markets telling you about their expectations of the dividend policy how do you spread that needle between giving cash out when the market doesn't at this point in time appreciate that cash in terms of dividend?
Joe Bob Perkins: I understand your question, I think it's interesting describing threading the needle of what the market, I pulled them with strain, cut your dividend to zero or cut it to x and other people on the call would scream you should say you would never cut your dividend that's not much of a needle that's a giant gap in market perceptions and we hear them both constantly as I am sure other midstream companies are hearing. So we are trying to listen to the market, the market on the margin right now the market on the margins is irrational about Targa's equity pricing in my opinion and with cushion we have time to see how things are sorting out without making rash moves I think that's a luxury, I am not trying to parse words I am trying to tell you exactly how I am thinking about it.
Brandon Blossman: Okay understood and actually appreciate that color Joe Bob that's all from me.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.
Sunil Sibal: Hi good morning guys and congrats on nearly a strong quarter.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks good morning.
Sunil Sibal: Couple of questions from me, first off starting off with some of the areas which I mentioned seeing lot of weakness in terms of producer activity, I was kind of curious if you have any thoughts about around industry consolidation in some of those areas any opportunities you see either way?
Joe Bob Perkins: No I ran into a friend of mine at breakfast, why am I answering this way he is from the oil field services industry and talks about this is the time to oil field services industry will shake out and the opportunities will occur before the upturn. Having been through multiple cycles we believe there are opportunities in downturns even without trying to pick the particular time and consolidation is naturally occurring now without even transactions. Volumes are moving to the strong from the weak. You can see on the MP side struggling companies there were ownership will change in the midstream side ownership of assets in companies will change. We have said before that we are mostly looking our round, our strong asset footprint that's the best place for us to look for opportunities. That may just be an opportunity to consolidate a volume from someone who can't service it. It maybe a minor asset acquisition, it maybe a deal with another midstream provider to more efficiently do something those are the kind of opportunities that fall in that bucket you described this consolidation and we will keep an eye out for and part of our financial flexibility, part of the benefit of that financial flexibility is try not to turn down high return opportunities.
Sunil Sibal: Okay that's helpful and then if you could talk a little bit about the Stonepeak transaction, how it kind of came about was that something again you are looking at for some time and how it really going to precipitated?
Matthew Meloy: Yes sure. We have been talking about preferred and looking at about is kind of a tool in our financing toolkit back, it’s the acquisition so that's been years we have been considering whether it makes sense to do a preferred or convertible preferred. As industry conditions worsen over the course of last year as Joe Bob said earlier, I think it was early September we putting our presentation with NGLS common unit price frustrating, we were looking at alternate financing. And that included preferred, convertible preferred, potential asset sales and we executed on retail preferred offering shortly thereafter of $125 million. Really since we said that at the conference in early September we received a number of term sheets whether they are assets level preferred up to the corporate level whether it's TRP or TRC, we had a lot of incoming and a lot of term sheets about potential structures and ideas so we have been working that really pretty hard all through last fall and the transaction with Stonepeak came together relatively quickly over in 2016 period but we have been, this is something we have been working on for months and the structure and exact terms of course change as you are going through the process but this is something general like this we have been working on for quite a period of time.
Sunil Sibal: Okay that's helpful. And then couple of bookkeeping questions from me, in terms of your OpEx, I was wondering if you could provide some sensitivity of that OpEx to gas prices or even NGL prices?
Joe Bob Perkins: When I am talking about OpEx savings, our primary focus has been on the controllable OpEx savings much of operating cost associated with natural gas or in the case of electric power driven facilities, much of that is passed onto our customers. We keep an eye on it, we manage it to the greatest extent we can but all of the cost savings descriptions that I gave earlier in my comments we are not focused on pass through fuel type saves.
Sunil Sibal: Okay got it. And then, lastly how much was the cash interest expense this quarter?
Matthew Meloy: Yes, I think we are getting to, it looks that interest expense line you will see it looks relatively low, if you look through some of the details there we had a $30 million non-cash interest income which was an offset to the interest expense and that was due to change in the redemption value of our JV partnership for the West Oak and West Texas assets they are in a JV partnership and so there were redemption value change flows to interest expense so there is additional $30 million of non-cash interest income in that line.
Sunil Sibal: Okay got it, thanks guys and congrats once again.
Matthew Meloy: Okay thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Chris Sighinolfi: Good morning Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning Chris.
Chris Sighinolfi: Thanks for the added colors. Just a couple bookkeeping questions Matt with the preferred offering you have the option to take those distributions in the first couple of years and I was just curious what we should assume or if you had made a formal assumption in your modeling on what you’re going to do?
Matthew Meloy: No, we have not determined whether we are going to pay in cash or pick, we will determining that in our normal quarterly distribution and I guess now dividend declaration so that will be a decision made by management and the board at that time.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. And then, I apologize from my events on this, but what does the board observer mean, what I mean Scott being added to your board but you have mentioned in the release and then today on the call as an observer and I was just curious what the distinction was, as he is not sitting on a committee that he have a voting position could you just help clarify that?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, I am happy to help clarify that the primary distinction between an observer and other board member as we will operationalize it, is just official ability to vote. We’ve had a board observer in the past at TRC it was a Merrill Lynch private equity a board observer when they joined on the midstream acquisition through interest sold by over thinkers and without mentioning that person's name they did just sit an observer on the board they contributed and brought their experience and industry understanding and that's what we expect Scott to do as well. When you have a board vote he doesn't officially vote and he would not be officially part of creating a quorum to vote and he will not be assigned to our compensation or audit committee, would not qualify to serve on this.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay, thanks a lot. Kind of what I expected but appreciate the clarity. And then Matt, I am sorry if I missed this if you had said it in your prepared remarks, but I think typically you gave a hedge percentage on the products?
Matthew Meloy: Yes that is 40 and 20 for gas and 15% and 10% 2017.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay and do you did you say at what levels.
Matthew Meloy: No that will be in our K when we file.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. And then finally, and I just wanted to quickly go back to Joe Bob so I could understand if I am interpreting what you have said correctly obviously with the roll in the cash savings associated with the roll in and then the preferred offering you have an incredible amount of head room certainly relative to much of your peer group on the compliance leverage covenants, significant amount of current liquidity not a terrible amount in terms of the near term growth CapEx that's you have to do. And then, somewhat schizophrenic market view as to what you should do with your dividend and so am I just to interpret that flexibility is going to be forward you an ability to sort of wait and making major decisions overtime as conditions either improve or do not improve?
Joe Bob Perkins: There was the first part of your statement that was talking about the context I think you nailed it. And I am not trying to put new words in your mouth, I believe that the measured response that's thoughtful response overtime trying to weigh the factors we see today and the factors we will be seeing tomorrow is the right way to interpret what I was saying. And it is a luxury to have that space to not be forced into a rash decision and that's not poking at you, companies that were hanging on or being forced into those rash decisions that's not where target is. We have the luxury of being thoughtful about how we balance sheet strengthen which we have and intend to keep and how we are serving our shareholders over time with dividend policy if you put it.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. Thanks so much for the time this morning, I really appreciate.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks a lot. 
Matthew Meloy: Okay thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Helen Ryoo from Barclays, your line is open.
Helen Ryoo: Thank you, good morning. I have just a couple of questions when you talk about the…
Joe Bob Perkins: Your phone broke up a lot, can you start over.
Helen Ryoo: Sure, sure. Could you hear me better?
Joe Bob Perkins: That's better.
Helen Ryoo: Okay great. Thank you. So yes, on your CapEx comment just to clarify I guess the 175 you referenced does that imply there is about 75 million of sort of wiggle room to reduce your CapEx budget for the year and also on that 175 is mostly [indiscernible] related and what’s the lead time for that the project in that 175 number?
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay let’s start over a bit what Matt pointed to was other projects currently showing at about 250 million and our prediction that we would spend debt lease to 175. First of all, any dollar we spend in that category is an attractive return and almost all will be immediate 2016 cash flow. So as an investor you want dollars being spent there and I just want to make sure that's clear to everybody we are not going to be spending dollars in that category that aren't well spent. And that investors don't want us to spend and we have the luxury in that category of looking and being careful about the dollars we spend. That probably includes the category of unidentified projects if something comes up it will need to be very attractive return compared to the funds that will require to support it and quick cash flow is better than delayed cash flow. What Matt said was the largest piece of projects was from the battle, and then he used that as an example of immediate cash and attractive return and then said that other expenditures in that category would be similar. Does that help?
Helen Ryoo: Yes that does. But just to clarify so 250 is a sum of the four projects that were already identified that will cancel in 2016?
Matthew Meloy: No ma'am, no.
Helen Ryoo: Okay sorry so that's the additional 275 is and 250 is outside of that number?
Matthew Meloy: Right 275 is the four projects, 250 is just coincidence that they are about the same magnitude. 250 is our estimate for a set of identified projects from a few months ago and 175 or more is the estimate of how much of that we will spend in 2016.
Helen Ryoo: Got it. Got it okay that is very helpful. And then the noble project it's not coming online till 2017 but are going to get that cash flowing starting 2016 so are you…
Matthew Meloy: That's not right either. Noble projects expected to come on the first quarter of 2018, but we will get cash flow in 2016 as a function of what has been a couple of renegotiation around the terms of that project or projects. We said from the beginning that we would not be economically disadvantaged by essentially one year auction as noble re-evaluated exactly what they wanted to do and payments in 2016 are a function of that.
Helen Ryoo: Okay that's helpful. Just going back to your comments on counterparty risk just curious I guess you did have a little bit of Quicksilver exposure and it seems like that contract got rejected pretty early in their bankruptcy process just curious how was there anything special about that contract that made vulnerable or should we think a lot of these just transmission type of projects or contracts or typically more vulnerable in that situation if you could provide your view?
Joe Bob Perkins: you mentioned Quicksilver contract -- currently other don't have a problem with that what I can say is what I told you previously there is nothing significant that I need to talk to you about and if that particular contract were included I would still say there is nothing significant I need to talk to you about. That's really the best I can do with that one right now. And I would certainly not characterize any relationship I might have with that company or we are in renegotiation around that contract as being at all typical or having duplicates in line fractionation contract portfolio.
Helen Ryoo: Okay. And then just lastly Joe Bob on your comment about 130 million of negative effect with the commodity downturn after Atlas acquisition is that pre, does that take into account the hedge protection that came with Atlas or is that without that number?
Joe Bob Perkins: Well, first of all it was only looking at performance relative to a single forecast which was the official board approved plan and yes it was after taking into effect hedge.
Helen Ryoo: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jeff Birnbaum from Wunderlich, your line is open
Jeff Birnbaum: Yes, good morning everyone. I got kicked off the call so I apologize if I duplicate any questions, but Matt did you mention if there were any deficiencies payments that you guys received in the quarter and if not were there?
Matthew Meloy: No we didn't give a break out, we typically do receive some deficiency payments on our take or pay contract whether it be fractionation or on the GMP side, we didn't provide that detail. We didn't feel it was significant enough to give that color. So there is some seasonality to our logistics business where we get some of those payments in Q4, but we didn't give detail on that this time.
Jeff Birnbaum: Okay. Thank you and then just on the, back to LPG exports obviously you have, as you commented you seen some good strength the fourth quarter it seems like the first quarter to-date has been strong, I guess just given your comment about five million barrels a month being a good number to use this year relative to those kind of a more recent results. Can you talk a bit about how you see that driven either by seasonality or perhaps the first half relative to the back half and I mean you guys loved talked about this but have you added contracted balance since you last updated the market or not and then is that something you can quantify for us?
Joe Bob Perkins: I love to cross the table and Scott Pryor runs that business smiled at me. You don't have anything long enough to hit me with so I am going to, but he can find me. Our five million barrels per month average for 2016 we believe is a good number for you and we gave that number actually some time ago. We said that 2016 was all to a good start there is some published reports where people look at ships leaving docks and that sort of thing and I guess we are saying yes, those published reports are probably right and our 2016 has gotten off to a strong start. We haven't had a whole lot of annual performance from our docks, it's relatively new business but there is a little bit of seasonal effect, the light first quarters going into second quarter as a function of global seasonal usage of water borne LPG and impacts something on the margin. You can see it in the last year's performance we kind of half way expected and this year’s performance and I think that's why either Matt or I mentioned some seasonality on average for 2016, we expect five million barrels per month I do not expect five million barrels every month. Is that help at all?
Jeff Birnbaum: Yes, Joe Bob thank you, it does help I guess just sort of as we think about sort of the current rate and then sort of once you get pass that seasonality I guess would you I guess the question is, do you expect a normal impact from seasonality or is there something greater this year that is taking it to the I guess what you call the five million barrels a month and accurate, a conservative number or a best guess number perhaps?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, I think you are parsing my statement. I think I said towards end of last year that I don't better about that five million barrels a month estimate then we first put it out there and I feel at least that good. Does that help?
Jeff Birnbaum: It does. Okay thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Eric McCarthy from Citadel, your line is open.
Eric McCarthy: Hi good morning. Thanks.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning.
Eric McCarthy: You touched on ethane recovery in prepared remarks earlier, can you quantify or approximate ethane rejection across the system occurring?
Joe Bob Perkins: How much rejection is occurring?
Eric McCarthy: Yes.
Joe Bob Perkins: I don't have that number for you I would characterize it as there is still significant amount of that thing rejection occurring among gathering and processing facility Targa and others who come into our systems where they can most economically do so you should assume that all participants are making economic decisions every week or every day about what they should reject or recover and that most of those parties are thinking about what some cost they might have in NGLs, when they make those decisions we are on a long way from significant ethane extraction relative.
Eric McCarthy: I guess, your peers talk about how big the opportunity is over the next three years and if I think back to how much ethane out list was rejecting and then compare that to you system or just look if I take the approximately 250,000 barrels a day of NGLs being produced, I would say it's 50% - 75% I think rejection because that's along the order like 50,000 – 60,000 barrels a day they are being rejected?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, not providing a Targa number I have got a question for you when people are quantifying that what price do you think they are using for OpEx?
Eric McCarthy: I would imagine by 2018, 2019 if there is big demand there is going to be some uplift of those residual fuel value right.
Joe Bob Perkins: Well, I think you definitely got to the key, you have to inset the ethane to be extracted and if the ethane is being incentive to be extracted you got to increase in ethane prices ethane won’t go up by itself there will probably be a propane response propane and ethane will probably go together. The potential for that is a combination of volumes for fractionation and volumes and price for other NGLs and you said some upside potential for Targa, but there are a lot of variables to assume to come up what is that dollar potential. And it doesn't make sense for Targa sort of pick one volume and one price and one outcome in 2018 to try to quantify for you right now. I don't think.
Eric McCarthy: Okay. On the build out of that system do you have an approximate number of the current volumes that are being trucked out either on your acreage dedication or nearby?
Joe Bob Perkins: Its 1000 of barrels, okay.
Eric McCarthy: Okay so it's and when you talk about building that system out further is that the opportunity is to capture those volumes currently being trucked or is it to expand to the wells that are scheduled to be completed over the course of the year?
Joe Bob Perkins: What Matt was characterizing relative to capital investment on the band lands. Primarily additional infrastructure on the Indian reservation where we have been working for some time to capture both gas volumes being flared and oil volumes being trucked. And I think what I think you also heard and this is part of the equations is that we still expected gas to be up 2016 versus 2015 in the band lands and that all factors included, well declines we expected oil to be similar 2016 versus 2015 that are current view of activity levels.
Eric McCarthy: Okay alright that's it from me thank you.
Operator: At this time I am showing no further questions I’d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Joe Bob Perkins for closing remarks.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks operator. To the extent anyone has any follow-up questions you are free to contact Jen, Matt or any of us. Thank you again for your time today and your interest and look forward to speaking with you again soon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce you host for today's conference, Ms. Jennifer Kneale. Ma'am, please begin.
Jennifer Kneale: Thank you, Liz. I'd like to welcome everyone to our joint call this morning to discuss the announcement that Targa Resources Corp has executed an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding public units of Targa Resources Partners LP, and to review our third quarter 2015 results for both, Targa Resources Corp. and Targa Resources Partners LP. Targa Resources Crop., TRC or the company and Targa Resources Partners LP, TRP, Targa Resources Partners or the partnership, together Targa, have published the press release and the presentation related to the merger announcement and our joint earnings release and updated quarterly investor presentation on the Events and Presentation section of our website at www.targaresources.com. During the initial prepared remarks of this call, we will be referencing some slides from the investor presentation regarding the merger and you may wish to have it available. I would like to remind you that any statements made during this call that might include the company's or the partnership's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor Provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Please note that actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings, including the partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Joe Bob Perkins, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Meloy, Chief Financial Officer will be our speakers today. And other members of the management team are available to assist in the Q&A session if needed. Joe Bob will first discuss the merger and as mentioned, will reference some pages from our investor slide posted to our website. He will then cover a high level review of third quarter performance and highlights, and will then turn it over to Matt to review the partnership's consolidated financial results, segment results and other financial matters. Matt will also review key financial matters related to Targa Resources Corp. Following Matt's comments, Joe Bob will provide some concluding remarks and then we will take your questions. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe Bob Perkins.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Jen. Welcome and thanks to everyone for joining. I'm proud and excited to have the opportunity to discuss this morning's announcement that Targa Resources Corp. will be acquiring all the outstanding public common units of Targa Resources Partners LP in an all-stock per unit transaction at a ratio of 0.62 TRC common shares per common unit of Targa Resources Partners. As shown on Page 4 of the presentation that Jen mentioned, the TRP unit prices implied by the exchange ratio results in an 18% premium to its volume weighted average price during the ten trading days ended November 2, 2015. And coincidentally, results in an 18% premium over the closing price yesterday. This transaction will be immediately accretive to TRC shareholders. Following completion of this all equity transaction, all of the outstanding common units of TRP will be owned by TRC and will no longer be publicly traded. The incentive distribution rights of TRP will be eliminated. All of TRP's outstanding debt and the new Series A preferred units will remain outstanding and no additional financing is required for the transaction. This is the transformative transaction that provides immediate and long-term benefits for TRC and TRP investors and changes the opportunity profile for Targa across various commodity price environments. Over the last year, this industry and Targa have been faced with challenging commodity prices and significant uncertainty related to future commodity prices, which have driven Targa to assess all our strategic alternatives and to accelerate our thinking on the structure that positions Targa most successfully for the future. In the past, we valued the flexibility and optionality of two public entities, including the possibility that TRC might selectively provide support to TRP through foregoing IDRs, purchasing TRP units or other measures that's mutually beneficial to TRP and TRC. Now we believe that the near-term and long-term benefits of this buy-in transaction outweigh that potential flexibility. With the consolidation, we are a stronger Targa, better positioned for both, lower commodity price environments and for better price recovery commodity price environments. Let me pause for a quick aside about two scenarios used to illustrate that improved positioning. In this presentation and ultimately in the related proxy, you will see two scenarios and ranges of results based on those two scenarios. The base case scenario uses recent research analyst consensus price forecasts and suggest a steady recovery in commodity prices between now and 2018. The second scenario is a sensitivity case based on lower commodity prices which indicates a much lower and less significant price recovery through 2018. For each scenario, we have adjusted the related forecast assumptions regarding CapEx, capital needs and various other factors. The prices in CapEx assumptions are shown in the Appendix of the investor presentation. These two scenarios are indicative of the uncertainty the industry currently faces. And this powerful transaction announced today better positions Targa for these two scenarios, and for pricing environments between and across those two scenarios to the benefit of TRC and TRP investors in a number of important ways. Those ways are summarized on Page 5 of the presentation. First, Targa is better positioned by improving our coverage and credit profile. Pro forma for this transaction; Targa coverage is one greater -- coverages one or greater in both scenarios compared to coverage of less than one on a standalone basis. The improved pro forma coverage creates over $400 million of incremental cash flow coverage over three years in our base scenario and over $600 million of incremental cash flow coverage in the price sensitivity scenario where standalone coverage drop to 0.76. This additional cash flow coverage supports our dividend outlook and reduces our external financing needs. This transaction also creates a simplified one public entity C-Corp structure that should attract a broader universe of investors and allows us to access a deeper pool of capital to finance our future growth. And this transaction improves our cost of capital through the elimination of IDRs, creating a lower cost of equity that improves our competitive position and improves our net returns for expansion and acquisition opportunities. Additionally, the tax attributes of the merger will drive continued low TRC cash taxes, zero taxes for an extended period of time. The result of the strengthened coverage and credit profile, simplified structure, and an improved cost of capital is a stronger long-term growth outlook. A stronger long-term growth outlook for Targa's continued success in a lower for a longer price environment, and in a higher price recovery set of environments. We have tried to illustrate this stronger positioning on Pages 6 through 9 of the Investor Presentation. For the consensus pricing base case, for the pro forma merged Targa, we estimate 15% dividend growth at TRC in 2016 and more than 10% compound annual growth through 2018, as shown on the top of Page 6. Pro forma dividend coverage in this illustrative scenario is 1.13X in 2016 and at least 1.05X in 2017 and 2018, as shown on the bottom of Page 6, up from something like 0.9X in the standalone TRP case. The standalone coverages are shown in the blue bars while the green bar shows the improved coverage pro forma for the transaction, and we'll continue with that color pattern. In the lower commodity price environments we also expect continued pro forma TRC dividend growth as shown on the top of Page 8. Under our price sensitivity scenario, we estimate 10% TRC dividend growth in 2016 and modest growth through 2018. Importantly, even under this scenario, we expect dividend coverage of at least one-time through 2018 as shown on the bottom of Page 8. With that as a quick overview, let's discuss improved coverage, dividend growth and leverage, again in a little more detail. Standalone under the consensus pricing scenario on Page 6, TRP's EBITDA growth is offset by lower hedge settlements, the roll-off of the IDR giveback associated with Atlas mergers and growing interest expense from coverage shortfalls as you all know. As I said the result for TRP standalone would be distribution coverage around 0.9X from 2016 through 2018 assuming flat distribution of $3.30 per common unit on an annualized basis. Under the price sensitivity scenario back on Page 8, where TRP's estimated EBITDA is lower than the previous scenario and DCF is also impacted by the roll-off of the IDR giveback and by growing interest expenses from coverage shortfall at these lower prices, then TRP standalone distribution coverage would decline from an estimated 0.86X in 2016 to 0.76X in 2018, again assuming a flat distribution. Instead, for pro forma new Targa, for the sensitivity price scenario, dividend growth is at least 10% in 2016 with modest growth thereafter. As mentioned, combining TRP and TRC will result in between $400 million and $600 million of incremental cash flow coverages across the two price scenarios, which is significant. These funds protect coverage and could be used to reinvest in our business or to reduce outstanding borrowings. As an equity-only transaction, as mentioned earlier, no additional financing is required and Targa's existing leverage profile will be reduced overtime as a result of the increased retained cash flow. These leverage profile improvements are illustrated on Pages 7 and Page 9 of the Investor Presentation. Looking at the top of Page 7, for the consensus pricing scenario, pro forma compliance leverage is reduced by 0.3X in 2018. Moving to the price sensitivity case, pro forma compliance leverage is reduced by 0.5X in 2018 as shown on Page 9. As mentioned earlier, all of TRP's outstanding debt will remain outstanding and we will retain the same compliance covenants. You will see similar leverage benefits for consolidated leverage on Pages 7 and Pages 9 for the respective price cases. As a result of this deleveraging, our financial flexibility will be enhanced going forward, positioning us to better capitalize on investment opportunities in the market in whatever price environments we find ourselves. I would also add that the new stronger Targa will be managed by the same team with the same thought process regarding our long-term leverage targets of 3X to 4X debt-to-EBITDA and our long-term coverage targets of 1.1X to 1.2X. We will be working to achieve those long-term targets regardless of the ultimate price path that we may encounter in the future. Across our footprint -- that footprint is shown on Page 11. We are continuing to identify and pursue projects with compelling returns, and firmly believe that the new Targa after the buy-in will be best positioned to capitalize on those opportunities to drive higher long-term value to our shareholders, even in uncertain commodity price environment. We have great assets, great people, and a significant opportunity set in front of us. This transaction will enable us to fully execute on those opportunities to the benefit of our stakeholders, regardless to the commodity price environment. And if I may, a brief word to our employees who are hearing about this transaction and the new stronger Targa for the first time this morning, nothing changes about your job or how we will manage the company, except that we will be better positioned for any of the uncertain price environments that we may face. Targa has a bright future and I thank you for your hard work and dedication. So what is next? Our current expectation is that our initial S4 draft will be filed later this month. And we expect TRC shareholder and TRP unit holder meetings and voting approval to occur in the first quarter of 2016 with closing expected shortly thereafter. Now we've obviously got a lot remaining to cover on this call today and probably a significant amount of questions for both the transaction and our third quarter performance, so we are going to shift gears. Targa's reported third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $306 million as compared to $249 million for the third quarter of last year. This 23% increase was driven primarily by the inclusion of TPL operations, which more than offset lower commodity prices. Our distributable cash flow for the quarter of $221 million resulted in distribution coverage of approximately 1.1X. Based on our third quarter declared distribution of $0.825 or $3.30 per common unit on an annualized basis. Operating margin for our Field Gathering and Processing segment was 35% higher than the third quarter of 2014, again driven by the inclusion of TPL which more than offset lower commodity prices. On a sequential basis natural gas inlet volumes and Field G&P were slightly lower in the third quarter versus the second quarter with increases in some areas offset by decreases in others. Based on current activity levels we expect fourth quarter Field G&P volumes to be similar to second and third quarter levels, resulting in approximately 5% growth in 2015 average volumes versus the fourth quarter of 2014 as communicated earlier this year, and we expect 2016 Field G&P volumes to exceed 2015. Moving downstream, the Logistics and Marketing division operating margin was 9% lower versus the third quarter of 2014 driven by lower LPG exports and fractionation margin. LPG export volumes were 11% lower in the third quarter of 2015 versus the same quarter of last year. On a sequential basis, LPG export volumes were 12% higher versus the second quarter of 2015 as a result of the increased demand, likely impacted by greater ship availability. For the fourth quarter, we expect LPG export volumes to exceed 5 million barrels per month, which was our previous guidance. Fraction volumes were 7% lower in the third quarter of 2015 versus the third quarter of 2014. Over three quarters in 2015 fractionation volumes have bounced around, largely a result of volume variability as individual company and plant decisions are made to continue to reject or sometimes recover ethane, economic decisions given daily market prices, plant capabilities and company specific obligations. Targa recently began to recover ethane again at some of our plants given the plant specific economics and we have third-parties that are making similar decisions. Also we had some contracts rolled, but given we are essentially full and the hull is essentially full, those volume changes are really on the margin and are being replaced with Targa's increasing equity volumes from our plants and from additional volumes from new or existing contracts. Across Targa's operations, we are focused on continuing to identify and capture opportunities to reduce operating expenses and capital costs. Best practices in both of these areas are being shared across the company and we believe there are opportunities for continued smart savings moving forward across both G&P and downstream. Smart savings of course means without impacting safety, compliance or necessary preventative maintenance. Our performance in the third quarter highlights the diversity and resiliency of our business mix. There were some pluses and minuses, but overall it was a strong performance quarter in the context of continued weakness in commodity prices. That wraps up my long initial comments, and I'll hand it over to Matt.
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Joe Bob. I'd like to add my welcome and thank you for joining our call today. As Joe Bob mentioned, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $306 million compared to $249 million for the same period last year. The increase was driven by the addition of TPL's operations. Overall, operating margin increased 11% for the third quarter compared to the same time period last year and I will review the drivers of this performance in the segment reviews. Net maintenance capital expenditures were $27 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $22 million in the third quarter of 2014, driven by the inclusion of TPL operations. Turning to the segment level, I'll summarize the third quarter performance on a year-over-year basis beginning with our downstream business. In our Logistics and Marketing division, third quarter operating margin decreased 9% compared to the third quarter of 2014, driven by lower LPG export and fractionation margins offset by partial recognition of the payment received from Noble related to our condensate splitter project and increased terminaling and storage activities. We loaded an average of 5.6 million barrels per month of LPGs for exports compared to 6.3 million barrels per month of LPGs in the third quarter of 2014, resulting in lower operating margin compared to the same time period last year. Fractionation volumes decreased by 7% versus the same time period last year as described by Joe Bob earlier and overall operating margin from fractionation was lower. In our Gathering and Processing division, our Field Gathering and Processing segment operating margin increased by 35% compared to last year, largely driven by the inclusion of TPL. Third quarter 2015 natural gas plant inlet volumes for the Field Gathering and Processing segment were 2.6 billion cubic feet per day. The overall increase in natural gas inlet volumes was due to the inclusion of TPL volumes in West Texas, South Texas, South Oak and West Oak and increases in volumes in SAOU, Versado, Sand Hills and the Badlands. Volumes were lower in North Texas as a result of reduced producer activity. Crude oil gathered increased to 109,000 barrels per day in the third quarter, a 10% increase versus the same time period last year. For the Field Gathering and Processing segment, commodity prices were down across the board, with NGL prices decreasing by 59%, condensate prices decreasing by 53% and natural gas prices decreasing by 35% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Our hedging activities, which mitigate a portion of these price swings, are included in our other operating segment. In our Coastal G&P segment, operating margin was down 59% in the third quarter of 2015 versus the same time period last year, as Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast volumes as well as commodity prices continue to decrease. Let's now move to capital structure, liquidity and other matters. As of September 30, we had $435 million of outstanding borrowings under the Partnership's $1.6 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due 2017. With outstanding letters of credit of $11 million, revolver availability was over $1.1 billion at quarter end. Total liquidity, including approximately $93 million of cash on hand was over $1.2 billion. At quarter end, we had borrowings of $136 million under our accounts receivable securitization facility. In August we reduced the size of the facility from $300 million to $200 million. Year-to-date, we received net proceeds of approximately $500 million from equity issuances, including general partner contributions and $121 million from our recently completed offering of 9% Series A preferred units. On the debt side in early September, we issued $600 million of 6.75% senior notes due 2024 and used the proceeds to pay down our revolver borrowings. We are proud of the execution of our recent transactions in the debt and equity capital markets as we continue to demonstrate access to capital in the current environment. On a debt compliance basis, which provides us adjusted EBITDA credit for material growth projects that are in process but not yet complete, and makes other adjustments, TRP's total compliance leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was approximately 4X debt-to-EBITDA. Next, I'd like to make a few moments about our fee-based margin hedging and capital spending programs for 2015. For the third quarter of 2015, our operating margin was approximately 72% fee-based. We added some hedges using costless collars and swaps during third quarter and since quarter end and for non-fee based operating margin relative to TRP's current estimate of equity volumes from Field Gathering and Processing, we estimate that we have hedged approximately 65% of remaining 2015 natural gas, 55% of remaining 2015 condensate and 20% remaining NGL volumes. For 2016, based on our estimate of our current equity volumes, we estimate that we have hedged approximately 40% natural gas, 40% of condensate and approximately 20% of NGL volumes. Moving onto capital spending, we estimate approximately $700 million to $800 million of growth capital expenditures in 2015, and at this point in the year, we expect to be at the low end of the range. Recently, we provided an expectation of $600 million of growth CapEx in 2016. Next, I'll make a few brief remarks about the results of Targa Resources Corp. Targa Resources Corp. standalone distributable cash flow for the third quarter of 2015 was $54 million and TRC declared approximately $51 million in dividends for the quarter, resulting in dividend coverage of over 1X. On October 20, TRC declared a second quarter cash dividend of $0.91 per common share or $3.64 per common share on an annualized basis. As of September 30, TRC had $445 million of outstanding borrowings and $225 million of availability under TRC's $670 million senior secured credit facility and $160 million outstanding under TRC's senior secured term loan, resulting in a 2.6X compliance leverage ratio. At TRC, we expect a zero to 5% effective cash tax rate for both 2015 and 2016. That concludes my review and I will now turn the call back over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you, Matt. I know that most of the listeners are hoping I'll be brief, but I do have a few more remarks. On October 5, we issued a press release providing you with our preliminary financial outlook for 2016 for TRP and TRC. And in the context of TRC acquiring TRP, we have provided you with a lot of additional details on our outlook for 2016 and beyond this morning. We would like to give you a little more color on the project that we also announced in the early October release as well as our asset outlook for 2016. Also in that October 15 release, we announced the execution of a joint venture agreements -- agreements plural -- with Sanchez Energy to invest approximately $125 million of growth CapEx for a 50% ownership interest in a new 200 million cubic feet per day plant in La Salle County and approximately 45 miles of high pressure gathering pipelines that will connect Sanchez Energy's existing Catarina gathering system to the plant in South Texas. The projects are supported by attractive fee based contracts, volume commitments and acreage dedications. SN has an initial 125 million cubic feet per day minimum volume commitment for the first five years and has dedicated all production from the Catarina Ranch acreage for 15 years. Our outlook for 2016 in both the press release published on October 5, and the merger announcement this morning included the following asset performance assumptions in the consensus pricing scenario. Growth CapEx of approximately $600 million, flat to low single-digit growth in 2016 Field G&P inlet volumes compared to average 2014 inlet volumes and over 5 million barrels per month of LPG export volumes predominantly under contract. As we project our 2016 estimates in the context of industry uncertainties, we believe that our 2016 Field G&P volume growth expectations are reasonable given our year-end volumes and producer activity levels. Some areas will have volume increases likely offset by other areas with volume decreases. A little more color. In the Permian Basin we expect volume increases across our systems. Activity in volume growth around WestTX continues necessitating the completion of the 200 million cubic feet per day Buffalo plant in the first half of 2016. We are also in the process of connecting WestTX and SAOU which will be completed early in 2016, Sand Hills was connected to SAOU in the third quarter of 2014 and we recently completed a Sand Hills connection to WestTX. Producers remain active around Versado and we are benefiting from volumes from the Bone Springs formation in the Delaware Basin to the south-southwest and shallow horizontal Sand Hills activity in the northeast. We have available capacity in Versado and are spending capital on additional pipeline and compression infrastructure expansions with attractive returns. And Sand Hills is effectively full, but we're able to move volumes through to SAOU via the Midland County pipeline and to WestTX with a next connection to increase flexibility across our systems. And increase in volumes for our Permian Basin systems will be partially offset by declines in our Oklahoma and North Texas systems as producers continue to reduce activity levels. There is potential upside in that area for additional SCOOP activity in South Oak. In the Badlands, in the context of lower producer activity impacting the basin, and to a lesser extend impacting our system, our volume profile will be dependent on our producer activity, but also on the pace of progress on the reservation, relative to acquiring ready-to-construct right away as we attempt to build out our infrastructure to capture crude volumes currently being trucked and natural gas volumes being flared from our dedicated acreage. And 2016 volumes will be up in South Texas. As mentioned earlier, we've entered into joint venture agreements with Sanchez. This joint venture is an example of an attractive standalone project for Targa, leveraging our existing asset base, supported by a significant acreage dedication and a long-term fee based contract. Sanchez's results to-date on their acreage are encouraging and volumes are likely to growth well beyond the minimum volume commitment levels given SN's drilling commitments to the Harrison Ranch. Additionally we will benefit from increasing SN volumes in our Silver Oak facilities as Sanchez's existing midstream contracts roll off prior to completion of the La Salle County Plant. So even at high summary, there are obviously a lot of moving pieces heading into 2016 in the gathering and processing area, but we believe that the expected pluses and minuses will result in average 2016 Field G&P volumes being higher than average 2015 volumes. Shifting to downstream, construction on Train 5 continues which should be in service mid-2016. We continue to work closely with Noble on whether to move forward with a new terminal at Patriot, a condensate splitter at Channelview with modified timing or some combination of both projects. We expect clarity on go-forward plans by the end of the year or by the first part of 2016. Relative to LPG exports, some of the same positive factors that impacted Q3 volumes are expected to continue in Q4 and including improved ship availability, Targa competitive advantages relative to our ability to load smaller and medium sized ships, competitive propane pricing relative to world market opportunities and the like. After going back in rereading what I said at the end of the second quarter this year, I think a lot of those messages hold true. We've been operating in an uncertain environment and I am incredibly proud of our execution across the Targa footprint. We cannot control commodity prices, but our day-to-day focus in on safety, meeting customer needs, cost savings and efficiency of capital spending without sacrificing customer service or ignoring low cost options which may benefit Targa in the event of increased activity in the future. Our continued execution across our well positioned diversified asset base has resulted in a relatively strong nine months of performance for Targa, given the commodity price environment. Our future execution across our footprint is dependent on our ability to continue navigating through uncertain environments. That ability to navigate will be significantly enhanced by the merging of TRC and TRP. After much, much time examining the strategic alternatives for Targa, in these multiple price environments and uncertainties, I am convinced that our announced transaction this morning is the best course of action for Targa stakeholders, with stronger positioning and enhanced growth in recovery price scenarios and better positioning and better performance in lower commodity price environments. I want to thank our boards and the TRP Conflicts Committee for their detailed analysis of those same factors and for their approval of this important next step in the Targa story. Operator, I am guessing we probably have a pretty good queue of questions ready to go. So let's open up the line.
Matt Meloy: Okay. And just before we open that up, I just have one last comment. At TRC when I went through the tax rates for TRC, I said we expect a zero to 5% effective cash tax rate for 2015 and 2016 that was in the standalone case or in the previous guidance. Just want to be clear pro forma for the announced buy-in transaction we would expect no taxes at TRC for the foreseeable future. And with that we can open up to questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Lee Cooperman with Omega Advisors. Your line is now open.
Lee Cooperman: Thank you. Thank you. Interesting call. Your first words were basically you were proud and excited about the transaction and I noticed the stock is down 8% TRGP. What do you think people are missing, though you were quite comprehensive in your remarks, but what do you think they are missing in the market reaction? Number one. Number two, is there a breakup fee for either party associated with this transaction? Three, did the advisors that worked through this transaction with you expect this type of market reaction? And those would be my principal questions. But thank you very much for any help you could be.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you. Let me start at the top I think and come back on if I don't address them all. First of all, we have a rule as we're doing these calls that no one looks at the market ticker. We're giving a call based on nine months of performance and we're making a strategic move for Targa for the long-term. So I don't know what the near term market reaction is missing, but I hope that the longer term market reaction is focused on that long-term, that stronger Targa for multiple various price environments and how we will perform better than standalone and that's what we're trying to talk through. The advisors, the Conflicts Committee, and the board were all focused on that. And I think we'll figure out what the market is missing over the next days, weeks and months. There is a breakup fee. It is a sort of normal breakup fee, call it, starts with a C, my favorite word for that, a customary breakup fee, it is less than $100 million and it will appear in the proxy. Did I miss anything? I am looking around the table, okay.
Lee Cooperman: Who pays the $100 million? Who gets the $100 million? Which party?
Joe Bob Perkins: It's reciprocal. And it's not exactly $100 million and it's slightly different. TRC has the ability to extend it over time and you'll see that in the proxy.
Lee Cooperman: That's okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Jeremy Tonet: Good morning.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning, Jeremy.
Matt Meloy: Good morning, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: Congratulations on the strong quarter. I was curious when you were evaluating this transaction, the collapse here versus other strategic combinations, if you could speak to that at all, if that was something that you guys evaluated or had any appetite to do or how this stacks up versus that.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay. I would say that Targa throughout its history has constantly been evaluating strategic alternatives sort of at any point in time across important milestones. And since the Thanksgiving of last year was a significant commodity price drop and figuring out what that new environment might look like and with continued uncertainties that strategic assessment has accelerated. Many strategic alternatives were reviewed really starting at the very first part of the year. Of late and recent weeks and recent months, this one like everybody has written about or even talked to us about, this buy-in transaction has been on the list, when compared to those other alternatives. I really believe that sort of the approval by both boards and the Conflicts Committee indicates that they following management's recommendation believe that this alternative were superior to the others. I hope that answers you question?
Jeremy Tonet: That's very helpful. Thank you. Just a question on taxes, I know you said that you're not expecting to pay taxes for a long time here. But I was just wondering if you could help us think through how you're targeting coverage in the later years as far as that 1.05 coverage versus step up in taxes in the future if you're starting kind of at 0% in the near term, if you could walk us through your philosophy there, that would be helpful.
Matt Meloy: Yes, sure, Jeremy, just first on the tax piece, because of the basis step-up that will be happening inside TRC, we see zero taxes, Joe Bob said for the foreseeable future, it's – well beyond five years, we don't estimate being a taxpayer depending on what EBITDA and other assumptions you use because of the step-up inside TRC, we think we'll be in a low to zero tax position for a very long time, kind of through our five-year plus forecast horizon and then even beyond that. So, TRC is going to be in a good tax position going forward with this transaction. And then coverage, our long-term coverage target is still going to be 1.1X to 1.2X. We know the cases that we laid out had lower coverage than that. Joe Bob mentioned in his remarks we're going to working towards finding additional projects and trying to improve on that forecast that we gave to try and get our coverage back to those target levels. But right now, just with the assumptions that we put in and the forecast that the Board looked at, it kind of resulted in some declining coverage over time. We're going to try and do better than those forecasts. Those forecasts have $600 million of growth CapEx approximately by year. We have a lot of other opportunities that might be able to add some economic projects to help fill in some of that.
Jeremy Tonet: That's great, thanks. And then just one last one for me if could now hop back in the queue, did you preview the deal with the rating agencies, and if you did, did you have any initial responses there?
Matt Meloy: Yes, we spoke to the rating agencies. We would expect them to be coming out shortly with their view, given that the financing structure is essentially the same yesterday as it will be pro forma the transaction, we don't see a material difference happening. I think over time, the improved credit profile, because of higher retained cash flows, is going to be a net positive to the rating agencies, but it's essentially the same capital structure before the deal and after the deal.
Jeremy Tonet: Great, thanks, I'll hop back in the queue.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Blossman with Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Company. Your line is now open.
Joe Bob Perkins: Morning, Brandon.
Matt Meloy: Good morning, Brandon.
Brandon Blossman: Good morning. Joe Bob, as you talked with the board about the roll-off transaction, was this just a gradual evolution that tipped it in the balance or in favor of this way forward, this path forward or was there something kind of specific that you can point to that changed over the last, call it, six months to nine months that led you in this direction?
Joe Bob Perkins: The strategic assessments have been going on for some time and the buy-in transaction has been on that list. It sort of gave me two choices, I would say the choice of a gradual evolution was the better of the two. Dialogue, analysis, would say that there was not a deal there until this weekend. The TRP Conflicts Committee, the TRC Board and later the TRP Board, following management's recommendation, were first analyzing it as a possibility among many and then came to agreement that they should consider it specifically for a short period of time. And I'm pleased to say across the weekend we believed that we could make it happen, and yesterday, into last evening, worked on the specific details that were contingent to both sides supporting it.
Brandon Blossman: Okay, fair enough and probably a good weekend.
Joe Bob Perkins: That weekend description should still sound like, I think your gradual evolution towards the answer.
Brandon Blossman: Fair enough. And then as you think about equity needs beyond – sounds like you're good for 2015, but beyond 2015, any general color that you'd be willing to share around equity needs and path forward on that. And then specifically, any comments that you're willing to share on the preferred equity market relative to your experience in the market recently?
Matt Meloy: Sure, relative to funding needs for 2016, we've typically targeted about a 50% mix of debt, 50% equity. And in the forecast, in that consensus case, that's approximately what we assume for those leverage metrics targets for the forecast period, so we're pretty close to that 50:50 in that environment. And then of course we'll look and make a determination on a year-by-year basis. Some years will be more debt, some years will be more equity, and we'll always have to make the best judgment at the time. We issued preferred at NGLS. Issuing NGLS common was getting, in our view, was not the lowest cost of capital and the best means to issue, so we went out with the preferred equity issuance earlier this year at NGLS. We raised $125 million. So I'd say that is something that we'll continue to look at. And if it makes sense and it's a lower piece of capital than our other alternatives, it's something we will consider. So that could be a piece of the additional equity needs for 2016 as well.
Brandon Blossman: Okay. Joe Bob, Matt, thank you very much.
Matt Meloy: Thank you, Brandon.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of TJ Schultz with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Matt Meloy: Hi, TJ.
TJ Schultz: Hi, good morning. So you've listed before, I think, $3 billion to $4 billion of additional opportunities in kind of various stages of development. So if more projects now conceivably cross your return threshold, can you put any numbers around what you may be able to extend this backlog to or are there projects that maybe had been delayed to where you now have some level of confidence on exceeding that $600 million per year growth CapEx in a better commodity environment that you've laid out?
Joe Bob Perkins: TJ, I think the last part of the question, you started answering it, or at least from my perspective. The delay in those projects, most of them are when, not if, kind of projects, have been more driven by commodity prices and producer activity and downstream activity than delayed by our cost of capital. For the bulk of them and the ones that have visibility, that's certainly the case. So I think levels of capital investment are indicated in those example scenarios. We have more CapEx in the base-case consensus scenario than we do in the lower-price scenario. And that's kind of how I think it will play out. I'm pretty sure that we will not experience either one of those smooth commodity price curves and that activity will be a function of where we are in the price curves and where we are in the forwards.
TJ Schultz: Okay, got it. And then it sounds like you still want to get debt leverage to 3X to 4X. If you could just discuss that goal in the context of what you laid out in the different scenarios through 2018 when you might envision getting to sub 4X leverage and the emphasis that you place there versus coverage or growth in the dividends?
Matt Meloy: Yes, good question. If you look at the presentation in that consensus pricing case, we have 4.3 and it's relatively flat debt-to-EBITDA forecast. That's pretty closed to the high end of our target. We'd prefer that number to be 4.0 or lower. So, it's something we'll have to look at, whether it's – have to watch. If EBITDA could come in a little bit stronger than our forecast or we may issue a little bit more equity for our CapEx, maybe more than 50:50. But at 4.3 we're not – I'm a lot more comfortable between 3 and 4, but 4.3 doesn't give us any huge concern over here either.
Joe Bob Perkins: Particularly relative to forecasting that we believe has some conservative elements.
Matt Meloy: Right.
TJ Schultz: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. I'll leave it there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your line is now open.
Shneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning guys.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning.
Matt Meloy: Good morning.
Shneur Gershuni: Lot of my questions have been asked and answered, but I kind of have a few follow-ups and actually one operational question as well to you. From the way I look at it, it appears like your cash flow metrics are improving, so it sounds like the agency should be – view it positively and so forth. But I guess the real question I have is, less than a month ago, you came into the marketplace to do an offering, you did the preferred and so forth. What changed in that month that you decided you needed to take these steps to improve cash flow even further? I was just wondering if you can sort of give us that color, is this defensive in nature? Just trying to understand kind of the process, where you were at the beginning of October versus where you were this weekend when you made this decision?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, I'm glad someone asked that question, because it can appear based on what you see publicly that that was sequenced the way you just described it, that's not the case. The strategic alternative assessment has been going on well across that October 5 announcement across the issue of the retail preferred, and management and the Board, on things that the Board – the Boards plural – and things that they had to approve, were managing the company the way we needed to manage the company if no strategic alternative levers were pulled. In fact, the retail preferred was on the strategic alternative levers for a long time, that's a good move regardless of doing this buy-in or not doing this buy-in. It's an additive tool to the overall capital structure at a cost of equity that was significantly cheaper than NGLS. So, please out there, don't interpret that something changed from the time we were doing those financings, for example, right after Labor Day when we did notes, we needed to do notes. It was good timing, nice window. For example, the retail preferred, we wanted to put that club in our golf bag and be able to use it later. And Matt said he's going to continue to use that later if it works with our other equity opportunities.
Shneur Gershuni: Okay. So it's fair to conclude no change in your assumptions on the base business over the last month, it's just the process evolved effectively?
Joe Bob Perkins: I also am glad you asked the questions about whether it was defensive. The defensive nature of this is related to trying to manage, and we've been trying to manage since the first part of the year, what we look like in a lower-for-longer. This is a stronger target in lower-for-longer. And we're not planning on lower-for-longer, but we want to be ready and positioned for it. And this move positions us for those kind of price scenarios just as it positions us well for improvements in the higher-price, better recovery price scenarios.
Shneur Gershuni: Okay. And maybe if I can ask an operational question. When I look at your OpEx and SG&A numbers for this quarter, it's certainly better than what we were expecting and it seems like an interesting trend. Do you expect us to see continued improvements in OpEx and SG&A savings in 4Q and throughout 2016, kind of something similar to what we're seeing in the E&P space on capital efficiencies?
Joe Bob Perkins: Two things; one, you get to see our numbers kind of rolled up together, okay. And beginning in the first part of the year, we're going to add Buffalo and we're going to add Train 5 and there's going to be additional OpEx coming with those, just by that very nature, we've got to hire some operators for them, for example. However, yes, I expect continued operating expense and capital improvements across the company. I expect. Now I'm doing forecasting. I believe that we will largely offset those increases for Buffalo and Train 5 with the cost savings that we're achieving. Because everybody is really focused on it, we've got area managers working together. Mike, was it three weeks ago, we had maybe third area manager meeting of the year. Those guys are sharing best practices across the entire footprint, very focused, and in every one of those sessions I see the energy of, here is the good ideas I've been doing. What have you been trying to do about this? Wow! I bet I could do that also. That's why I believe that there will continue to be cost saving by asset and potentially even cost savings despite bringing on more assets. G&A is not dissimilar.
Shneur Gershuni: Okay, great. Thank you very much and congratulations guys.
Matt Meloy: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gabe Moreen with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Gabe Moreen: Good morning everyone. Just a specific follow-up question on the credit ratings question. Is it your expectation on your part that TRGP's rating gets shifted around here at all?
Matt Meloy: Yes, I think there is a pretty good opportunity for them to either equalize or upgrade possibly TRC since we'll have the – it will all be one credit family. So I think they're going to come out with more specifics around that, and we'll have to have subsequent discussions once we get through close how they're going to look at that. But I think there is an opportunity for the TRC standalone ratings to potentially improve.
Gabe Moreen: Thanks Matt. And then kind of a follow-up to the tax savings questions, I realize there is a bunch of different scenarios with one instance or for some instances when you do have this roll-off transactions, management has been willing to give an aggregate cash tax savings number expected over a period of time. Is that something you'd be willing to do or is that just too difficult given the different scenarios out there?
Matt Meloy: Yes, good question. We talked about that. I think where we're more comfortable in saying is we just don't expect to be a cash taxpayer for an extended period of time. You're right, there is a bunch of different ways to calculate that PV, how long, what scenario, how much CapEx to spend and the like, so I think we're just more comfortable saying we don't expect to be a cash taxpayer.
Joe Bob Perkins: And that means across multiple scenarios?
Matt Meloy: Right.
Gabe Moreen: Got it, thanks, Matt. And then, last one from me and Joe Bob in terms of having a lower prospective equity cost of capital, hopefully here after the roll-off, does it change your approach in terms of deploying CapEx and hurdle rates here given that you won't have the IDR structures in the burden there?
Joe Bob Perkins: We've been pretty open on these calls that with the higher cost of capital that we were experiencing with NGLS, we had sent the signal to our organization to insist upon higher returns in the contractual negations, their asset planning projects. And I believe that they have done so. I still believe that the bulk of major projects meet our sort of thresholds in either world. But there are some other smaller ones, medium-size ones that probably don't come to us, and I am aware of projects that we would have done in the past that would not be brought to us in the recent higher cost of capital environment. So, I believe it's a positive – positive over time, but we had an earlier question that said, how much more projects are you going to do because of that. I think that that's an overly aggressive way of trying to model it. Instead, the projects we are doing will bring us higher net returns and some projects on the margin that might not have been brought forward for approval are likely to come forward.
Gabe Moreen: Understood. Thanks, Joe Bob.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sachin Shah with Albert Fried. Your line is now open.
Sachin Shah: Hi, good afternoon. Congratulations on the deal. I know you guys mentioned how you guys review the strategic alternatives, but just wanted to understand the premium that's being paid here. I know all units are stock, but just wanted to kind of go through that process. You mentioned that because of commodity prices being where they are and you're expecting them to – forecast them to be where they are, that might have an influence on it. So, just wanted to understand that a little bit better. And then also just, it seems pretty simple. Unit holder vote, HSR and that's pretty much it, so just want to confirm that? Thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: From the back side to the front side of those questions, yes the approvals are not expected to be a big deal on the regulatory front. We are there (0:59:13) on the acquisition and HSR should be quickly terminated. It's just a taxing opportunity at this point. As far as the premium management, our conversations with our Boards and the Conflicts Committee recognize that premium is a result, not an objective as we were discussing this. It's the exchange ratio that is the economic trait and that 0.62 exchange ratio was – ratios around that were evaluated by both sides. I'm not going to describe the trade-off of things and the scheme of things, but in reality, the premium, this 18% premium was a function of what day we got the deal done on, not an objective.
Sachin Shah: Okay, thank you. Congratulations, again.
Matt Meloy: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kiani with Teilinger Capital [ph]. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning.
Matt Meloy: Hey, John, how are you?
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning, John.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks for providing the additional outlook to 2017 and 2018, it's helpful. Can you please explain what you're assuming for the LPG export volumes in that business and also pricing as well in that 2017 and 2018 timeframe in your forecast and the consensus to lower case, at least directionally compared to what we're seeing today, please?
Matt Meloy: Yes, and I'll start with the easier answer. In the presentation, if you flip through, we have the commodity price assumptions laid out for both the consensus pricing and the strip, that's on page six and it's on page eight, so we've got the WTI, NGL and natural gas. For the LPG exports, we've given guidance for next year, for 2016. We would expect 5 million or more barrels per month for 2016. We have not given and we don't have in our assumptions an assumption for 2017 and 2018, so we aren't giving that color for 2017 and 2018, but just 2016.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it, okay. So, there's obviously some assumptions that you all made in both scenarios for the LPG export business in 2017 and 2018 on both price and volume, but you're just not going to disclose that at this time?
Matt Meloy: Right, we'll share 2016 with you.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Okay. And I have a second question that's unrelated please. Can you just talk through the thought process in how you got comfortable with the credit exposure when you entered into the Eagle Ford JV with Sanchez Energy, just considering the company's credit rating and with their bonds yield and the teams and whatnot? Could you talk through how you're planning to manage their credit exposure and what your thought process was in getting comfortable with that?
Matt Meloy: Sure, we took a look at Sanchez's financials, had discussions with their management, cash forecast. They've got today significant cash in their balance sheet and they are in good position to continue drilling for, in our view, an extended period of time to continue to drill. We've also, through the 50:50 ownership in the processing plant and in the assets, they're going to be incentivized and whether it's them or another party if they were – if there's any transaction, they will be incentivized to continue to flow down the assets that we own because the other party owns 50%. So, Sanchez has incentivized the flow through the gathering, through the processing. And anyone else that own those assets would be incentivized to flow down those gathering pipes and the processing plant.
Unidentified Analyst: I see, then, do you have any type of guarantee from them? Is it at the project level? Is it at the corporate level? How do you think about managing your credit exposure in general in the event of the outlook changing?
Joe Bob Perkins: John, the team here, we've got a very strong financial risk management team. You should assume that we've done everything we can within contracts, et cetera, to protect ourselves. I was having discussions with our board that there was a great deal of thought and creativity that went into those agreements, but we've got CAs on what is actually in those agreements, that was mitigated to the maximum extent possible is probably the right way to put it. And we feel good about this as a standalone project. Sanchez, I understand people are saying about their – sort of where their equity is and what the credit might look like. They're a very good operator and they've had very good success in what people thought was a less productive part of the Eagle Ford and we will benefit greatly from those volume commitments and the drilling requirement that's associated with the original shale leases is public for Sanchez or whoever else to hold on to that lease. So, in the scheme of things, big picture, this is a good deal for Targa.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks, Joe Bob, thanks, Matt.
Joe Bob Perkins: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Edwards with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Edwards: Good morning, everybody.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hey, John.
John Edwards: And just to follow-up on some of the other questions. I'm just curious, in terms of making this announcement on the restructuring, how much did the leverage and relatively low distribution coverage weigh on this decision and on the decision to announce it at this time?
Joe Bob Perkins: I think those numbers certainly were important factors in the decision which is why we took you through pages six through nine in some detail. It certainly managed – was a big part of management's recommendation because entering into this transaction creates that stronger Targa regardless of price environment. I feel really good about sort of this next future step for Targa and what it looks like. I don't feel very good about my ability to predict commodity prices. And I believe that the boards and the TRC Conflicts Committee looking at those factors or similar factors reached a similar conclusion that all of our stakeholders were better off regardless of the commodity price scenario you pick with this new transaction.
John Edwards: Okay. All right. So it sounds like it's been weighing on the process for some time, because you said you've been looking at this since almost a year ago and so that...
Joe Bob Perkins: I don't know that I would describe weighing on the process. Our forecast which we forecast and re-forecast kind of all the time have done the best we can to contemplate what does Targa look like in a variety of price scenarios. These are two illustrative ones. And coverage and leverage are something we're trying to manage all the time.
John Edwards: Okay. All right, thanks. My other questions have been asked. Thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, John.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thanks, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Faisel Khan: Thanks, good afternoon. I understand you don't want to give us the NPV or PV of the tax situation that occurs from this transaction, but can you give us the deferred tax asset that's created from this transaction or the tax basis step-up, so that we can sort of calculate sort of the NPV on our own?
Matt Meloy: Okay. I don't have, we're working through obviously the accounting impact of what will go on the books, but just, simplistically, the total transaction value is about $12 billion for the total transactions and you back off the units that we already own, that won't be receiving the step up and then you can split that on a amortization schedule. So, we assume most of the step up would be getting seven-year makers and then there is some that's going to be straight-lined over a longer period of time, call it 14 years, 15 years.
Faisel Khan: Okay. Great, that's what I was looking for. And then, on your POP contracts, can you discuss a little bit about, what's going on with some of those contracts, and what I mean by that is some of your other peers have sort of talked about collecting revenues on ancillary services that they may have not been collecting revenues on before on some of those POP contracts because of the common language that exists in some of those contracts. Can you talk a little bit about, if you have those same sort of opportunities and if those are things that are sort of taking place in the current oil and NGL price environment?
Joe Bob Perkins: I know it may be a new topic, but it's a very old thing for Targa to be managing our Gathering & Processing contracts to add these to POP and I think we've publicly described it for at least 9 years or 10 years. Constantly doing that, when you get in a different price environment there may be more opportunities to try to do that. So, it's been a constant effort for us and we sort of haven't described it as anything new or different, trying to be fee based where we can like North Dakota. Some people are now trying to switch from POP to fee based in North Dakota which means they will look more like our contracts. And as we look at POP contracts coming up where we have attractive competitive position, we're trying to improve those terms both on the terms of the POP and on the fee. We talk of a POP contract anytime it has a POP component but some ours are really hybrids. They maybe – the margin impact maybe as large on the fee side as it is on the POP side in the current contract forms and that effort continues.
Faisel Khan: And Joe just to the extent that, you've been working on this with your legacy contracts at Targa for the last several years, what about with the Atlas contracts, I mean how much more work is there to do on that area?
Joe Bob Perkins: The TPL set of assets are now being managed as one family. In their history they had switched some from POP to fee at a time that was important for them to do so, and those efforts continue. I think there are still opportunities there for additional fees and/or improved POP just as there are additional opportunities for that as contracts come up and as new acreage dedications are achieved, and as new contracts are reached as we extend our systems.
Faisel Khan: Okay. Thanks for the time.
Matt Meloy: Okay, thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: Mike was telling me to remind everybody that much of our P&P portfolio is already primarily fee, essentially 100% fee. I mentioned the Badlands, much of Oklahoma, South Texas is all fee.
Matt Meloy: Okay, next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jerren Holder with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jerren Holder: Hi, good morning, thanks for taking the call. I just wanted to clarify maybe the price sensitivity scenario and what exactly is that based on, is that just forward curve pricing or something else, and based on the forward curve, do you still get the sort of growth and coverage metrics?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, that was based on the forward curve some time ago when we pulled that, so you see gas was around $3, crude was $47 going to low and then the mid $50s. And then for the NGL we looked at the forward curve as well, but then increased prices, you will see it kind of increasing with the crude oil contango [ph]. So, I would say it was strip base but it wasn't just simply a strip on this day and we used it, we've kind of looked at it over a period of time and then made the adjustment to NGLs.
Jerren Holder: Got it, and I guess given the long-term coverage targets, kind of 1.1X, 1.2X and just in both scenarios where we are sort of moving away from that, how do you think about growing the dividend whether its 15%, 10her its%, whatever the metric is versus say getting back to that 1.1X to 1.2X sort of target sooner just given the variability in the earnings model from commodity prices and volumes.
Joe Bob Perkins: And I would say it would – you know how we think about any years coverage really does depend on our longer term view for where coverage is going. So if we're able to add projects and we are able to add EBITDA and it's a relatively healthier environment as we are looking out, it's not necessarily a target of 1.1X to 1.2X in 12 months or 24 months out. We will look out several years. We will look at our project backlog, look at the environment, and then make an assessment for how much of that coverage we would want to distribute and then how much we would want to keep, and so that's a decision we will kind of make on a quarterly basis, but we will take all those factors given the environment, given price contango, project backlog and the like and just have to make that call as we go throughout this forecast.
Jerren Holder: Thanks. And then last one from me, the compliance – the levers compliance covenants and so – I guess there is the 5.5X at TRP, but at TRC there isn't any, can you I guess talk a little bit about that evolving as on a pro forma business?
Joe Bob Perkins: So at TRP there is the 5.5X covenant and that remains unchanged and that's going to be the governor or that's where we will have less room under our compliance being low 4X relative to 5.5X. Once this buy in occurs, all the cash flows will be flowing out of TRP up through TRC and will be available for that credit facility at the TRC level. So pro forma for this transaction is going to be under 1X debt-to-EBITDA, so if you're okay on compliance at TRP, you're going to be okay on compliance at TRC. So that's why we didn't highlight or talk about it, it's a 4X what – it steps down over time but it's 4.75X down to 4X debt-to-EBITDA up at TRC standalone and pro forma for this will be less than 1.0X.
Jerren Holder: And I guess going forward you can just raise debt at TRC and not have to do it at the TRP level?
Joe Bob Perkins: So we would have options and flexibility there whether we wanted to raise debt at TRP or TRC. I would say likely raising incremental notes offering given most of our notes are at or all of our notes are at TRP, that would likely be our primary funding mechanism and place that we would go. But we've issued debt at TRC before so that is an option, but we would be able to – where we should be able to do either.
Jerren Holder: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hi, Michael.
Michael Blum: Thank you. Hi. So I think we've covered mostly everything. Just one question remaining for me Joe Bob. I think in your prepared remarks you said that one of the benefits of the interest transaction was it would reduce your external financing needs going forward. And I guess, I'm just trying to understand what you meant by that?
Joe Bob Perkins: On the first level Michael covering that not negative, but less than one coverage and increasing interest expense relative to that by saving the $400 million to $600 million in these two illustrative scenarios is a benefit to our external capital needs.
Michael Blum: Okay, great. Thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Chris Sighinolfi: Good afternoon, guys.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hey, Chris.
Chris Sighinolfi: I appreciate the color this morning and for you taking my question. I've just had a couple of quick follow ups, one just operational in nature. I was just curious what drove the large sequential step up in South Texas inlet volumes, didn't know it was a change in reporting convention given the joint venture? And as a related question we didn't see the same step up in total liquids production there. So I was just wondering what sort of drove that discrepancy, if you had a good explanation.
Joe Bob Perkins: That sequential step up was not driven at all by the Sanchez arrangement. And I actually need to look back at the numbers. I don't think it was very large. There was not a NGL increase because NGLs are primarily taken kind from the current Silver Oak facilities.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. I will follow-up afterwards with Jen perhaps on that. And then just two quick questions on the transaction itself, Matt I appreciate all the prior color you've offered previous questioners. I was curious with regard to the slide nine in your presentation deck. I think you had mentioned $600 million of growth capital in each of these units. I just didn't know if I looked at the price sensitivity portion of that slide presentation, if that was also true under that scenario and then if you had any color in terms of financing assumptions that you had assumed. I know you went back and forth with Jerren around opportunities but are you assuming additional leverage to finance this or something other than that?
Matt Meloy: Okay. So, to your first question is kind of what's the CapEx amount in that price sensitivity case. So the $600 million I mentioned was for the Street consensus price case, the higher price case. In the price sensitivity case, if you look on page 15, we outlined the growth CapEx assumptions and it's about $400 million in 2017 and $225 million in 2018, so there is less CapEx assumed in the price sensitivity case.
Chris Sighinolfi: Perfect, sorry I missed that. And did you have – and had you said earlier how you were planning to finance that or is it just a wait and see?
Joe Bob Perkins: I think what I said earlier was for the price consensus case that it was approximately 50:50 is the assumption that we use in the model. Going forward I'd say in the price sensitive case, it's slightly – it is a bit of a higher ratio. We did a little bit more equity financing for the price sensitivity case in a similar dollar amount.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay, perfect. And then finally and I realize this may sound a little obtuse, but is there anything that limits or precludes you from creating an MLP again in a future period?
Joe Bob Perkins: Good question and I did ask that and no there is nothing specifically that prohibits us from doing another MLP.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. Thanks a lot for the time this morning.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Gupta [ph] with HITE Hedge. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good afternoon. Couple of quick questions from me. One is on LPG exports. Can you help us understand how you're thinking about the competitive nature here, several projects are coming on line towards the end of this year into next year? What are you sort of seeing in terms of utilization and specifically how it might impact yourselves? You've got a very good facility down there in Houston Ship Channel, are you seeing any impact on potential margins in 2016 or beyond.
Joe Bob Perkins: I'd say we are in – we feel like we're in a good position to continue to meet customers' needs through our facility. We took that into consideration when we came out with our expectations for 2016 of 5 million barrels a month or higher. We know there is additional capacity coming online but that was taken into account in our numbers. Yes, we said we're 4.2 million barrels per month or greater contracted for 2016. And so we feel like for 2016 we're in good position, we have a good set of assets and a good track record of being able to deliver and meet our customers need.
Unidentified Analyst: How about margin, with increased competition do you expect some erosion there or now compared to 2015?
Joe Bob Perkins: We said on our last call with a similar question, sort of depends on how you're describing erosion. Long-term margins are similar to the way they've been in our short history of having VLCC shipments from our facility. The spot margins were higher in the first part of 2014 than they have been in 2015. But, beyond that we haven't given a whole lot of color. What you see is the results, the economic results of volumes continuing. They are kind of similar on that margin to the extent you can calculate them. And I think that that's not a whole lot of erosion. The big erosion was with super spiked spot opportunities back in 2014 to what our sort of current level is today.
Unidentified Analyst: Sure, that makes sense. And, on leverage one quick follow up. Your target of trying to get to 4x, would you consider that on a consolidated basis?
Joe Bob Perkins: So our leverage target since we went public with the TRP in February of 2007, it was 3X to 4X debt-to-EBITDA. And so for right now what we're saying is, we're just going to leave that unchanged at the TRP level, target the 3X to 4X. As we move forward in time does that evolve to a consolidated look as we have discussions with the agencies? Possibly. But I think right now, we'll just kind of stick with our 3X to 4X leverage target at TRP.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, well, thanks and congrats again.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks.
Matt Meloy: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.
Sunil Sibal: Hi, good morning guys. All of my questions have been answered, thanks for your time.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you very much.
Matt Meloy: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We have a follow-up question from the line of Brandon Blossman with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Your line is now open.
Brandon Blossman: Yes.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hi, Brandon.
Brandon Blossman: Matt, just real quick, on the two forecast scenarios...
Matt Meloy: Brandon, we can't hear you.
Brandon Blossman: How about that? Can you hear me?
Joe Bob Perkins: There you go.
Brandon Blossman: Sorry about that. Now, on the two forecast scenarios, is there any different assumptions on volume throughput between the two cases?
Matt Meloy: Good question. We assumed essentially the same volumes. We ran the volume outlook using that price sensitivity case, using that lower strip case and came up with where we thought volumes would be for the next several years. And then we did – it's a price sensitivity. There are some other adjustments Joe Bob talked about, but it's essentially a price response to get to that higher price case.
Brandon Blossman: Okay.
Joe Bob Perkins: There is some more CapEx here, there is higher CapEx so there is project related to the EBITDA so you could say, maybe there's some volume assumption with that, but generally speaking it's more or less price sensitivity.
Brandon Blossman: That's helpful, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Charles Marshall with Capital One. Your line is now open.
Charles Marshall: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Two quick questions regarding the ATM program. Did you issue any equity this quarter?
Matt Meloy: In the ATM we did not issue any since our call last. I think we had a small piece before our earnings call in July, but we've been effectively out of the ATM at NGLS since our last earnings call.
Charles Marshall: Okay, I appreciate that. And then just related to the ATM again...
Joe Bob Perkins: The retail preferred equity...
Matt Meloy: Yes, but not ATM.
Charles Marshall: Got it. And then just on a pro forma basis what happens with the ATM program, will TRGP have a similar program?
Matt Meloy: The ATM has worked well for us at NGLS. So that's something that we'll take a hard look at, does not make sense up at TRGP. We've had good success at NGLS using that. So that's certainly something we'll consider at TRGP.
Charles Marshall: Okay, thanks. And then just one last one for me. I guess, more of a follow up to previous questions. Given the lower expected cost of capital on a pro forma basis, how does your opportunity set or appetite change from potential M&A now going forward versus your opportunities that you're taking a look at in this current environment in the current structure of your two entities?
Joe Bob Perkins: I don't think we've contemplated the opportunity set being affected by the new structure and lower cost of capital. When we think about acquisitions we're always thinking first about what is the assets and businesses that you might acquire and whether it would fit the target and whether we could add value to it. And then we look at whether the math would work. Obviously, in the higher cost of capital that we were experiencing with NGLS we had said at least on a couple of calls that smaller bolt-on's are the more likely things to occur in the near to medium term. I still think that's our primary focus. But we always look at lots of things. Just the math may not work as well. In the environment where we had only the higher cost of NGLS for all practical purposes to utilize and with a more competitive cost of capital, it may help sometime in the future.
Charles Marshall: Okay, I appreciate the color. Thanks guys.
Matt Meloy: Okay, thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: Operator, we don't have any other questions. Excuse me, that's what they are telling me at the table. Besides that we've gone on for an hour and a half. I think we ought to bring it to a close. We very much appreciate everyone's patience as we went through the material. I certainly enjoyed the Q&A with you all and hope that we have been able to shed light on both third quarter performance and this exciting and attractive announcement that we made today. If you have any other questions, please give us call and have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Kneale, Senior Director of Finance. You may begin.
Jennifer Kneale: Thank you, Nicole. I'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2015 investor call for both Targa Resources Corp. and Targa Resources Partners LP. Before we get started, I would like to mention that Targa Resources Corp., TRC, or the Company and Targa Resources Partners LP, Targa Resources Partners or the Partnership, have published their joint earnings release, which is available on our website at www.targaresources.com. We will also be posting an updated investor presentation to the website later today. I would like to remind you that any statements made during this call that might include the Company’s or the Partnership’s expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Please note that actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings, including the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Speaking on the call today will be Joe Bob Perkins, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Meloy, Chief Financial Officer. Joe Bob will start off with a high level review of performance and highlights. He will then turn it over to Matt to review the Partnership’s consolidated financial results, segments results and other financial matters. Matt will also review key financial matters related to Targa Resources Corp. Following Matt’s comments Joe Bob will provide some concluding remarks and then we will take your questions. There are also several other members of the management team available who may assist in the Q&A session. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe Bob Perkins.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Jen. Welcome everybody and thank you for joining us this morning. I’d like to remind you that this is the first reported quarter that includes the full quarter of results from our Targa Pipeline or TPL assets, which were a partner on merger that closed on February 27. As we describe our results from the quarter, the inclusion of TPL in Field Gathering & Processing segment, naturally will be the biggest factor in a number of increases as we compare results to last year and to last quarter. Turning to Targa’s second quarter results. Our reported second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $303 million as compared to $229 million for the second quarter of last year. This 33% increase was driven primarily by the inclusion of TPL’s assets for the full quarter, which more than offset lower commodity prices. Our distributable cash flow for the quarter of $219 million resulted in distribution coverage of approximately 1.1 times based on our second quarter declared distribution of $0.825 or $3.30 per common unit on an annualized basis. The Partnership’s second quarter distribution represents a 6% increase compared to the second quarter of 2014. At the TRC level, the second quarter dividend of $0.875 or $3.50 per common share annualized represents a 27% increase compared to the second quarter of 2014. Through the price swings we have seen to-date in 2015, our Field Gathering and Processing volumes continued to grow through the first six months of the year compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Natural gas inlet volumes increased in the second quarter compared to fourth quarter across eight of our nine systems. Overall, Field Gathering and Processing volumes were up more than 5% second quarter of 2015 over fourth quarter of 2014. For the second quarter versus fourth quarter, we experienced a slight volume decrease in North Texas from reduced activity levels and from the impacts of severe flooding in the area. In the absence of the commodity price rally, we expect that North Texas volumes are likely to decline for the balance of the year. All of our other field operations had volume increases versus the fourth quarter of 2014. And as we look at expected volumes for the balance of the year in the Permian Basin, the Badlands and SouthOK, we expect some continued growth in each of these areas. As you are all well aware, commodity prices continue to be volatile. In May and June, spot crude prices rallied to over $60 per barrel and recently fell below $50 per barrel. Yesterday WTI was about $46 per barrel. While there continues to be uncertainty on price and related activity levels, our current expectations for average 2015 field GMP volumes is 3% to 5% overall growth in 2015 versus Q4 2014. This is slightly higher than our previous guidance of flat to low-single digit growth on the same comparison. For the most part, we are seeing continued activity around our field GMP areas of operations, but obviously less than we were experiencing in 2014. We are also seeing Targa’s strong operational capabilities, reputation for customer service and willingness to spend capital selectively for attractive projects that have allowed us to capture some existing and future producer volumes from other Midstream companies. Predicting 2016 field GMP volumes continues to be more ordinate science. Producers have demonstrated their willingness to increase their pace of drilling in almost all of our areas if crude prices improve to for example $60 per barrel. However, our ability to predict 2016 prices and therefore produce our expectations for those prices has not improved. In April, we said that if commodity prices didn’t improve April levels, average 2016 field GMP volumes maybe lower than 2015. Predicting 2016 field GMP volumes continues to be difficult, but I want to say that we generally feel a bit more optimistic about volumes than we did at the first of the year. Now, as we said, we project that 3% to 5% volume growth from Q4 2014 to average 2015, which slightly puts Targa at a better 2016 beginning spot than we were expecting. Looking at DOE US onshore oil production data, we see a decline in April and May, which probably is a good thing for the industry. That’s obviously the net result of some areas growing and some areas declining. We are seeing growth in our most important areas and expect that to continue at least through the near term, proving that we have strong positioning. So we feel a bit more optimistic for 2015 and to some extent 2016, not because of an improved price outlook, but because of volume results to-date. Moving to downstream, our Logistics and Marketing division operating margin for the second quarter of 2015 was slightly higher than the same time period last year. As for full year 2015, I guess we reaffirm our guidance of Logistics and Marketing division operating margin may be modestly lower than 2014. In the second quarter, we exploited approximately 5 million barrels per month of LPGs, which was 3% higher than the second quarter of 2014. Demand for LPG exports has been impacted by global commodity prices in the tight shipping market, but we are seeing continued demand for short and long-term contracts and we have continued to add contracts for the second half of 2015 and beyond. We expect our LPG export activity levels to be at or above Q2 volumes for the remainder of the year. Given our contract portfolio, current market dynamics related to commodity prices shipping constraints and increased competition, we expect overall second half LPG export operating margins may approximate what we have seen so far this year. Across our other businesses, we have worked hard through the first two quarters of the year to reduce operating expenses, especially in the field GMP businesses without sacrificing safety or preventative maintenance and while still meeting customer needs for growing volumes. With the inclusion of TPL and the addition of assets throughout 2014 and early 2015, and because fuel and power consumption are included in expenses, it’s difficult to see the savings in our reported numbers. When we look at our internal numbers for full year 2015, we currently expect field GMP operating expenses to be approximately 8% lower than our budgeted expectations despite the increase in volumes we have been experiencing being gathered in process. Our performance in the second quarter highlights the diversity and resiliency of our business mix. There were some pluses and minuses, but overall it was a strong performance quarter in the context of weak commodity prices. Given the first two quarters of distribution announcements at TRP, our 2015 distribution growth over 2014 is likely to be towards the lower end of our 4% to 7% distribution growth guidance. At TRC, we continue to expect 25% or better dividend growth in 2015 over 2014. That wraps up my initial comments and now I will hand it over to Matt. Matt?
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Joe Bob. I’d like to add my welcome and thank you for joining our call today. As Joe Bob mentioned, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $303 million compared to $229 million for the same period last year. The increase was driven by the addition of the TPL assets, which are reported in our field GMP segment. Overall operating margin increased 17% for the second quarter compared to the same time period last year and I’ll review the drivers of this performance in the segment reviews. Net maintenance capital expenditures were $28 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $20 million in the second quarter of 2014 driven by the inclusion of TPL operations offset by some of the cost savings Joe Bob discussed across all of our operating areas. Turning to the segment level, I’ll summarize the second quarter performance on a year-over-year basis, and we will start with our downstream business. In our Logistics and Marketing division, our second quarter operating margin increased 1% compared to the first quarter 2015 driven by partial recognition of the payment received from Noble related to our condensate splitter project, increased terminaling and storage activities and higher fractionation volumes. Fractionation volumes increased by 3% versus the same time period last year and overall operating margin from fractionation was down slightly as a result of lower system product gains and higher maintenance cost. We loaded an average of 5 million barrels per month of LPG for exports and second quarter 2015 operating margin from LPG exports was approximately flat compared to the same time period last year. In our Gathering and Processing division, our Field Gathering and Processing segment operating margin increased by 41% compared to last year largely driven by the inclusion of TPL. Second quarter 2015 natural gas plant inlet volumes for the Field Gathering and Processing segment were 2.67 billion cubic feet per day, 195% increase compared to the same period in 2014. The overall increase in natural gas inlet volumes was due to the inclusion of TPL volumes in West Texas, South Texas, SouthOK and WestOK and increases in each of the following business units, 34% at SAOU, 23% at Badlands, 9% at Versado and 7% at Sand Hills. Inlet volumes at North Texas approximated second quarter 2014 levels and as Joe Bob mentioned, we are impacted by severe flooding conditions and subsequent impacts that affected the area throughout the spring. Crude oil gathered increased to 106,000 barrels per day in the second quarter, a 27% increase versus the same time period last year. For the Field Gathering and Processing segment, commodity prices were down across the board, with NGL prices decreasing by 52%, condensate prices decreasing by 47% and natural gas prices decreasing by 45% compared to the second quarter of 2014. Our hedging activities, which mitigate a portion of these price swings are included in our other operating segment. In our Coastal Gathering and Processing segment, operating margin was down 70% in the second quarter of 2015 versus the same time period last year as Gulf of Mexico and Onshore Gulf Coast volumes continue to decrease. Let’s now move to capital structure, liquidity and other matters. As of June 30, we had 878 million of outstanding borrowings under the Partnership's 1.6 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due 2017. With outstanding letters of credit of 21 million, revolver availability was about 702 million at quarter end. Total liquidity, including approximately 86 million of cash on hand, was about 787 million. At quarter end, we had borrowings of 124 million under our 300 million accounts receivable securitization facility. Year-to-date, we have received net proceeds of approximately 375 million from equity issuances, including general partner contributions. For April through July, we received approximately 263 million of net proceeds from asset market equity issuances and obliged $316 million in net proceeds under the ATM equity program year-to-date. On a debt compliance basis, which provides us adjusted EBITDA credit per material growth projects that are in process but not yet in complete and makes other adjustments, TRP’s total compliance leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was 3.8 times. Next, I’d like to make a few comments about our fee-based margin, hedging and capital spending programs for 2015. For the second quarter of 2015, our operating margin was 72% fee-based. For 2015, we now expect at least 70% of our operating margin to be fee-based. Since the end of the first quarter, we continue to layer on hedges using costless collars and swaps and for our current estimate of equity volumes from Field Gathering & Processing, we estimate we have now hedged approximately 70% of the remaining 2015 natural gas, approximately 60% of the remaining 2015 condensate and approximately 30% of remaining NGL volumes. For 2016, based on our estimate of our current equity volumes, we estimate that we have hedged approximately 45% of natural gas, approximately 35% of condensate and approximately 15% of NGL volumes. Moving on to capital spending. We continue to estimate approximately $700 million and $900 million of growth in capital expenditures in 2015, which includes ten months of CapEx related to the TPL systems. Next, I’ll make a few brief remarks about the results of Targa Resources Corp. Targa Resources Corp stand-alone distributable cash flow for the second quarter 2015 was $52 million and TRC declared approximately $49 million in dividends for the quarter, resulting in dividend coverage of approximately 1.1 times. On July 21, TRC declared a second quarter cash dividend of $0.875 per common share or $3.50 per common share on an annualized basis, representing approximately 27% increase over the annualized rate paid with respect to the second quarter of 2014. As of June 30, TRC had $460 million of outstanding borrowings and $210 million of availability under TRC’s $670 million senior secured credit facility and $160 million of outstanding borrowings under TRC’s senior secured term loan resulting in about 2.6 times debt compliance ratio. At TRC, we continue to expect 5% to 10% effective cash tax rate for 2015 and in the near term beyond 2015 and effective cash tax rate of less than 15%. That concludes my review and I’ll now turn the call back over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you, Matt. Five months have passed since we acquired TPL. We really like the assets, our people are working as one team and the target team is continuing to mine opportunities across our combined footprint. We are working on connecting West Tex and SAOU later this year, enhancing options for producer customers and allowing us to spend capital even more efficiently with West Tex, SAOU and Sandhills connected together in the Permian Basin. These interconnections, you will recall that we connected SAOU to Sandhills last year for buy more flexibility to meet customer needs and to access existing capacity for growth. Along with the connection of West Tex and SAOU, we may also restart the idled 45 million cubic feet per day Benedum Plant in Upton County. These projects do not require much capital. Given that we are operating at near capacity in the Permian Basin, the flexibility associated with connecting existing systems and existing plants and having an idled plant to restart is very valuable. We also expect to complete the Buffalo Plant in Martin County in 2016 with timing dependent on volume growth. We can have that plant completed and running in six months, six months after we make the decision with our joint venture partner, Pioneer Natural Resources to go ahead with the final stages of construction. Similarly, activity around our Versado system in the western part of the Permian Basin continues. We are adding another compressor station and lined a new 16-inch line to better access available capacity at our Monument Plant, serving additional volumes from the Delaware Basin to the Southwest. This is an example of capital spending that isn’t significant enough to be a single line item on our published CapEx projects, but it is a capital well spent given the returns associated with bringing new volumes to an existing plant that has available capacity. In the Badlands, we are making solid progress in securing right-of-way to lay pipe on reservation lands, which will allow us to secure volumes from wells that have already been drilled. Due to time required to move from right-of-way acquisition to approval to construction, this progress will likely not impact volumes until late this year or in 2016. Our little Missouri 3 plant came online in the first quarter and we’re continuing to see natural gas volumes increase to more than 50 million cubic feet per day in July. At the same time, crude oil volumes also ticked higher in July to more than 110,000 barrels per day. Given crude prices to-date, we have seen a significant decrease in rig activity in the broader Bakken and in the number of well permits filed in North Dakota. If you look at our systems across Mckenzie, Dunn and Montreal Counties, we’re positioned in one of the most active areas of the basin, as evidenced by the number of rigs running around our system relative to the rest of the basin. The right-of-way progress on the reservation is particularly important because it will allow us to lay previously delayed pipe and capture volumes that will support our system in 2016 and beyond. We’re now seven months through a roller coaster year related to prices for crude and NGLs, where in the second quarter alone, Mont Belvieu propane prices, for example, moved from a high of $0.58 per gallon in April to a low of $0.31 per gallon in June and we’re at about $0.36 per gallon as of yesterday. During such times of price volatility, interconnected flexible facilities including LPG storage can become increasingly valuable. We’re optimizing the use of our facilities for customer and target business mix. As domestic production has increased this year, we’ve seen continued demand for fractionation services. Construction on train pipe continues and it should be in service mid-2016. We’re also through the first public notice period related to our Train 6 permit with a similar size and scope as Trains 4 and Trains 5. We continue to work closely with Noble as they neared decision point on determining whether to move forward with a new terminal at Patriot, a condensate splitter at Channelview or some combination of both projects. Subject of final project scope and permitting, we would expect that the splitter or terminal or both projects would be operational in 2017. In closing, we have been operating in an uncertain environment and I’m incredibly proud of our execution across the Targa footprint in the second quarter. We cannot control commodity prices but our day-to-day focus is on safety, meeting customer needs, cost savings and efficiency of capital spending, without sacrificing customer service or ignoring low cost options, which may benefit Targa in the event of increased activity in the future. Continued execution across our well positioned diversified asset base has resulted in a strong first half for Targa. There is upside potential in the balance of the year, most obviously from the following. First, tailwinds associated with potential improvements in commodity prices from our current levels. Secondly, in the field, achieving volumes that are greater than expected from existing production, continued success competing for takeaway gas and efforts to continue to drive costs lower. And third, improving LPG export volumes and/or LPG export unit margins from our expected levels, perhaps as the market benefits from additional vessels coming online in the back half of the year. Targa’s strong execution performance in the first half of the year is driving quarter-over-quarter distribution and dividend growth, consistent with our expectations for the year and we will continue to execute in the second half of the year. With that, let’s open up the line for questions, operator.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Phillips of Clarkson. Your line is now open.
Matthew Phillips: [indiscernible].
Joe Bob Perkins: Hey, good morning.
Matthew Phillips: A quick question on the hedge book. You have an add-back on DCF of $24.8 million. I was wondering how that squares with the $17.1 million in gross margin on the commodity derivatives activity?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yeah, sure, good question. The $17.1 million in the other operating margin is essentially a legacy Targa or existing Targa hedge add-back. The TPL hedges in acquisition accounting were put on the book with fair value and so, as we collect those proceeds, it’s not hitting the income statement. So, we’re adding back the cash received in a quarter as those contracts settle. So, you’ll see that on a quarterly basis as we essentially receive the cash from the TPL hedge book.
Matthew Phillips: So, the TPL hedges are added back whereas the legacy Targa hedges are on the income statement?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yeah. They’re already in there. Yes.
Matthew Phillips: Okay. Great, thanks. And then moving on to LPG exports, you’ll add about 15% decline from 2Q - from 1Q and 2Q. However, looking at the vessel data, it looks like July was a record month for the U.S. Can you confirm if you’ve seen an uptick in July exports and what that might mean for margins?
Matt Meloy: We have seen some continued - I’d say seen some strong activity here thus far third quarter. As Joe Bob said, there were - we would the back half of the year to approximate Q2. Things might get a little bit better for us but that’s kind of what we’re seeing right now.
Matthew Phillips: Approximate to Q1 on a margin basis or both?
Matt Meloy: What we said was approximate Q2 for the back half of the year on a volume basis. I’d say, we’ve seen things a little bit stronger than we had in the previous few months, but we expect volumes to kind of approximate the second quarter.
Joe Bob Perkins: We also said that performing better than that was a potential upside and we said that our guidance continue to remain for the downstream to perhaps be modestly lower in 2015 than 2014. We like to outperform expectations.
Matthew Phillips: Yeah. Well, I mean margins from this have fallen off since 4Q, the past two quarters. But I mean, if volumes are coming back, I would think that might give you a little margin strength. Is that reasonable?
Joe Bob Perkins: I think we’ve kind of trying to relate it all.
Matthew Phillips: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And then the next question comes from Sunil Sibal of Global Hunter Securities. Your line is now open.
Sunil Sibal: Hi, good morning guys, and congrats on a good solid quarter.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, good morning.
Sunil Sibal: A couple of questions from me. In terms of the LPG export volumes that you saw second quarter, is it fair to assume they were all primarily contracted volumes or you had some spot volumes in there too?
Joe Bob Perkins: We haven’t given a detailed breakout of what is spot and what is contractive. I would say, we have seen as we’ve continued to over the previous quarters, a significant portion of our volumes loaded or contracted but we were able to load some shorter-term or spot cargos as well in the second quarter.
Sunil Sibal: And then on the hedge book for 2016, seems like on NGLs, you maintained your hedge positions from the first quarter. I was wondering if you could give us some - in terms of your thought process on that and what levels you feel comfortable hedging that ex-player?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yeah. We have layered on some hedges. In the first quarter, we layered on some hedges, in the second quarter, we actually layered on some additional hedges here early in the third quarter. We’ve added some costless collars, we’ve added some swaps for the various products, crude, NGLs and natural gas. In this environment, I don’t think we’re looking to kind of catch up to get back to those targeted levels all that once but we do continue to take a disciplined approach to try and continue to layer on some amount of hedges where it makes sense.
Sunil Sibal: Okay. And then lastly, some of your producer customers have been pretty vocal about economics of drilling even in the wake of this commodity price weakness. I was kind of curious does that jives activity levels you are seeing in your assets?
Joe Bob Perkins: We obviously read the same public statements and then we have communications that aren’t public. I would say that our broader knowledge is consistent with the public statements of our customer base and we even referenced in our comments that, for example, some producers intent to increase their activity levels at, for example, $60. We are encouraged by the activity levels to-date, but we are not very good at predicting prices.
Sunil Sibal: Okay, that’s very helpful and that’s all I had. Thanks guys.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Blossman of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Your line is now open.
Brandon Blossman: Good morning, guys.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning.
Brandon Blossman: Follow on to the gathering and processing throughput volume, so the comment was 3% to 5% up ‘15 over I believe Q4 ‘14.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes.
Brandon Blossman: Is that just producer - your current customer base’s volume increase or is there some presumption of market share - incremental market share grab there?
Joe Bob Perkins: The actuals achieved to-date have been both. We tend to be conservative about our projections going forward. I would like to believe that we continue to benefit from takeaway gas, but we haven’t overestimated that.
Brandon Blossman: Okay, fair enough. I will try the LPG export at slightly different angle here, is there anything in the back half of ‘15 into ‘16 that would point to your volume throughput being different than kind of the US in total numbers as we see those data - that data role out?
Joe Bob Perkins: I am not sure we’ve got a real good projection of forward US data. We’ve got a pretty handle on how our volumes are likely to behave and we’ve built that into our comments in the answers to the last question.
Brandon Blossman: Okay, fair enough. And then more discretely, on a per unit basis, GMP OpEx looks like it’s trending down very nicely over the last two or three quarters. What should we expect as far again on a per unit basis the trajectory through the back half of ‘15 on that metric?
Matt Meloy: We are going to continue to work on maintaining the cost reductions that we’ve achieved and realizing additional cost reductions. I don’t have a prediction for you in terms of a percent trend, but the efforts are going to continue and our people are very focused on it.
Brandon Blossman: So, flat to down is a fair takeaway there?
Matt Meloy: We are pleased with the downward trend that we can see from our internal numbers and that are harder for you all to see from reported numbers despite increases in volumes and that’s pretty extraordinary in the gathering and processing patched. And with expected continued growth for 2015 in those important areas we still expect to do so without increasing our cost.
Brandon Blossman: Okay, awesome. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darren Horowitz of Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Darren Horowitz: Joe Bob, couple of quick questions on field GMP and I appreciate the comments around the plus 3% to 5% overall volume growth even that of what’s going on in North Texas, but what I am more concerned about is the margin expectation to the extent that you can comment, I am just trying to get a feel for the lower operating expense, expected to continue through the back of this year. With the regard to the aggregate impact on gross operating profit for field GMP, how much lower or what’s the variability in terms of your back half of ‘15 margin versus what you’ve already experienced in the first half of ‘15?
Joe Bob Perkins: As we look second half versus first half, we expect to achieve similar or better. I think that’s about as precise as I can be.
Darren Horowitz: Okay. Let me jump over to North Texas, specifically the amount from a contractual perspective, POP contracts, I think previously you had said it’s somewhere around 30% of the 2015 margin was going to be POP and a lot of that was really around North Texas. I am just curious, now that you’ve got half of the year behind you and you are looking forward with the TPL assets, what’s that level of expectation for POP exposure in the back half of this year and then into ‘16? And from a re-contracting perspective as maybe you think about shifting some of that exposure to a more fee-based composition of cash flow, how do you think about the margin degradation maybe being offset by volume improvement or cash flow security?
Matt Meloy: Hey, Darren, it’s Matt. I want to talk just about North Texas just to clear one thing up there first. The North Texas is a POP business up there, so we do have some fees kind of embedded in those contracts whether it’s gathering or compression or others, but we think of North Texas as POP and we don’t really see that changing as we come back of this year and into 2016.
Darren Horowitz: Okay. And then last question from me and Joe Bob, again I appreciate it being difficult to predict crude oil prices, we struggle from the affliction. But I am wondering just with regard to the balanced assets McKinsey down in Montrose counties right, like a lot of that hinges not just on the absolute price but on the discount to TI, because I think that’s probably where the greater challenge is. So what are producers telling you just from a net back perspective in terms of where the cash price gets more economic?
Joe Bob Perkins: As opposed to me describing what producers are telling me and not telling the public, what I can see is activity at the price levels that we’ve seen since the first of the year and that activity as you know isn’t driven by the spot price in the particular month, but their outlook for those prices. It’s one of the best oil basins in the world. The differentials as a percentage have moved around since the first of the year.
Darren Horowitz: Thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: That’s about as best we can describe. And like we said, we have several reasons in the Bakken to be optimistic about volumes even at low North Dakota activity levels. The activity levels around our system are better and given the activity levels around our system, we still have some backlog of volumes that we are going to be getting to, thanks to progress on right of way on the reservation. That’s going to take us a little while and thanks to the progress at the Little Missouri 3. The Little Missouri 3 plant provided for helping to put out players and meet customer needs of gas production that was already there and not being captured.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of TJ Schultz with RBC Capital. Your line is now open.
TJ Schultz: Hey, good morning.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning.
TJ Schultz: On field GMP volumes, I guess just questions on 2016, I think the optimistic outlook that you guys kind of commented in the remarks, is that just a fact that you are likely to have a better beginning level or is there something specific maybe you guys gleaned here more recently with the swing and grew to 60 and now back down that gives you more optimism maybe about producer activity kind of within this oil range that we have been bouncing around?
Joe Bob Perkins: Our feeling a bit better about it has to be in the context of lot of those things you just mentioned, but it wasn’t kind of the short term movement in prices. Number one and the primary reason is volumes have performed better than we expected despite prices over the first half of the year. If you took our last quarter call, for example, spot prices and forward prices are lower than our last quarter call, but given those prices, the volumes have exceeded our expectation. So the volume to price relationship is important in our feeling a bit better. And then, yes, the US data around supply and demand and a break over on crude volumes which occurred a little later than we thought it would, I think works into the mix as you referenced. But that primary thing and we try to say it as we feel a bit better because volumes have done a bit better in spite of pricing.
TJ Schultz: Okay, thanks. On exports, I think you said you are adding contracts, just any color on the appetite for short term versus long term contracts and then also just any update on constraints that ship availability is having for you guys through the rest of the year?
Joe Bob Perkins: We’ve guided both since our last call. We are more contracted than not contracted in the near term. We know that ship constraints are a factor. Our ability to predict exactly how fast those additional ships come on or where they come on is not as good as other analysts out there, but we know our customers have felt the ship constraints. We sort of gave you an expectation and then also pointed to it as a potential upside relative to our overall expectations.
TJ Schultz: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Jeremy Tonet: Good morning.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning.
Jeremy Tonet: Congratulations on the good quarter there. Just I had a question on the TPL hedge book. It came in a bit stronger than what we were anticipating. So just want to see if you have static commodity price environment, whether the pace of cash gains is going to be stable through ‘15 or if it is more front half of the year weighted.
Matt Meloy: So we will be filing the Q here shortly and it will have an update of all the hedges that we have on, so it really depends on your commodity price expectation for the amount of cash that we will receive in any quarter.
Jeremy Tonet: Exactly, I was just curious if there was - the contracts were more weighted to the first half versus back half for the TPL hedges you picked up?
Matt Meloy: Yeah, we will have less amount hedged and at lower prices kind of generally as we go through time. So I think that’s a fair assessment.
Jeremy Tonet: Got you. I appreciate that. And Joe Bob, want to touch on some of the things you are seeing before I know it’s a very difficult question, but I am just wondering system-wide, if you are looking at the futures curve, is there a number in your mind where you feel good about continued growth? Is 16, is that 50 versus 60, is there any goal posts you could give us there as far as how you think the target assets would react in when you’d see growth?
Joe Bob Perkins: Well, I wish I was that smart. I think I kind of admitted already that our first of year expectations, volume connected to price, volume was a little better than the price connection. I don’t have a magic milestone or goal posts for you out there.
Jeremy Tonet: Fair enough. Just one last one from me. As far the Noble payments around the splitter, I was just wondering for modeling purposes does that stop at a period of time, should we be taking that into consideration.
Matt Meloy: Yeah, it stops in the third quarter, partly through the third quarter.
Jeremy Tonet: Got you. And is there anything material that we should know just so we don’t overestimate there?
Matt Meloy: Yeah, good question. We haven’t’ given the specific number, so it’s going to be tough for you to triangulate. I will just say it’s not large enough so we had to disclose it as a dollar amount variance
Joe Bob Perkins: And we only disclose what we have to disclose as we put that out when we first - recognize we have confidentially - we’ve first of all good relationship with Noble and we have confidentiality requirements. Those confidentiality requirements say we disclose what we have to report and we spend a lot of time with accountants to make sure we got that right.
Jeremy Tonet: Fair enough. Makes sense. Thank you for the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Schneur Gershuni of UBS. Your line is now open.
Schneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning, guys. I was wondering if we can expand on the integration process with Atlas a little bit. It sort of sounded like if I heard correctly that you might be seeing some very large capital efficiencies. I believe you said at one point that you’ve got a plant that you can start up and connect and so forth. I was wondering if you can sort of lay that out for us as to how that could possibly impact margins on a go-forward basis. Is there lot more opportunities like this where you can have capital efficiencies or I guess capital avoidance and start pickup volumes? Does your margins further expand with capacity utilization picking up? I was just sort of wondering if you can sort of expand on that a little bit for us.
Matt Meloy: I certainly understand the question. Five months have passed since we did the acquisition. Assets are terrific, particularly in the Permian Basin mix terrifically with our existing assets. People are working as one team, one target team for target bottom line. We did sort of give early conservative synergies to you all which makes you want more and I understand that. You’d like more detail, you’d liked the variance analysis against the plans. What’s really going on is we want to have a separate report of the progress on those synergies instead, the way we are managing it, the way we are working it, as those become embedded in our results. It’s one of the ways we’ve kind of outperformed our expectations and it will continue to be. You pointed to a couple of the factors and we alluded to them. When you combine those systems, you have capital efficiency opportunities, you have the opportunity that we’ve always had but even more so of getting gas to available capacity and we started up idle plants throughout our whole history, it’s just another opportunity to do so for the benefit of the combined system. Hope that’s helpful but I also know it’s not exactly what you wanted.
Schneur Gershuni: Maybe I’ll ask this a little differently. Classic analyst question, ex-commodity impacts, I mean the commodity is going to move up and down and so forth, but should we expect the IRR on capital deployed at least over the next six to nine months to be significantly higher than it has been in the past or so differently, should we see ex-commodity impact margins improve just as you’re able to take advantage of these capital opportunities, is that a fair way to be looking at it?
Joe Bob Perkins: I understand that question and it’s an easier question to address than the question from like last quarter, are your IRRs going to go down in this environment. In reality, when we’re working hard in this environment doing a lot of smaller projects taking advantage of the low hanging fruit, benefiting from takeaway gas with small expenditures, those returns are very attractive, okay, they’re very attractive, they need smaller dollar amount and that’s showing up in our bottom line. I like expanding on the answer to your question because it works against kind of hypothesis which is not, we’re not seeing as the case that our returns are going to go down. We may not be spending this larger chucks of dollars, which is good and proper in this environment to takes those and defer them until needed but the dollars we’re spending are getting attractive returns and I think that flows to our bottom line.
Schneur Gershuni: Okay, now that’s actually a great answer. As a follow-up to all the questions about your positive outlook with respect to the Permian, I think you started off by saying hey; we were surprised on the volume side, so therefore we’re sort of carrying it through and so forth. I was wondering if maybe you can expand a little bit as to why the volumes are outperforming expectations. Is it producers using better completions, are they targeting better wells or they’re drilling more wells than you initially thought and I was just wondering if you can sort of carry that through as to why the volumes have actually been performing better or not, if that’s a bad thing and as to why that will continue to be the case over the next six to nine months.
Joe Bob Perkins: First of all, kind of the last factor, it’s not because they’re drilling more wells than we thought, not appreciably to any extent. But it is a combination of some of the factors you mentioned and some others. I would start with their drilling with a more limited budget in the best spots and their technology has improved such that the best spots are more productive than they have been in the past. And those best spots are where our systems are and that to a great extent and that’s the reason for us having underestimated it. Maybe we’re too conservative, I’m not terribly surprised but it is a pleasant surprise on the margin for the volumes to be outperforming where the prices have been. Secondly, we have been successful because we are working hard, willing to selectively spent capital and have a very good reputation with customers out there that we’re winning packages of gas that are coming up for renegotiation on the margin. And strong competitors do that during tough times, those two factors maybe a little bit of when you have a little less activity and you’ve been working to catch up all along and get pressures down where you want them to be in the field that benefits our customers and it benefits us on volumes. Those are kind of the three areas that are in my head and it’s not because drilling was a lot higher.
Schneur Gershuni: So weaker competitors with poor balance sheets are basically at disadvantage, right relative to somebody like yourself, is that a fair way to think about the volume or market share comment.
Joe Bob Perkins: I think I had put it a little softer than that. It’s not just the balance sheet; it’s also the reputation for customer service.
Schneur Gershuni: Okay, great. Alright thank you very much, I really appreciate all the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Michael Blum: Hi, thanks, I’ll try to be brief here. Just curious for what you’re seeing from the impact of ethane rejection, is there has been any change in the way you’re running your plants?
Joe Bob Perkins: For running our plants, we’ve looked at that every day and we’re doing more not less ethane rejection where we can.
Michael Blum: Would you say that’s from what you see out there from other volumes that are coming to your system, is that sort of consistent?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, broadly so. We see a lot of pipelines as you know coming into our CBF fractionation facility. And certainly across the board you would characterize it as getting lower on ethane content meaning that more ethane is being rejected.
Michael Blum: Okay, great. And then, you gave some pretty good updates on the various projects that you have in the backlog or the potential backlog. So it is fair for me to just take away from that that effectively you’re still seeing pretty good demand for incremental projects, we haven’t seen any really material change which I think is something that a lot of people are thinking about.
Joe Bob Perkins: Our backlog is a list of those defined projects that people have seen in the permitting process or customers have talked about us working on for the most part. There is not a decrease demand for any of them, as we said really back to the first year; it’s a matter of when not if for almost all those projects. Increasing NGLs coming into Mont Belvieu continue, they’re coming a little bit slower than we might have expected in the early part of 2014 but demand is still there back to that, when, not if.
Michael Blum: And then, Matt I apologize if I had missed it, because I was writing quickly. Can you just repeat what was the Q2 ATM equity issuance?
Matt Meloy: Yeah, I said that in the script, I think it was $263 million and that also includes July, which I think I’d - it will be in our queue as a subsequent of that about $23 million or something.
Michael Blum: Okay, great. Thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: That includes the GP stuff?
Matt Meloy: That was ATM, so the GP amount is a separate number we gave, which we also put in the queue. That’s why my number was so high.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Edwards of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Edwards: Yeah thanks for taking my questions. Back to the LPG export, just asking it a different way, I think you said there was a mix of spot and contracted, would it be fair to say the majority is contracted.
Joe Bob Perkins: [indiscernible] setting a record, I’m trying to drill down on that. I know that some of our competitors may give more details than we do on our export volumes and our mix of contracts, but we’re really making a competitive decision on how much we want to say for the good of our unit holders and the good of our shareholders. So I appreciate you drilling down but --.
John Edwards: Okay. Fair enough.
Joe Bob Perkins: If the mix is correct, there is a mix. Yes.
Matt Meloy: The thing I wanted to make sure we take away, as we have said the majority of our volumes are on contracted volumes, because I don’t want you to take away that the majority is short term or spot con.
Joe Bob Perkins: Sounded to me like we’re trying to figure out, if on the increment that was added what was the percentage of increment.
John Edwards: No, no, no, okay. Alright fair enough. And then just kind of extending some of the earlier questions asked but you have expressed optimism in 2016 based on the volumes that have materialized so far and I was just curious to what extend pricing might impact that optimism. If we stay in this sort of sustained price environment that we’re currently in rather than the improvement that a lot of people are calling for, I’m just wondering, how would that temper your optimism if at all, I mean, as perhaps people are responding to things based on price expectations going forward not the current sloppy environment that we’re in.
Joe Bob Perkins: Our feeling a bit better about the volume outlet for the remainder for the year and for 2016 is not based on looking at a single case or a single - it’s based on us looking at multiple forecasts related to multiple pricing and what we think is likely. The most important thing that we are communicating is that our volumes and our volume outlook at whatever price scenario we’re looking at has done better, it did better against the actuals, which actually were lower prices than we expected and going forward in price environment that’s flat for today, are volume feeling would be better than it was at the beginning of the year for that same price outlook. And if you get to the higher price outlooks, would have volumes greater than we expected for higher price outlooks. Does that make sense to you? Otherwise we’re trying to predict the prices and I’m not trying to predict the prices.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. Congratulations on a good quarter in a tough market. If we could just continue on the volume question for just one second if I could because I haven’t pretty kind of addressed this and I understand your cautious outlook on volumes and you’re pleased with the way things came in but in terms of just a forward look, anyway to talk about what the weather impact for this quarter in terms of your volumes?
Joe Bob Perkins: This quarter’s weather impact was primarily a North Texas and we pointed to it because it was a fact in some of the producers in the area have pointed to it. It’s difficult to extract, we might have been flat quarter-to-quarter in North Texas if it weren’t for the weather impact, I don’t know that for a fact, I do know that I project where we are and where we’re going and it was appropriate to signal that unless there is some bump due to price, North Texas is likely to continue to decline not dramatically but continue to decline. When we said weather impact, it was not just the flood, it was the impact post flood on electricity connections even some washed out pipelines that took a while to repair primarily on the electricity side because they just didn’t have the cruise to take care of everything it wants and some of them more remote locations didn’t get taken care for a quite a while.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you very much. On the terminaling and storage fees, there was some incremental, is there more to be reprised or is there any additional color you can give there?
Matt Meloy: I think that comment Joe Bob referred to is just an environment where you have some contango in the forward curves, as storage becomes worth more and there are some opportunities for additional income.
Unidentified Analyst: And then the last one from me, on your coastal plants, is there any outlook for idling any more plants there or shall we assume that’s done?
Joe Bob Perkins: The consolidation of the coastal straddle has been going for in many ways much of our career. We’ve said before that Target is well positioned to benefit from those consolidations. We have one of the strongest positions we like to call it a catcher’s mitt and as less efficient plants are idled we tend to capture a lot more than our share of the remaining gas and I just want to credit the people working the coastal gathering and processing for figuring out ways to save dollars make more money with less volumes get richer gas when it’s available and the producers are working to get richer gas. It’s a small part of our operating margin but boy did they work hard to keep that small part as high as possible.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Faisel Khan of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Faisel Khan: Thanks its Faisel from Citigroup. Just a few questions from your press release, the condensate pricing were different quite substantially from field gathering from the coastal gathering systems and that difference was sort of wider in the quarter versus last quarter and even on a percentage basis versus last year. Can you kind of discuss what’s going on there, is that a quality differential, is that sort of a real transportation differential, it just seems a little bit wide even looking at WTI versus LLS [ph]?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yeah. Coastal is usually different than the field, it gets priced more of LLS, so if you look at the differentials from where we’re picking up that coastal of a field relative to the LLS which is typically a track closer to Brent. So it’s just those various differentials, I will say that the condensate does not have a big impact on our operating margins. So it’s not something that we focus a lot on. But it is due to this impact.
Matt Meloy: And occasionally there are quality differentials that might impact a single quarter. It’s - we market it the best we can, relative to supply and demand in the localized markets.
Faisel Khan: I’m just - because the differential has obviously narrowed in the quarter, so I just want to understand if maybe there is a constraint there, in the, I guess your field gathering system?
Joe Bob Perkins: No. I don’t have. I think we’re more talking about market dynamics than anything.
Faisel Khan: Okay. Fair enough. And then in your press release, you guys mentioned that the fractionation results were sort of impacted by lower system product gains, can you discuss exactly what that means, is that just you talking about rejecting ethane or you’re talking about sort of
Joe Bob Perkins: It really has more to do with our Mont Belvieu complex and volumes going through our fractionators. There are opportunities to blend the various products at the back of our fractionators before we sell those spec products to market, so there are pluses and minuses throughout the system and those amounts vary from quarter-to-quarter.
Faisel Khan: Okay. And then also you guys discuss in your results also lower refinery LPG supply, I would have thought with refiners sort of running all out in the quarter that LPG supply would have been up over the quarter, but because you’re talking about it being down, I didn’t sort of understand that dynamic too?
Joe Bob Perkins: I understand directionally what you’re describing, but what we always see in practice is about the time we think we’re going to be getting higher supplies from refineries, we don’t. It is pretty difficult to predict what we’re really good doing as managing it in the short term to do the best with what we get. There were some refining downtimes on the west coast, don’t really want to point or pick at any particular customer, but that shows up in our overall results.
Faisel Khan: Okay. So did you guys have access to the California refining LPG?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yeah. Some of those are our customers and what we also know on the margin is that not just pointing to West Coast, some refinery customers have actually used some of those products as fuel on the margin. So it’s a difficult trend to track, but we are as very opportunistic in adding that refinery services business to the overall propane wholesale marketing business.
Faisel Khan: Okay. And then last question from me, on your hedges, just want to make sure, is there a lag effect from the hedges or is it, as you guys show the volumes in the quarter, those volumes sort of are represented through your hedge contracts, I mean there is no difference from quarter to quarter, how to recognize that?
Joe Bob Perkins: No, there is no lag. The cash comes in for the month that we’ve had, we’ll recognize that as either income or we’ll put it as an addback in the cash flow statements to the extent the cash is received.
Faisel Khan: Okay, makes sense. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Sighinolfi of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Corey Goldman: Hey, guys. Corey Goldman for Chris. Just a quick question, sorry to go back to Noble really quick, what is the threshold, I had a curiosity for what you have to disclose?
Joe Bob Perkins: Sorry. Good try. I understand the question. I can’t answer, and by the way, absent the Noble contract, I’m not sure that I would get a concrete answer from our internal accountants or auditors anyway, they sort of know it when they get there and at some point, we say okay, I think I understand and we report accordingly.
Corey Goldman: Got it. And I guess just to dovetail in that, I’m assuming because you’re recognizing revenue before any things in the ground yet, do you assume the projects that go, just had a curiosity, what would be the impact to you guys positive or negative, if the project is a no go?
Joe Bob Perkins: I’m not prepared to discuss that either. What we said when we announced the deal is that relative to the original channel view splitter agreement, we were not economically disadvantaged by renegotiating the agreements and that’s all I can say.
Corey Goldman: Okay. That’s helpful. And then just the last question for me, and I apologize if I misunderstood what you said, I think you said with respect to contracts, you’re more contracted than non-contracted in the near term, that implies let’s call 3.25 between, just wondering how you compare that what you said last quarter about more than 4.2 million, is it 1 million barrels a month for ‘15 and then around 4.2 million a month in ‘16?
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay. Just to be clear, we didn’t say, we said more which is greater than half, so we’re not saying we’re more or less in that previous number that we gave, we just said we’re not going to kind of get in to the dialing in the exact amount that we’re contracted in the exact amount of spot. So I wouldn’t read from that that we’re less.
Corey Goldman: Okay. So you can’t reiterate if you’re in line with the 4.2 million about a month in 15?
Joe Bob Perkins: Oh, I could but I’m not going to.
Corey Goldman: Okay. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Brody of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Gregg Brody: Hi guys. Just a quick one for you. I think you mentioned when you gave your hedge numbers for the NGLs that you were 80% hedged in ‘16, versus 30% for the rest of this year, did I hear that right and if I did, what’s the…?
Joe Bob Perkins: No, we’re not 80% hedged, I think for ‘16 for NGLs, I think I said 15%.
Gregg Brody: 15, then that would explain what I misheard, that’s perfect. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] of Citadel. Your line is now open.
Jeff Mccarter: Hey, guys. This is Jeff Mccarter with Citadel. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the point you made about transitioning packages of gas, what basins are you seeing those in and were there further opportunities?
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay. You may have interpreted transitioning from a term I used as takeaway, kind of going back, mostly, we’re finding volume increases from our dedicated contracts with existing producers and those volumes were better than we thought in our important basins, battling on the entire Permian basin. West, south, surprised us to the positive. Particularly those large Permian basin positions in bad lands are coming from our existing acreage, but across the board, we’ve also been successful and that’s a complement to our people of winning a whole lot more, many, many more deals and much, much more volume on takeaway than we have lost, takeaway being a contract came up for renewal with someone else and we got it. Now, that’s on the margin, it’s a positive on the margin. It’s part of the positive surprise, but I don’t have more information to provide you other than to say we track it by deal and track it by volume and report back to our board and the wins are a whole lot better than the losses. But mostly, the positive volume surprised us from our existing contracts and our existing dedications.
Jeff Mccarter: Okay. So no real color that you can offer on, is that part of what drove the Eagle Ford volumes or is it producers shifting to different processors in the Permian, nothing more you can offer?
Joe Bob Perkins: I will say that my win loss ratio on volumes or deals is weighed to the target side on every basin.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ethan Bellamy of Baird. Your line is now open.
Ethan Bellamy: Bob, how would you handicap the potential for elimination of the crude oil export band and if that occurred, what would that be to your strategy?
Joe Bob Perkins: Everybody frowned at me, because they were afraid I would start talking.
Ethan Bellamy: I’d love to hear you do that.
Joe Bob Perkins: I won’t, I don’t handicap anything moving fast in Washington if it were to happen, we’re always trying to help as a midstream player. Everybody just did a big sigh of relief, I think that’s as much as I can dig in to.
Ethan Bellamy: So just to follow up there, how does that potential outcome factor in to your risk analysis on things like the condensate infrastructure and the agreement with Noble?
Joe Bob Perkins: That question, I can’t address. Recognizing even with export bands or opening up condensate, you still have needs for particular assets. Student body won’t go right or left based on a change in the law and our customers with their contracts and their portfolio of opportunities will decide whether those investments continue to make sense. That’s what we’ll respond to. And absent near term moves in Congress, that’s impacting people’s longer term outlook about assets. Even with the opening of selected condensate exports, you continue to need splitters on the US Gulf Coast to some extent within refineries, outside refineries, whereas going to splitters on the other side of the water. Where is the best place to be importing products, and moving it around, that’s a global, it’s a global market with lots of solutions.
Ethan Bellamy: Thanks so much. I guess I’m asking the right questions if you tell me no.
Joe Bob Perkins: I’m going to get a bad reputation. I’ve really tried to answer all the questions. We can only answer some of them so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Charles Marshall of Capital One Securities. Your line is now open.
Charles Marshall: Two quick follow-up on your opening comments regarding distribution growth for the year, expected to come in at the lower end of the range, given your sort of better expectations on the back half of the year and field GMP volumes, et cetera, is your guidance range at the low-end, that includes your updated forecast for the remainder of the year or could that slide more to the right on the higher end of the range.
Matt Meloy: NO, we took in to consideration both our outlook in the field and our logistics and marketing business in to that 4 to 7% and then towards the lower end of that, we’re also part way through the year, we had a distribution increase of a penny in the first quarter, and then half a penny in the second. So then, we’re part way through the year, so we have a better handle on just kind of how the average is going to shake out.
Joe Bob Perkins: And we try to drive it smoothly.
Charles Marshall: Okay. I appreciate that. One last quick one. Regarding potential ethane export projects, is there any update there you can provide for us?
Joe Bob Perkins: No update.
Charles Marshall: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And I’m showing no further questions at this time. I’d like to hand the call back over to Joe Bob Perkins for any closing remarks.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you, operator. Thank you everybody for your patience and your interest and to the extent you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact Jim, Matt or any of us. Good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. That does conclude today’s program. You may all disconnect. Have a great day everyone.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Targa Resources’ First Quarter 2015 Earnings Webcast and Presentation. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator instructions] I would now like to introduce the host for todays’ conference call Miss Jennifer Kneale. You may begin Ma’am.
Jennifer Kneale: Thank you, Kevin. I'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2015 investor call for both Targa Resources Corp. and Targa Resources Partners LP. Before we get started, I would like to mention that Targa Resources Corp., TRC, or the Company and Targa Resources Partners LP, Targa Resources Partners or the Partnership, have published their joint earnings release, which is available on our website www.targaresources.com. We will also be posting an updated investor presentation to the website later today. I would like to remind you that any statements made during this call that might include the Company’s or the Partnership’s expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Please note that actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings, including the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Speaking on the call today will be Joe Bob Perkins, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Meloy, Chief Financial Officer. Joe Bob will start off with a high level review of performance and highlights. He will then it over to Matt to review the partnerships consolidated financial results, segments results and other financial matters. Matt will also review key financial matters related to Targa Resources Corp. Following Matt’s comments Joe Bob will provide some concluding remarks and then we will take your questions. There are also several other members of the management team available who may assist in the Q&A session. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe Bob Perkins.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Jen. Good morning to everyone. Before we turn to Targa’s first quarter results, I’d like to remind Jen that we closed the acquisition of Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P and Atlas Energy L.P. on February 27. Atlas Pipeline Partners is now Targa Pipeline Partners or TPL. And we are still training ourselves to use the appropriate name and acronym internally and externally. Given the end of February effective close, our first quarter reported financials include one month of contributions from TPL, but we will also provide on this call some pro forma full quarter data points. In many ways pro forma full quarter adjusted EBITDA, full quarter adjusted distributable cash flow and full quarter coverage or more representatives for the combined entity. Under the terms of the merger agreement, net cash from operations did not leave the Targa Pipeline Partner System prior to closing except for things like first quarter distributions and onetime merger related expenses. And therefore, what we are calling pro forma full quarter adjusted EBITDA DCF [ph] and coverage or more representative of the combined business performance. We will carefully label such pro forma numbers when we refer to them this morning. So let’s dive into results and highlights. Our reported first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $258 million as compared to $234 million for the first quarter of last year. The Logistics asset segment produced quarterly reported operating margin of $125 million up 30% compared to last year, primarily driven by partial recognition of the renegotiated commercial arrangements related to our condensate splitter project with Noble, which we have discussed before plus higher LPG exports as we benefitted from a full quarter contribution from the fully completed second phase of our LPG export facility. In the Field Gathering and Processing segment reported operating margin was $79 million, a decrease of 16% versus the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to significantly lower commodity prices offset by the inclusion of one month of results from TPL and by increased volumes from almost all other business units. I would add that pro forma all TPL business units’ also experienced higher volumes over last year. Now pro forma distributable cash flow which includes contribution from TPL for the full quarter and includes deducts from the full quarter TPL interest and maintenance expense that pro forma distributable cash flow of $228 million resulted in pro forma quarterly distribution coverage of approximately 1.2 times, based on our first quarter declared distribution of $0.82 or $3.28 on an annual basis. Pro forma full quarter adjusted EBITDA excluding someone items was $314 million with a $126 million of pro forma operating margin coming from a Field G&P segment. As I said, we believe the pro forma estimates are very representative for the combined entity. Compared to the first quarter of 2014, the partnerships first quarter distribution represents an 8% increase. At the TRC level, compared to the first quarter of 2014 the first quarter dividend of $0.83 or $3.32 annualized represents a 28% increase. Now as part of the Atlas mergers we amended our partnership agreement to reallocate certain IDR cash flow from the general partner pro rata to the limited partners. For the first quarter, the announced distribution includes the $9.375 IDR Giveback transfer which reallocates that $9.375 million of IDR cash flow from the GP pro rata to the LP unit holders. When we announced our first quarter 2015 distributions and dividends, we also provided a revised outlook for 2015. Given the continued uncertainty around producer activity and a lower commodity price environment we have certainly reviewed multiple forecast, multiple inputs and outcomes and of course consistent with how we always approach dividend and distribution declarations we have run multiple, multiyear commodity price and volume scenarios, including flat price cases, strip price cases and cases with other price forecast along with our best attempts to understand producer activity and volume expectations across each of those price outlooks and we continue to do that analysis. With that ongoing analysis, we provided a likely range for selected dimensions of our revised outlook. We said that we currently believe that Field Gathering and Processing Operations would likely have a flat to low single digit 2015 average volume growth compared to the first quarter 2014 volumes. Now, with the publication of this quarter I can provide you a little more information on our Field G&P Volumes. I just said that volumes were up for Q1 2015 versus Q1 2014 for essentially all of our Field Gathering and Processing Business Units. Also, total Field G&P Volumes in Q1 2015 were higher than Q4, 2014, but were lower in several of our Field Systems due to cold weather and related freeze-offs. I am happy to say that current total Field G&P volumes are higher than the first quarter and that essentially all of our systems across the combined companies are higher than the first quarter at today’s current volumes. And all, I repeat all of our Texas and Permian Basin business units are up on current volumes versus the first quarter, so that’s good news. We also said that the logistics and marketing 2015 operating margin may be modestly lower than the 2014 operating margin. In the first quarter of 2015, we exported approximately 5.8 million barrels per month of LPGs. We currently continue to see interest in long term contracts for LPGs but given the current market dynamics expected activity in 2015 maybe lower and lower than the back half of 2014 activity, also with lower fee margins than the back half of 2014. We exported less volume in the first quarter of 2015 versus the fourth quarter of 2014, impacted by more challenging market dynamics including international price pressures, this [ph] used with ship availability and high vessel freight cost impacting our customers and other international buyers. So the overall result of our analysis for the Targa businesses in 2015 is a range of expectations of 4% to 7% distribution growth at TRP in 2015 relative to 2014. That range of distribution growth with approximately a one times coverage. At TRC, we therefore expect 25% plus of dividend growth in 2015 over 2014 with approximately one times coverage. Underneath that TRC expectation we expect an effective cash tax rate of 5% to 10% for 2015 and going forward at TRC, we will continue to benefit from depreciation associated with Atlas mergers and expect an annual effective cash rate less than 15% in the near term beyond 2015. That wraps up my initial comments and now I hand it over to Matt.
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Joe Bob. I'd like to add my welcome and thank you for joining our call today. As mentioned, reported adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $258 million compared to $234 million for the same period last year. The increase was driven by the addition of TPL, higher gathering and processing volumes, partial recognition of our renegotiated commercial arrangements related to our condensate splitter project with Noble and higher LPG exports, offset by significantly lower commodity prices. Overall, reported operating margin increased 9% for the first quarter compared to the first quarter last year. I will review the drivers of this performance in the segment reviews. Reported net maintenance capital expenditures were $20 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $14 million in the first quarter of 2014. Included in the revised outlook for 2015 provided in April was an expectation for $110 million of reported net maintenance CapEx in 2015 which includes 10 months of maintenance CapEX related to the TPL systems. Turning to the segment level, I’ll summarize the first quarter's performance on a year-over-year basis, starting with the Logistics and Marketing division, first quarter reported operating margin increased 19% compared to the first quarter of 2014 driven by partial recognition of our renegotiated commercial contract arrangements related to our condensate splitter project at Noble and higher LPG and fractionation activity. For the quarter we loaded an average of 5.8 million barrels per month of LPG exports compared to 3.5 million barrels per month during the first quarter of 2014. Fractionation volumes increased by 9% in the first quarter of 2015 versus the same time period last year. Turning to the Gathering and Processing division, reported operating margin decreased by 28% compared to last year primarily due to significantly lower commodity prices, partially offset by one month of contribution from TPL and by volumes increases at essentially all of our Field G&P business units. First quarter reported 2015 natural gas plant inlet volumes for the Field Gathering and Processing segment were 1,488 million cubic feet per day an increase of over 74% compared to the same period in 2014. We benefitted from the inclusion of one month of TPL volumes and growth at essentially all of our Field G&P business units. The overall increase in natural gas inlet volumes was also due to the addition of the 200 million cubic feet per day High Plains Plant in SAOU in the Permian Basin in the 200 million cubic feet per day Longhorn Plant in North Texas, both of which were completed in the second quarter of 2014, plus the addition of our 40 million cubic feet per day Little Missouri 3 plant in our Badlands operations in North Dakota that was placed in service during the first quarter. Crude oil gathered increased to 101,000 barrels per day in the first quarter, a 35% increase versus the same time period last year, as a result of producer activities. Let’s now move briefly to capital structure and liquidity. We were very active in the capital markets in the first quarter utilizing the debt in equity market successfully across our capital structure to maintain our strong liquidity position. As of March 31st, we had 840 million of outstanding borrowings under the Partnership's 1.6 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due 2017. With outstanding letters of credit of 25 million, availability quarter end was 735 million. At quarter end we had borrowings of 198 million under accounts receivable securitization facility. From January through April 2015 we received gross proceeds of approximately 200 million from equity issuances including general partner contributions and 155 million of net proceeds under our at the market equity program which allows us to sell equity at prevailing market prices. On a debt compliance basis which provides us adjusted EBITDA credit per material growth projects that are in process but not yet complete, and makes other adjustments, TRPs total leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was 3.5 times. Next, I’d like to make a few comments about our fee based margin, hedging and capital spending programs for the year. For the first quarter of 2014, our operating margin was 76% fee based. We continue to expect operating margin to be at least 65% to 70% fee based during 2015. Since our fourth quarter earnings call in mid February we have entered into some additional hedge contracts including costless collars. For non-fee based operating margin, relative to the partnerships current estimate of equity volumes from Field G&P we estimate that we have hedged approximately 65% of remaining 2015 natural gas, 60% of the remaining 2015 condensate and approximately 30% of remaining 2015 NGL volumes. For 2016, we estimate that we have hedged approximately 35% of natural gas, 30% of condensate and approximately 15% of NGL volumes. Moving onto capital spending, we estimate approximately 700 million to 900 million of reported growth capital expenditures in 2015. This includes 10 months of CapEx spending for TPL. Next, I’d like to make a few brief remarks about the results of Targa Resources Corp. Targa Resources Corp standalone distributable cash flow for the first quarter was $52 million and TRC declared approximately 47 million in dividends for the quarter resulting in dividend coverage of approximately 1.1 times. On April 21, TRC declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.83 per common share or $3.32 per common share on an annualized basis, representing an approximately 28% increase over the first quarter of 2014. On March 12th, we priced at successful underwritten public offering of 3.25 million shares of TRC common stock an additional 487, 500 shares of TRC common stock repurchased through the exercise of the green shoot resulting in total gross proceeds of approximately $340 million. As of March 31, we had 460 million of outstanding borrowings and 210 million of availability under TRCs 670 million senior secured revolving credit facility and 242 million of outstanding borrowings under TRCs senior secured term loan due 2022 resulting in a 2.7 times debt compliance ratio. As mentioned by Joe Bob earlier, we expect a 5% to 10% effective cash tax rate for TRC for the full year in 2015 and in the near term beyond 2015 annual effective cash tax rate less than 15%. That concludes my review. And I will now turn the call back over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you, Matt. Thank you to my team and for a few listeners sending me an email correcting a speaking error. I really apologize. But before I go on to some more color I want to correct that. As I repeated our volume guidance from a few weeks ago, I should have said that we believe that Field Gathering and Processing Operations will likely have flat to single digit 2015 average volume growth compared to fourth quarter 2014. Currently an inability to read I said first quarter 2014; it did not change our guidance. But that’s actually kind of a nice opportunity incase you got distracted by my inability to read, to repeat that we are also the same, just sharing the facts with you that you can see now Q1, 2015 versus Q1 2014 volumes were up across Field Gathering and Processing. There were a few business units in Gathering and Processing that were a little down due to the kind of normal seasonal cold weather and freeze also that affected them. But I also will add that current volumes today over the last week that those current volumes which aren’t published anywhere are up in total in the Field Gathering and Processing versus what we just published for Q1. That’s true for essentially all of our systems across the combined companies and it is true for all of our Texas and Permian Basin business units, and that’s when I said that’s good news. The volume in those business units has exceeded our first review expectations and that’s supportive of our strong beliefs about 2015 and the multiple scenarios we’ve earned. Now with a little bit more color and then I’ll wrap it up for your Q&A, please feel free to email any other questions you have about my ability to read. On the downstream side, our Train 5 is under construction and is expected to be operational by mid 2016. We are also working closely with Noble as they evaluate whether to move forward with a new terminal with significant storage capacity at Patriot, a condensate splitter at Channelview as originally had announced or both projects. Repeating what I think I said before there were renegotiated agreements with Noble have resulted in increased opportunity for Targa versus the original deal without Targa taking own any additional risk. And we expect Noble decisions on the project or projects later this year. Turning to our Gathering and Processing division, we have spent a substantial amount of time reviewing all of our potential projects. As appropriate sizing and timing is obviously dependant on our view of future expected producer activity levels. In North Dakota, we completed our 40 million cubic feet a day Little Missouri 3 Badlands expansion in the first quarter. We continue to review the appropriate sizing and timing of additional plant capacity and related infrastructure in North Dakota and in the Permian Basin and have included ranges for potential 2015 for both of these areas in our growth CapEx forecast. We are also spending capital in 2015 and a number of other high returning G&P projects that individually require relatively small capital outlays. Examples of that kind of work include additional compression at Stonewall, Oklahoma to increase capacity to $200 million cubic feet a day. That project was originally expected to be completed in the first quarter of this year. It will now be done late in the second. Another example would be adding infrastructure to increase our reach into the Delaware Basin, to more increasing volumes to available processing capacity across our multi-plant Versado system. And we remained very enthusiastic about opportunities across our entire Permian Basin footprint, where volumes to-date have been better than our first year expectation for opportunities for smaller high return project are expected to continue and where the super system creates opportunities to met customer needs with greater capital efficiency as to what many refer to as our development backlog. We continue to pursue an additional $3 billion plus of growth projects that we have discussed publicly. And of course there are other projects that are public that we’re working on. The public ones include, Train 6 where we’ve applied for a permit and have passed the first public notice period with the design similar to Trains 4 and 5. We do not currently have the timeline for Train 6 like some of the other projects on this list. It’s a matter of when, not if, we will need additional fractionation at Mont Belvieu . In addition to Train 6 the other when, not if projects included on our investor slide or Train 7, and of course additional G&P expansion programs. The potential Targa’s ethane export project has a little different characterization. We believe that there will be another ethane export project on the Gulf Coast and believe that we have a good shot at it. Discussions are active including new enquiries that off take decisions for new infrastructure are developing more slowly in the current environment. We’re not the only candidate for the second Gulf Coast ethane project, but we have a good shot at it. We are now approximately 70 days in to our merger with Atlas and are pleased with the performance of the employees and assets particularly in this uncertain environment. When we announced the mergers we provided expectations of synergies and we have realized a sizeable amount of synergies through interest in G&A savings alone. We are already witnessing the potential from the breath of relationships and opportunities that our increased asset footprint affords which for me is the most important as I think about Targa’s long-term opportunities. We’re on track to realize our initial announced synergy expectations and we do not expect to provide an ongoing checklist of individual line items related to synergies going forward. You will see our combined results. Our day-to-day operations across multiple areas are managed as one Targa’s business with one collective Targa goal to work collaboratively, send capital efficiently and drive our bottom line results. The current environment continues to be challenging as the volatility and commodity prices creates uncertainly around producer activity levels. We believe that the combination of our asset footprint and our fee based margin positions us well to continue to deliver results. As I said earlier, given everything we know today, we are projecting 4% to 7% distribution growth at TRP and 25% dividend growth at TRC for 2015. And importantly, managing our businesses prudently today with the same multiyear view will position us to continue to perform in the future. So with that, we’ll open it up to questions. I’ll turn it back to you operator.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Schneur Gershuni from UBS.
Schneur Gershuni: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Matt Meloy: Hey, good morning.
Schneur Gershuni: I guess my first question and maybe you touched on this in your prepared remarks. But given that you have had the assets now for about two months with respect to Atlas and so forth, and it sounds like so far the flavor has been positive rather than negative, but is there any way to sort of give us some color in terms of incremental opportunities that you were talking about, beyond what you were thinking about when the assets were put together? You had mentioned high-return, low-multiple type projects. Can you give us a little bit of a sense of where those returns would shake out and so forth in how they relate? Just a little bit more color would be great?
Joe Bob Perkins: I understand the question Schneur. Targa standalone frequently had high return projects that didn’t hit the radar scope of our investors or kind of the large board approved projects. When we put these together we have even more of those. The Atlas standalone list was the same. And the combined list comes with things that we want on either one of the individual list. Even in this price environment and maybe even more so in this price because we don’t have to run as hard for some of those big project, we get engineers and commercial people, operations people looking for those opportunities. And we can certainly fund high return opportunities, whereas outlays by itself may have add a little bit more cash constraints. Our people like going after those opportunities and that collaborative effort across the teams just keeps turning them up. I expect that will be – will continue to be exceeding our expectations and I know you would like more numbers around that but you ask for more color around it.
Schneur Gershuni: Okay. As a follow-up question, lot of your peers talked about it during their fourth quarter calls, about pulling off the playbook from the last time we had commodity collapse and efforts that they were taking to reduce cost and so forth and recognize that you’re in the process of going through the merger and so forth. Can we sort of expect this playbook out of Targa and especially with opportunities as you look at rationalizing both sets of businesses?
Joe Bob Perkins: I’m quite sure that other companies use the term playbook as well. We use the term playbook in an employee presentation in December of last year that became public as it happened to have the word Atlas in it, and I think we talked about it in our year-end call. We absolutely are using that playbook and coming up with other ways of attacking it. And I think because of the experience and urgency of the situation post-Thanksgiving given at last year I’m very proud of our employees. If you look at our financial results just the published you can see traction on the cost reduction scenario. It doesn’t show up everywhere but what I know is we’re making real and significant progress on operating expense reduction, G&A reduction, maintenance cap door reduction all with out reducing safety or reducing our ability to meet environmental regulations and additionally we tell people to think about the small dollars to spend to retain the options to grow, but we’re still getting that cost and cash savings. So, I’m proud of the efforts I’m not comparing myself to others, but internally continue to keep – we intent to keep working on that through 2015 and 2016.
Schneur Gershuni: Great, one last final question, you distribution growth rate for NGLS is fairly wide. You had a pro forma coverage ratio at 1.2 times. Is it fair to assume that if you hold this ratio throughout the balance of the year that we can see the growth rate towards the top end of that range?
Joe Bob Perkins: A range that we thought was a likely range. I feel pretty good about it.
Matt Meloy: Yes. We made our best estimate kind of given current conditions, prices, volumes that we’re seeing. We thought we would be at about 1.0 times distribution coverage. And so with that 1.0 distribution coverage we thought we would at 4% to 7%. So, it is maybe a bit of a wide range but finding kind of clarity on where things are going to shake out with balance of the year we wanted to give ourselves some cushion.
Schneur Gershuni: Great. Thank you very much guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Lasky with Morgan Stanley.
Brian Lasky: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Matt Meloy: Hi, Brian.
Brian Lasky: Just to start out, have you guys disclosed what the benefit of the commercial arrangement renegotiation was within your logistics segment for the quarter?
Joe Bob Perkins: No.
Brian Lasky: Is that a number we can get or no? Just order of magnitude?
Joe Bob Perkins: The way I would like to put it is, we’ve got a very important commercial arrangement with Noble.
Brian Lasky: Okay.
Joe Bob Perkins: We got a close relationship with them. We probably could assume that we’ve got some confidentiality arrangements with them. Sometimes in confidentiality arrangements what you say publicly is driven by what you’re required to say working with accounts and auditors we’ve published what we believe is appropriate for disclosure.
Brian Lasky: Fair enough. In terms of -- I just if you could just kind of talk about the change in your tax rate at the TRC level within your most recent guidance and how that could potentially change, maybe just kind of walk through kind of the major moving parts there?
Matt Meloy: Yes. There are really two large buckets, one of them is the additional benefit from the depreciation we’ll get approximately $1.6 billion amortization of let’s call it goodwill over 15 year straight line in conjunction with closing the Atlas ATLS acquisition. So that’s one piece. The other piece is the amount of taxable income that slows up from NGLS up to TRC through its ownership in the LP units and with the EBITDA on taxable being lower than previous expectations when we put the merger estimates out there for EBITDA and income and the like taxable income is down from there as well. So it’s really those two buckets that brought our tax rate down. It was close to about 2% and Q1 we’ll expect that to kind of increase over the year and we’re currently expecting give or take 5% to 10%, although probably more – probably closer to the low side of that range.
Brian Lasky: Got it. Got it. So relative to your previous guidance that you provided post the merger, the second bucket there is the biggest delta. So if your taxable income goes up here, you’d expect to kind of migrate back toward the previous level there?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes. And its also IDR growth and distribution growth at the partnership, so whereas the previous estimates were 11% to 13%, now 4% to 7% distribution growth, lower associated IDR associated with that you get no depreciation, that’s all taxable income at the IDRs. So with the lower distribution profile that also brought the tax rate down.
Brian Lasky: Got it; makes sense. And then in terms of your volumes, you guys mentioned in your deck the volumes could be down in 2016 relative to 2015. I was just wondering what assumptions were baked in there. Maybe if you guys can just break it up by region how you are thinking of volume trajectories from the balance of the year, particularly in the Bakken which was obviously up pretty strong in the first quarter here?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes. I would say it reflected our current discussion we’ve had with our producers across the multiple basis. So we haven’t -- producer the discussion down the Permian and Mid-Continent, South Texas, North Dakota, across all of our systems and that factored in our best estimates given those producer discussions that we had. And it pointed to potentially lower 2016 volume versus 2015.
Brian Lasky: And then, just one final one from me, in terms of you guys mentioned about different factors for your – for why your export volumes came in where they did, how much of do you think was driven by the environment versus kind of ship availability and pricing and the other factor that you mentioned there?
Joe Bob Perkins: When we describe the environment, okay and market dynamics, it’s including that full combination, global prices, ship availability, ship availability and supply/demand impact the freight costs, so it’s intertwined and I don’t think I can break it apart for you.
Brian Lasky: Okay. And then just in terms of frac volumes, is there anything specific this quarter that occur?
Matt Meloy: No, nothing specific, the frac volumes across CBF are impacted by volumes out in the field which we saw the weather, cold weather can impact volume. It hit our fields a little bit too and it will hit the associated NGL production.
Joe Bob Perkins: We have – our own maintenance work like everyone else, but I won’t say there was anything out of the norm at all particularly for our Q1.
Brian Lasky: Perfect. I will jump back in queue. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Olsen with Tudor, Pickering.
Brad Olsen: Good morning, gentlemen.
Matt Meloy: Hey, good morning.
Brad Olsen: Just a relatively big-picture question here. As we see liquids inventories start to move up or beyond uncharted territories and we had the release on Force Majeure at Hattiesburg, can you just outline what this year and maybe the next hold as far as NGL supply/demand and the process of maybe taking a little breather here on production growth versus export terminal capacity builds?
Joe Bob Perkins: Actually I'm going to the question again, maybe I just didn’t hear the last part of it correctly.
Brad Olsen: I’m just looking for a near term supply demand outlook on liquids as we move through this year, volume growth versus export terminal capacity growth?
Matt Meloy: The export terminal capacity across the U.S. has expanded. There are now three LPG export facilities in the Gulf Coast and those are connected to the market hub. Our crystal ball on supply for LPG across the U.S. and supplies for LPG’s to U.S Gulf Coast comes with the pretty wide range and we’re trying to work multiple scenarios for it. Broadly I think your question somewhat provided the directional answer and that is decreasing number of wells being drilled and either slower growth or slightly reduced production depending on where you are looking specially as lowered overall supply, but the export terminal still are higher necessary for balancing supply to U.S. demand and then to global demand. You use the term I think of something like a cooling down of U.S. driven supply that helps with the inventory problem you were talking about and it slows the need for additional export facilities but probably says that the export facilities are still necessary to balance supply and demand that’s what exports from the U.S. has always done and I probably don’t have anything more specific in that podium.
Brad Olsen: Fair enough. Appreciate the color, though. And then second question going down at the micro level, Buffalo expansion, presumably tied to Pioneer's plans for the back half of this year. Can you just – so you pushed that project, the incremental capacity, out into 2016? Is Pioneer or just kind of how does that sync up with the potential for Pioneer to add another 12 rigs in the back half of this year? Does that timeline change? Or is that anticipating that ramp back up in activity?
Matt Meloy: Our official timeline of sometime in 2016 is unchanged. We have some options for capacity out there, not only the Buffalo plant but there is also 45 million embedded plant out in that area. And then potential they connect to the legacy Targa SAOU systems for capacity as well. So we’ll be working through all of those scenarios and trying to come up with we’re not only meeting pioneers needs but the other producers in the area.
Brad Olsen: Again thank for the color. Helpful. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Global Hunter Securities.
Matt Meloy: Hey, Sunil.
Sunil Sibal: Hi. Good morning, guys. Congrats on the good solid quarter. Couple of questions from me, changing the track little bit. I was kind of curious with regard to you ethane export project, do you think this slowing down of discussions, is it primarily driven by Brent price or the other factors like slow demand in Asia and all that, which is contributing to that?
Joe Bob Perkins: I think its multiple factors and uncertainties slowed it down. Some of those are related. But I still believes it’s a question of if, not when and it’s certainly will be driven by customers.
Sunil Sibal: Sure. Any guess you would like to take in terms of where you need to see Brent prices to be for discussion to become really active again?
Joe Bob Perkins: No. I think it’s more complicated than just Brent pricing.
Sunil Sibal: Okay. Fair enough. And then just one clarification with regard to where your current volumes are tracking in the field G&P, so seems like you had some weather disruptions in the Q1 which impacted those volumes and that’s of course been resolved ex those disruption would you say you’re still tracking higher or even with the Q1 volume?
Matt Meloy: We believe that we’re up on almost every business unit, kind of no matter how you parse it.
Joe Bob Perkins: Right. And we’re up over – current volumes are up over Q1. They are also up over Q4 as well.
Sunil Sibal: Okay. That’s helpful. And then lastly on the Badlands side on the crude gathering volumes, any specific trends you’re seeing currently with all activity level going on?
Matt Meloy: We’re foreseeing some reduced activity and completions in that area. You saw sequentially the volumes down a bit, up in that region, part of it is due to the cold weather and just being the winter there is less activity in the first quarter. So far currently we’re seeing volumes not continuing that decline. So far we kind of add or above where we were in the first quarter. We’ll see if that hold, but that’s what we really seen here over the last few lines.
Joe Bob Perkins: And we continue to have opportunities for backlog volumes can quality, I’m not going to quantify them for you, but we are working hard on projects to help with that on the gas side and the crude side.
Sunil Sibal: All right. That’s very helpful and that’s all I had.
Operator: Our next question comes from J.R. Weston with Raymond James.
J.R. Weston: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Matt Meloy: Hi. Good morning. 
J.R. Weston: Just thinking about the Field G&P segments, what do you think are maybe the geographic segments that you are most concerned about, just on the unit volume side. And then may asking another way with all your discussions you been having with producers what are some of the areas that maybe that taking a little bit higher on the cost curve would be maybe for Western or Southern Oklahoma segments or somewhere else?
Joe Bob Perkins: My biggest concern just kind of the way you described it continues to be North Dakota because it’s hard to see where pricing shakes out and what that means for longer term activity in the Bakken. I think its got greater challenges because of the differentials to WTI as well as where WTI might shake up, but it also had some compensating opportunities. More cost reduction available to help producer activity levels. But we aren’t a whole lot smarter than the past few months when we talked about this. We’re trying to work through multiple uncertainties, understanding and getting a better understanding why Basin or how producers are likely to drive their activity levels relative to different price scenarios. But the price scenarios are still uncertain.
J.R. Weston: Okay, sure. Thank you. Then maybe switching gears a little bit to the downstream segments, are you guys seeing anything at all in terms of more opportunities with butane? Just with the overall move in crude and purity product pricing the last six to nine months, maybe exporting a little bit more butane as a portion of overall LPG exports, or maybe moving a little bit further downstream and getting into some products like maybe high-purity isobutylene or something like that, where you can kind of arbitrage maybe the, I guess, pricing there between normal butane and isobutylene. Or then also capture the fee for loading either one onto the vessels through your docks?
Joe Bob Perkins: I don’t have specific projects to describe like that. I would go back to your comment on butane. We have opportunities to export butane, have some long-term options with our shippers to do so. We continue to export butane every quarter. These changes one month to the next about where is the best arbitrage will drive. Our shippers request to use those options and we’re prepared to provide that service propanes, butanes and we sometime look it other projects.
J.R. Weston: Okay, great. Thank you. That's all I had. 
Operator: The next question comes from TJ Schultz with RBC Capital.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hi, TJ
Matt Meloy: Hi, TJ
TJ Schultz: Hi. Good morning. Maybe Matt, can you just explain on the distribution coverage outlook, against the interim one time this year? As volumes are trending higher and I guess the simple read-through is that you may trend higher or to the higher end of your revised distribution growth range, can you get there -- to the higher end of that range and have some excess coverage? Or what is your view on coverage? You've said before you would have comfort with a one times coverage for a period of time if you have a view that prices are going to improve. So are you still comfortable there? Or has that view on commodity prices changed at all into 2016?
Matt Meloy: You know, TJ, I think I’d just say, we baked in to that assumption kind of flat to low single-digit volume growth. Where we stand today maybe things are looking up bit better but its still early in the year, I think we’re still comfortable that at a 4% to 7% distribution growth range we’ve covered almost all the likely outcomes for our distribution growth for the year and under a range of those scenarios we get to around one, if we’re on the high side of that I think we’re still around one, maybe a little higher. If we’re in the low side of some of those estimates maybe we’re at one or maybe a little below, but we didn’t put a range on distribution coverage for those it takes a fair amount of op margin change to move that needle from around one.
TJ Schultz: Okay. Maybe just clarify for me the comments on volume. I guess the press release two weeks ago read a little bit more conservatively on volumes than what I think I am hearing today, that it seems like things are exceeding your expectations. So, I guess if you could just clarify that for me?
Matt Meloy: And TJ I think the point we wanted to draw was in several of our systems Q1 was sequentially lower than Q4, so we didn’t want to just give you that information and not provide you an update. We aren’t seeing that continued decline we saw in Q1. The Q1 decline we saw in some of our field volumes was due to seasonal weather effects, so we’re bit higher than that, that doesn’t mean we’re bullish and where volumes are going to be for now for the rest of the year. We just wanted to share that data point that you necessary just draw straight line as things have peaks and rolled over. But it’s still early and we’ll have to see where volumes shake out.
Joe Bob Perkins: And just in case anyone is parsing the text or parsing the answers to the questions TJ, we haven’t changed our outlook from the time we gave guidance with the last distribution declaration. We did provide some additional information and consistent with when we gave distribution declaration additional outlook/guidance, we had seen volumes behave better than our first of your expectations, that was into that guidance of multiple scenarios and what we should provide as a likely occurrence for distribution and dividends, does that help a little.
TJ Schultz: Yes. No, that does; I appreciate the clarification. Just one last thing I think to follow-up. I guess like some constraints for export on ship availability. Is that something that continues as a headwind, or how much of a constraint other ships? Supply/demand are impacting ship availability for our customers and other international buyers. With the current fleet, I mean, we know of some of the fleet being moved to longer hauls. If you take a portion of the fleet and it’s taking longer hauls, you certainly have less capacity like, because the turnaround takes longer. All other ships coming on that will relieve the constraint on ship probably lower vessel freight cost over time. It is a market dynamic than we try to use that term challenging market dynamics, some of which will get better for customers and other international buyers every time.
TJ Schultz: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Edwards of Credit Suisse.
John Edwards: Yes, good morning, everybody.
Matt Meloy: Hi. Good morning, John.
John Edwards: If I could ask about just on your distribution guidance, just parse that a little bit. So you are basically saying 4% to 7% given a range of commodity price scenarios and volume scenarios that you are considering. And so, I don't think, unless I missed it, I don't think you've given us any guidance beyond that. But I am just thinking, I mean, if you were looking at, say, you are at the upper end of your range, would you hold back a little bit so you could, say, smooth it out going forward? Or how are you thinking now about sort of the three-year outlook, if you will?
Joe Bob Perkins: Fighting over who would answer the question.
Matt Meloy: Back and forth on who's going to answer the question? Of course we look – first thing, we’re not provide 2016 or beyond guidance. But I would say with each quarterly distribution, recommendation we make we look out multiple years and we’re trying to move a distribution growth rate and dividend growth rate appropriately smooth. So, we’re looking out one, two, three, four even five years under multiple scenarios, growth scenarios, sensitivity scenarios, so of course we look at those years, but I’m going to – we’re not going to provide any early indication in the 2016.
John Edwards: That’s helpful. And that’s it from me. Thank you.
Matt Meloy: Okay. Thanks John.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.
Michael Blum: Good morning guys.
Matt Meloy: Hey, good morning.
Michael Blum: A couple of quick questions. One, maybe just one more question on the coverage. Can you – so now you have Atlas inside the family, so to speak, I understand what's going on in 2015. But in terms of your long-term target for coverage, where would you say that is now?
Matt Meloy: Yes. I’d say that remains unchanged in the 1.1 to 1.2 times target distribution coverage.
Joe Bob Perkins: Mike, I think there one could make an argument that the increase scale and diversity might be worthy of a lower target than that, but we haven’t change that target and weather sounds a whole lot like a phrase use with the rating agencies right after the announcement and then the next one the sort of agreement about that but we haven’t changed it and we’re probably not that smart.
Matt Meloy: And we think it’s still appropriate. It makes sense.
Michael Blum: Okay. And the thought for this year, having a one times coverage is that we're in a low commodity price environment?
Matt Meloy: Yes.
Michael Blum: Okay. Another question, just a comment you made in talking about the LPG export business, you talked about anticipating for this year lower fee margins. And I just want to know, does that mean you’re seeing lower spot margins? Or is that that you – as you are signing up short-term contracts they're at lower rates? Just trying to?
Joe Bob Perkins: I had understand the question. We try to signal about as much as we want to do commercially, but that is an appropriate conclusion to come to that with near term lower demand for the short-term contract volumes, those lower spot margins are probably been under more pressure than the term margins. And we got the benefit of some of those higher short term contract margins in the back half of 2014 and we were therefore contrasting what we’re likely to report in 2015 back to the second half of 2014 and I think you have come to the right conclusion.
Michael Blum: Okay, great. Then last question. Just looking at the trend in volume in the Permian, both at SAOU and Sand Hills, we can keep the Atlas stuff out of this for now. So you saw volumes sequentially down, but now you are seeing them uptick here in I guess early second quarter. I guess, what do you attribute that to?
Matt Meloy: Well, so as you got those the pieces there, Michael I know your point is Sand Hills, Sand Hills is essentially full, so there’s some minor moves a few million a day up and down, but its all and it has been basically full. So we’re moving 20 plus million a day closer to 525 million a day over the pipeline over to High Plains SAOU. So – and then we’ve seen SAOU quarter-to-quarter relatively flat down slightly due to some weather and seasonal effects but we’re backup a little bit now.
Michael Blum: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: Broadly Permian basin activity is pretty darn good given the price environment and the uncertainty and our volume increases have been robust. We’re looking for little ways to create capacity. I like using the little ways, because they don’t hit your radar scope. How can we add capacity to the Sand Hill system perhaps with small plant tack-on plant, small acquired plant. Heck, we're adding capacity to Sand Hill system by moving gas from Sand Hills to the High Plains, that’s added capacity on the East side and then help a lot on the west side and we move gas around. We now have an expanded and increasingly overtime interconnected footprint of the super system and that allows us to create ways to add small capacity for the benefit of the Sand Hills opportunities. But that’s not the only place that’s growing. I mean, I can’t tell you how happy I am to see the growth in Versado. Michael, you remember how many years we went saying that flat is slightly down. We’re just building up existing capacity there.
Michael Blum: Got it. Thank you, Joe Bob.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jerren Holder with Goldman Sachs.
Jerren Holder: Hi. Just wanted to start off with -- is there any change as far as the commodity hedging strategy now that you have Atlas combined in there?
Joe Bob Perkins: No, I’d say no change to our strategies. I think going forward put in I’d say maybe slightly more programmatic approach disciplined approach to be kind of putting some on quarter to quarter but it will be the similar you hedge more volumes kind of in the first year and then declined volumes in year two and three for crude NGLs and natural gas.
Jerren Holder: I know before you guys had for ethane and propane, you were leaving those mainly open. Is that how we should think about it still, going forward?
Joe Bob Perkins: I would say for NGLs even in ethane and propane we could possibly add some hedges and look at some hedges down there. I don’t know that we will get all the ways that kind of made up into our target range 75% year one, 50% year 2, 25% year 3 I don’t know that we get all the way there [Indiscernible] but probably more than zero.
Jerren Holder: Okay, that's helpful. Just in terms of M&A strategy, obviously there are a lot of assets out there; and of course there have been buyers or potential bidders for you guys as well. How has that strategy changed on bought angles, at all? How should we think about the Targa approach in this environment?
Joe Bob Perkins: How has it changed on what?
Jerren Holder: How should we think about your current M&A strategy in this environment, whether or not you would be looking at some of the midstream assets that are out there? Or is the focus just more internally integrating the Atlas system and getting through this environment?
Joe Bob Perkins: Our strategy is not really any different. We look at acquisitions every day. In this environment kind of a little uncertain everyone was trying to be a little conservative and prudent. The acquisitions we like to best are smaller tack-on ones because that won’t have any real impact on our leverage and has an immediate impact on our cash flows. Those are wonderful ones when you find them. Strategic acquisitions that make the current businesses we have better, that gets most attention. A step out without leverage to our existing assets, we still look at but it’s get less of our attention today. And all of that’s fairly natural. Also in the cycle of buyers and sellers before everything starts gets rosier that may be some – be the time for some of the best bargains and we would want not be looking for.
Jerren Holder: Thanks, that's helpful. Then lastly, I know you mentioned on the synergies that you see in the G&A; this is definitely an area where you've seen like immediate savings. The run rate that we are seeing here in first quarter, should we use that as to -- maybe in the next few quarters use that as a guideline? Or should we expect that number to go up, down over time? How should we think about that?
Joe Bob Perkins: Q1 is going to be tough. We only had one month of TPLs in there. So I think if you look at APLs previous G&A and then you’ll have to – it will be lower than – because they have some allocations from APL unless they are going to be going away. There is a line item you can see that essentially says New York and Philadelphia G&A charges on it, that’s not there anymore, but you just have not seen enough and we are going to be working the synergy spread sheet for you and it will be shown in our overall results and very encouraged by how that will all account.
Jerren Holder: All right. Thank you.
Operator: The last question comes from Andy Gupta with HITE hedge.
Andy Gupta: Well hi congratulations on your quarter. A couple of questions, one is in South Texas, I was curious if you can give some more color on activity there you’ve got a really good plant that can potentially give you some volumes. What are you seeing in terms of prospects for that?
Joe Bob Perkins: I understand the question; our employees on the TPL side were sort of used to providing business unit by business unit detailed in with South Texas being one of dozen business units listed there. I’m not going to go into more detail other than to say based on our past statements we feel good about South Texas and what we paid for it upside potential from where it currently exists and a stronger ability to compete that as the combined companies then Atlas on – with by themselves. If there is anything to announce there or sub sense of materiality we’ll report that in due course but not how it’s going.
Andy Gupta: Understood. No, thanks for that color. And one last question is, in terms of funding plans for your growth CapEx, can you give us a sense of -- given where your leverage levels are, how do you plan to fund this? Would it be through an ATM? Do you plan to come to market for equity, or it's going to be more debt?
Joe Bob Perkins: You know our growth CapEx for the year is about $700 million to $900 million in growth capital. We’ve – our target is about 50% debt, 50% equity and if you look over the last several years we’ve been pretty good at staying for that target. But in any given year we can vary those percentages. So in a year like this, it’s likely to be more skewed to the equity side. Then I’ll just say on equity raises we’ve been active in the ATM. We’ve have good success there. But I am not going to handicap or tip my hat on what we may or may not do. We have all options available to us and we’ll continue to look at all available options and what the best way to raise that equity is. The ATM has been working and with the ATM working that makes those other options even more available if you wanted them.
Andy Gupta: Yes. This is great. Thank you so much.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the question and answer portion of today’s conference. I’d like to turn the call back over to Joe Bob Perkins.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you, operator. Thank you everyone for your patience and interest in what maybe our record long call. If you have any other questions, feel free to give Jen, Matt, me or any other rest of the team at call. Have a good day.
Operator: Well ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

===== 2014 Q4  (2015-02-13 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Targa Resources Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Ms. Jennifer Kneale, Director of Finance. Ma'am, you may begin. 
Jennifer Kneale: Thank you, Ben. I'd like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and full year 2014 investor call for both Targa Resources Corp. and Targa Resources Partners LP. Before we get started, I would like to mention that Targa Resources Corp., TRC, or the company; and Targa Resources Partners LP, Targa Resources Partners, or the partnership, have published their joint earnings release, which is available on our website, www.targaresources.com. We will also be posting an updated investor presentation to the website later today. 
 I would like to remind you that any statements made during this call that might include the companies' or the partnership's expectations or projections should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Please note that actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings, including the partnership's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. 
 Speaking on the call today will be Joe Bob Perkins; Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Meloy, Chief Financial Officer. Joe Bob will start off with a high-level review of performance and highlights. He will then turn it over to Matt to review the partnership's consolidated financial results, its segment results and other financial matters. Matt will also review key financial matters related to Targa Resources Corp. Following Matt's comments, Joe Bob will provide some concluding remarks, and then we will take your questions. There are also several other members of the management team available who may assist in the Q&A session. 
 With that, I will turn the call over to Joe Bob Perkins. 
Joe Perkins: Thanks, Jen. Good morning, and thanks to everyone for participating. Before we turn to Targa's results, I'd like to provide you with a brief update on the status of our transaction with Atlas. The remaining step in closing the transaction from our side is the Targa Resources Corp. shareholder vote, which is scheduled for February 20. As you probably know, all 3 shareholder advisory services: Glass, Lewis; ISS; and Egan-Jones, all recommended that their clients vote their approval of the merger, recommending the vote for TRGP to issue shares in connection with the merger, and we fully expect the transaction to close on February 28. We are coordinating closely with Atlas management who will soon be Targa employees as we head toward close. And the more we interact, the more we realize that the fit of the businesses and the fit of the people are extraordinary. 
 Since we announced the Atlas transaction in October 2014, commodity prices have moved downward, but the Targa and Atlas pro forma combination is better positioned than either partnership stand-alone. Targa is adding scale and diversity with very well-positioned assets and very good people. And our well-received access to the capital markets since the beginning of the year illustrates our financial strength even in challenging commodity markets. Under any reasonable forward price forecast, the merger with Atlas is a great combination, and we are excited to be close to finally getting the deal closed. 
 Let's now discuss Targa's performance highlights during the fourth quarter and across 2014, plus some color around current market conditions. As you saw from our press release, we are pleased to announce that 2014 was a record year for Targa on multiple fronts: record adjusted EBITDA of $970 million, an increase of 53% over 2013, very strong performance given 2013 was a record year also; record Logistics and Marketing division operating margin of $695 million; record Gathering and Processing division operating margin of $450 million; record distributable cash flow of $763 million; record 69% of margin from fee-based operations in 2014; and a record 76% in the fourth quarter of 2014; and of course, increasing distributions and dividends to record levels for both TRP and TRC. 
 We placed a number of key projects in service in 2014, including: our 200 million cubic feet a day Longhorn plant in North Texas; our 200 million cubic feet a day High Plains plant in SAOU; the Midland County pipeline connecting our Sand Hills system to the High Plains system, and please note that this pipeline also runs through the Atlas West Texas system; and we completed the second phase of our international export expansion. 
 Completing that second phase of our export expansion contributed to another year of record operating margin for our Logistics and Marketing division, up 64% compared to 2013. Daily LPG export volumes increased by 81% in the fourth quarter of 2014 versus the fourth quarter of 2013. We were able to move approximately 6.8 million barrels per month of propane and butane across our dock during the fourth quarter, and I want to provide you with some color around that business as our Mont Belvieu and Galena Park assets outperformed our multiperiod effective capacity of 6.5 million barrels per month. 
 With a fourth quarter average of 6.8 million barrels per month, our estimated multiperiod 6.5 million barrels per month effective capacity may ultimately prove to be conservative. We have only 4 months of reported performance since we completed the second phase, and we will have a much better handle on multiperiod capability after a full year of operation. 
 LPG export cargoes from our facility are going predominantly to the Americas but an increasing number of vessels are also moving to the Mediterranean, European and Eastern markets. As you can tell, our facility has been heavily utilized, and I can report that we have not had a ship cancellation since the first quarter of 2014. Now contracting demand may not be as heated as it was at this point last year, but through the fourth quarter since the price shock and year-to-date, we have continued to add long- and short-term contracts at similar terms to our existing portfolio. 
 In May of last year, the last time that we provided export contract numbers, we said that we had 4.2 million barrels per month of LPG exports contracted for the remainder of 2014 and that we were similarly contracted for 2015. Today, while we are reluctant to disclose much about our export contracting for competitive reasons, we will say that we are in a better contracting position than last year at this time, with over 4.2 million barrels per month contracted in 2015. And we will say that for 2016, we are similarly contracted on a 1-year forward basis, as we were in May of last year. Also, based on that contracting, interest and demand to date in our performance history, it is our view that facility utilization may be similar in 2015 to what we saw in the second half of 2014. 
 Moving to our Field Gathering and Processing segment. In 2014, we saw continued strong producer activity across our areas of operation. Volumes were up across the board, and we continued to benefit from increasing contributions from the Badlands assets. Our 40 million a day cubic feet Little Missouri Train 3 processing plant expansion in the Badlands is ready to start up and has been waiting on a third-party NGL pipeline. I'm assured that, that pipeline connection and the planned startup are now expected for next week. 
 With increases each quarter, the partnership's full year 2014 distribution increased 9% over 2013, consistent with our full year guidance that we expected to be at the high end of the 7% to 9% distribution growth range, the high end of the original 7% to 9% distribution growth range. At the TRC level, our full year 2014 dividend was 29% higher over 2013 and above our original 25% plus dividend growth guidance for the year. As a result of our strong performance in 2014, we were able to deliver on our distribution growth guidance while also building coverage. Our 1.5x distribution coverage for the fourth quarter and 1.5x distribution coverage average for 2014 reflects the strong performance of our business and positions us well going forward given the downturn in commodity prices. 
 Similarly, Targa's 2014 performance positions us very well from a liquidity and debt perspective, with a low compliance debt coverage ratio and no borrowings on our $1.2 billion revolver at year-end. At this time last year, you will recall we were discussing some of the factors that were impacting the domestic propane market and the propane price spike. What a difference a year makes. Now we are facing and talking about commodity prices that have decreased significantly over the last 4 months. 
 While I don't pretend to have a unique view into what is going to happen with commodity prices, we are managing the company with the working assumption that 2015 average prices may be somewhat higher than we have experienced to date, but not significantly. And we are managing the company to prepare for a 2016 where commodity prices may be only modestly higher than 2015. As you are aware, there continues to be a lot of uncertainty among our producer customers concerning their level of activity and the resulting volumes. With a significant portion of our business in the Field Gathering and Processing area impacted by that uncertainty, until we have greater clarity on expected producer customer activity levels for 2015, we cannot provide greater clarity on our expectations for the year beyond reiterating what we have already stated publicly, and I will do some of that. 
 When we announced the Atlas transaction in October 2014, we provided guidance for pro forma distribution growth of 11% to 13% at the partnership and dividend growth of approximately 35% at TRC, obviously based on different price environment and the expected producer activity and resulting volumes at that time and in that price environment. 
 In early December 2014, Targa issued a press release that provided additional information concerning potential distributions, dividends and coverage, including comfort that our previous pro forma distributions and dividend guidance under a couple of price and price-related volume scenarios, including the scenario on the lower end described as: number one, average 2015 prices of $60 per barrel of crude oil, $0.60 per gallon for NGLs and $3.75 per MMBtu for natural gas; secondly, low single-digit growth related to that price outlook for 2015 over our Q4 2014 pro forma Field Gathering and Processing volumes; and thirdly, and not necessarily a direct price relation, a conservative statement that we were only including LPG export volumes that were already under contract as of the date of the press release. So with that scenario, we estimate a distribution coverage of approximately 1.0x. 
 The December press release indicated our comfort with reduced coverage in a lower commodity price environment. We believe it also provides investors with another data set, including commodity prices, volume assumptions and resulting coverage, making it possible to mathematically extrapolate beyond the points provided for the potential impact on coverage at nearby price levels. 
 We want to reiterate what we have said about how we will think about our distribution and dividend decisions. Consistent with our history, we will continue to recommend quarterly distribution and dividends to our boards using a multiyear view, with our best available information at the time. Using a multiyear approach helps us to continue to try to deliver a smooth distribution and smooth dividend track record. We approached the announcement of Targa's stand-alone distribution and dividends on January 21 in that same way, and we will do so again when we approach the Targa distributions and dividends for the first quarter. Those will be announced sometime in mid April, of course, after the merger close at the end of February. As we have demonstrated in the past, we are very willing to have coverage go below our long-term target of 1.1x to 1.2x, assuming we and the board have comfort in an overall outlook that eventually returns to our long-term target.  
 Now today, prices are meaningfully lower than the scenarios presented in the December press release. At this point, while still faced with significant uncertainty around pricing and producer activity, we believe that the previously provided scenarios and a reiteration of how we will address distributions and dividends, allows our investors to understand those future decisions in light of those uncertainties. We will continue to monitor price outlooks, producer activity levels, and we'll update you with additional information if and when appropriate. 
 For our next quarterly distribution and dividend declarations, within current prices and with the best information we have for price and producer volume outlooks at the time, you can assume that we will decide the quarterly distribution and dividend and coverages that are related to that with a multiyear outlook in mind, and we may provide additional explanation of our thinking at that time. 
 I'd like to conclude my introductory remarks by thanking the entire Targa team and for the Atlas team, soon to be the Targa team, for a successful 2014 and for their hard work that began last quarter, preparing for the current price environment. When we had an all-employee meeting in early December, many of those employees were already working on 3 priorities for 2015: increased cost management, focus on capital investment efficiency and looking for other opportunities that price dislocations bring to our business. Since then, the entire organization, and I understand that a similar signal was sent to the Atlas organization, has been focused on those 3 priorities while continuing to meet the needs of our customers. 
 So as we report on the close of 2014, it feels appropriate to look back at a high level at performance over the last few years and how that performance positions us for the future. The following simple data points are pretty impressive: 2012 adjusted EBITDA of $519 million; 2013 adjusted EBITDA of $635 million; 2014 adjusted EBITDA of $970 million. And now early in 2015, we are nearing the close of the Atlas transaction, adding very complementary assets and people and resulting in a combined Targa with an enterprise value of about $19 billion, and scale and diversity of businesses that strongly positions us for the future. 
 With those not-so-brief remarks, I'll now call -- turn it over to Matt. Matt? 
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Joe Bob. I'd like to add my welcome and thank everyone for joining our call today. Joe Bob discussed some full year 2014 records, highlights and context for 2015, so now let's turn our attention to Q4 results. 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was a record $258 million compared to $216 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by a 26% increase in operating margin from our Logistics and Marketing division, resulting from increased LPG export and fractionation activities. Our Field Gathering and Processing margin increased by 5% driven by contributions from the Longhorn plant that commenced operations in May 2014 and the High Plains plant that commenced operations in June 2014, plus higher natural gas prices, offset by significantly lower NGL and condensate prices. Overall, operating margin increased 12% for the fourth quarter compared to last year, and I will review the drivers of this performance in our segment review. 
 As we have mentioned before, please note that we benefit from the receipt of certain minimum contract payments at year-end that we do not otherwise see in the first 3 quarters of the year. In Q4, approximately $10 million of our operating margin was from the receipt of take-or-pay reservation fee deficiency or other such contract payments. Net maintenance capital expenditures were $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $18 million in 2013, bringing full year 2014 maintenance CapEx to $71 million. 
 Turning to the segment level. I'll summarize the fourth quarter performance on a year-over-year basis, starting with our downstream business. Operating margin in our Logistics Asset segment increased 17% in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 due primarily to higher export and fractionation volumes partially offset by increased operating expenses associated with additional assets in service and higher system maintenance costs. 
 Export activity at our Galena Park Marine Terminal on the Houston Ship Channel increased again this quarter with the second phase of our export expansion project fully completed during the third quarter of 2014. We loaded an average of 226,000 barrels per day or approximately 6.8 million barrels per month. In the Marketing and Distribution segment, operating margin for the segment increased 47% over the fourth quarter of 2013 due primarily to increased LPG activity. 
 Turning now to the Field Gathering and Processing. Our fourth quarter 2014 operating margin increased by approximately 5% compared to last year, driven by the additions of our Longhorn and High Plains plants, which contributed to those increased volumes, and by higher natural gas prices, partially offset by lower NGL and condensate prices. Fourth quarter 2014 natural gas plant inlet for the Field Gathering and Processing segment was 974 million cubic feet per day, a 24% increase compared to the same period in 2013. All of the Field G&P business units had higher natural gas inlet for the quarter. Natural gas inlet volumes increased by approximately 40% at SAOU, 34% at Versado, 24% at Badlands, 20% at North Texas and 8% at Sand Hills. Fourth quarter results for the Field segment also benefited from an increase of 78% in crude oil volumes gathered in the Badlands versus the fourth quarter of 2013. 
 For the segment, we benefited from higher natural gas prices, offset by lower NGL and condensate prices in the quarter. Natural gas prices were 7% higher while NGL prices were 35% lower and condensate prices were 31% lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. In the Coastal Gathering and Processing segment, operating margin decreased 55% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. The decrease was driven by NGL prices that were 31% lower and NGL production that was 10% lower than the same time period last year. 
 With that, let's now move briefly to capital structure and liquidity. At December 31, Targa was in a very strong position from a liquidity standpoint. We had no outstanding borrowings under the partnership's $1.2 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due 2017. With outstanding letters of credit of $42 million and cash on hand of approximately $72 million, total liquidity was approximately $1.23 billion. At December 31, we had borrowings of $183 million under our accounts receivable securitization facility, and during the fourth quarter, we extended the term of our AR facility to December 2015 and maintained the same pricing. In October 2014, we successfully issued $800 million of 4.125% senior unsecured notes maturing in November 2019. On a debt compliance basis, which provides us adjusted EBITDA credit from material growth projects that are in process but not yet complete and other certain adjustments, our total leverage ratio at the end of 2014 was a very strong 2.6x debt-to-EBITDA, and well below our stated target range of 3x to 4x. Pro forma for the closing of the Atlas transaction, we expect this leverage ratio will be at approximately the midpoint of our target range. And for the remainder of 2015, we expect to be within or around the 4x area of our target leverage ratio range. 
 In the fourth quarter, we received gross proceeds of approximately $153 million from equity issuances under our at-the-market equity program, which allows us to periodically sell equity at prevailing market prices. And in 2014, we raised approximately $413 million of gross proceeds under our ATM program. We were very pleased with our ability to access the capital markets early in 2015 even in this challenging commodity price environment. When we announced the Atlas transaction in October 2014, we had $1.1 billion of committed financing in place at TRC through a revolving credit and term loan B facility. Subject to close of the transaction, we have entered into agreements for a $670 million senior secured revolving credit facility, larger than our initial expectations for a $350 million facility, due to a strong bank market support for Targa. The increased revolver, obviously, reduced our borrowing needs for the term loan B, which we have now syndicated and priced a $430 million term loan B offering. In January, we also issued a $1.1 billion of 5% senior unsecured notes maturing in January 2018 at TRP, the proceeds of which will be used to fund tender offers for some of the outstanding Atlas Pipeline notes. 
 We also received commitments to increase our TRP revolver from $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion. In the equity market so far this year, we have raised gross proceeds of approximately $13 million under our ATM program and expect to continue to utilize the ATM to meet our equity funding needs in 2015. With all of the above transactions committed and syndicated, we currently have approximately $2.9 billion of liquidity at TRP and expect to have over $800 million of liquidity after transaction close. At TRC, we expect to have over $200 million of liquidity and a leverage ratio of approximately 4x. 
 Next I'd like to make a few comments about our hedging and capital spending programs for the year. As Joe Bob mentioned at the beginning of our call, our fee-based operating margin was a record 76% in the fourth quarter of 2014, and we averaged a record 69% of margin from fee-based operations in 2014. Pro forma for the Atlas transaction and at today's prices, we would estimate approximately 70% of fee-based margin for 2015. For the non fee-based operating margin relative to the partnership's current equity volumes from Field Gathering and Processing, we estimate that we have hedged approximately 55% of 2015 and 25% of 2016 natural gas volumes, approximately 45% of 2015 and 30% of 2016 condensate volumes and approximately 12% of 2015 NGL volumes. Pro forma for the merger with Atlas, our non fee-based operating margin will increase modestly but the Atlas G&P commodity exposure is more hedged than Targa, and the combination will continue to hedge in a manner consistent with the sum of the parts. 
 Moving to capital spending. In our January investor presentation, we published a preliminary estimate of $490 million to $675 million of growth capital expenditures in 2015. This deal represents a reasonable range of stand-alone Targa growth CapEx expectations. 
 Next, I'll make a few brief remarks about the results of Targa Resources Corp. On January 21, TRC declared a fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.775 per common share or $3.10 per common share on an annualized basis, representing an approximately 20% -- 28% increase over the annualized rate paid with respect to the fourth quarter of 2013. TRC stand-alone distributable cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $38 million and dividends declared were $33 million. At year-end, TRC had $102 million in borrowings outstanding under its $150 million senior secured credit facility and $9 million in cash, resulting in total liquidity of $57 million. 
 That concludes my reviews, so now I'll turn the call back over to Joe Bob. 
Joe Perkins: Thanks, Matt. I'll try to make up for my not-so-brief introduction with a fairly brief conclusion covering some additional thoughts for 2015. In January, we published stand-alone Targa preliminary growth CapEx of $490 million, to $675 million, as Matt mentioned. While the reduction in commodity prices and producer activity is causing us to revisit the optimal sizes and timing of our previously approved and announced new Delaware Basin and Williston Basin plants, and may reduce or slow some of our other capital investment activity on the Gathering and Processing side, on the other hand, this price environment may lead to additional opportunities for a well-positioned Targa. For example, we have modified the existing agreements we had in place with Noble to construct a condensate splitter at our Channelview Terminal. After a brief period of study, Noble and Targa will move forward with either a new Patriot Terminal with significant storage capacity, a splitter at Channelview or perhaps both projects. For structuring some additional optionality into our agreements with Noble, Targa benefited from the receipt of a first quarter payment in 2015 and will receive enhanced economic benefit over the life of the project or projects without taking on any additional risk. 
 Additionally, the contango in commodity prices has already led to significant inbound interest from customers interested in discussing projects with our petroleum logistics team. On the downstream side of our businesses, we are proceeding with the construction of our fifth fractionator at Mont Belvieu. We call it Train 5, and we will submit a permit for Train 6 very soon. We continue to pursue an ethane export project and remain cautiously optimistic. Interest is being driven from a diverse set of potential customers, including pet chems and other end users. While the recent price shock creates some uncertainty and may slow timing of sufficient contracting, the relative economics continue to appear attractive. At Targa, as I said, our day-to-day operations and commercial focus is on managing cost and spending capital efficiency while also looking for opportunities the price changes may create. We are looking forward to the close of the Atlas merger and the ability to work more closely to identify and pursue those same opportunities while we continue to serve our customers' needs. 
 Lessons learned in 2008 and 2009 are being employed again today. Most of our employees automatically pulled out those playbooks and are working together to again implement best practices while also explaining to new employees that Targa is a very sound ship for stormy seas and a ship that can take advantage of opportunities as we navigate those stormy seas. The experienced employees remember that Targa can make a significant difference on cost savings and capital efficiency in such a time and that Targa actually added employees while saving money related to those employees in 2008 and 2009. 
 Before we open up the line to questions, I would just like to thank the Targa team again for another successful year in 2014. Our successes in 2014 have positioned us well for 2015 and 2016. And in the lower price environment of 2015 and 2016, Targa will manage the company and manage its distributions and dividends the same way that it has in the past, with a multiyear view under multiple scenarios. 
 So with that, we'll open it up to questions, and I'll turn it back to you, operator. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Birnbaum of Wunderlich. 
Jeff Birnbaum: So I appreciate the additional color on the call this morning, and I understand kind of obviously some of the conflicting demands that you're given, kind of the desire for more color in a very uncertain environment, but I just want to ask, am I kind of hearing you correctly that kind of in your view in this kind of price environment, maybe we can make our own assumptions perhaps price risk and volume risk given your December guidance -- relative to that, I should say, but that you think that perhaps given a little more updated or optimistic outlook for LPG exports kind of can sort of make up the difference in your view here in terms of your '15 distribution and EBITDA guidance? 
Joe Perkins: Jeff, you covered a few things there. I think you're directionally correct in that, yes, we have lower prices than our December guidance. I believe that, that guidance spoke towards prices and volumes, and you could extrapolate to other price and volume scenarios like a $50.50 world, pretty easily in terms of what that coverage would look like in that $50.50 world, volume-adjusted. Directionally, you're correct. Our export performance is likely to be better than the volume assumptions included in that lower data point. I am not saying that they will offset because I don't know where the lower prices are. I cannot predict a bottom on commodity prices. We're using a working assumption for managing the company that says that prices on average for 2015 may be modestly better than what we've experienced in 1.5 months to date. And with that working assumption that prices are significantly better, it won't be hard for us to adjust. They're a little bit worse, it won't be hard for us to adjust. But I think you can, with your own modeling, assume that we're not concerned with something like 1.0 or 0.9 coverage for a quarter or for a few quarters because that's not difficult for us. And at very low price levels, if we have an outlook that those price levels are going to improve and that activities are going to improve, that's the right way for us to use our coverage. If we were at today's prices flat and knew they were going to be flat through 2016, we certainly could not deliver on that same previous guidance distribution level. But you can do math in between. Was that helpful? 
Jeff Birnbaum: Okay... yes, no -- that is, Joe Bob. And I guess I just wanted to kind of -- 1 additional question kind of on CapEx here. It sounds like kind of full speed ahead with Train 5 and permitting for Train 6, so I guess the kind of read there, is there any other color you can give, I guess, on -- at least in terms of the CapEx for field G&P, how you -- I think you had mentioned that a little bit, Joe Bob, in your comments, where -- how you could kind of see that evolving in '15 and 2016. 
Joe Perkins: Our mindset is to be very efficient with the capital we're spending on the field G&P side while meeting our producers' needs, and we'll do that combined with the Atlas assets. For example, in the Permian, even better, right? Because we've got an even bigger super system that can respond and have available capacity for whenever the uptick goes without having to have spent as much capital early on, and that's a good thing. Our guidance the first part of this year was trying to describe Targa stand-alone, reducing its capital preprice shock estimate for 2015 to 60% to 80% of those original values. And that's done by downsizing and/or delaying primarily Gathering and Processing CapEx. I know enough about the Atlas planning, details that are appropriate to prior close to say that those same sort of directional indicators on their G&P side are appropriate and we might actually spend even less capital. Put the assets together and we're going to be very smart about it without hurting our returns on the capital and probably just delaying some of the projects to make up for delayed producer activity. On the downstream part of our business, you are correct. Train 5 is full speed ahead and so is the permitting on 6, but in the current price environment, with lower resulting LPGs going to Mont Belvieu, it may delay when we actually build Train 6. But again, it's a question of when, not if on Train 6, and we'll add that capacity when it's appropriate for supply needs. The Channelview project in our downstream, I expect we'll be spending about that same amount of capital that we're stepping back and studying or maybe a little bit more with the same EBITDA expectations -- better EBITDA expectations than we had prior to the end of the year renegotiation. Did that help? 
Jeff Birnbaum: Yes, that's very helpful. The 1 follow-up I'd have is -- and I guess it sounds, to the extent you can give color on it that -- and it seems reasonable that, perhaps, you'd see more or less -- more of a -- less CapEx kind of or infrastructure additions on the G&P side from, call it, non-legacy Targa basins than from legacy Targa basins. 
Joe Perkins: I think it's similar in direction and it will be scaled to producer activity. The Atlas, the non-legacy Targa is the soon-to-be former Atlas assets without going into detail right now, we've got a similar picture. Of course, one of the best areas is going to be West Texas, and one of those I'm going to be slowing down is North Dakota. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Olsen of TPH. 
Brad Olsen: Joe Bob, you mentioned enhanced cost management as one of the priorities for 2015. I was wondering if you might be able to provide some color on what those cost management strategies might consist of and how much do you think there might be in terms of cost savings and benefits that you could realize in 2015 and beyond. 
Joe Perkins: Thank you, Brad. I think I'll say, yes, I can help on the first part; then, no, I don't intend to in the second part. For example, our operations managers, all Targa operations managers, what we call area managers, were together last week. And I was pretty enthusiastic to hear how they had already begun to implement the 2008, 2009 playbook. That implementation had not just ideas, but actions and active cost savings occurring in the area of -- I can remember from 2008, they said we want to pay 1x, not 1.5x, and what that means is we can reduce our own overtime, which is a much safer thing to do anyhow, and we've been trying to hire by perhaps adding employees. We can't reduce how much time we're spending with contractors who, in the running gun times, are doing work that Targa employees could otherwise do, and believe me, that cost a lot more than 1.5x. We've got a lot of good contractors. I don't mean to be taking it out on them, but that will be the natural occurrence of things just as it was in '08, '09. I'm interested in cash wherever we can get it. Compressors, we're installing our own compressors and having to dislocate compressors we are leasing, that against an even broader portfolio, with Atlas and Targa combined, there are even more opportunities to do that. There are quite a few costs associated at every plant that sort of went up with oil prices. Believe me, we'll be among the most aggressive of pushing it down with oil prices, and that ranges from chemicals to trucking fees, et cetera, that got their own fuel surcharges. I won't pretend that we've got as much leverage as E&P companies do on third-party providers, but you can assume that our playbook looks very similar to them. That's just a short sample. Our guys came in with a slightly scrubbed budgeting. You know how budgeting occurs. It started last fall -- way before the price shock, and they thought it was finished about the time the price shock occurred. They reduced their OpEx budgets to finally be approved by our boards just after the 1st of the year. Our focus was primarily on EBITDA and margin without getting carried away on what we thought the OpEx budgets could be reduced to. Every one of those area managers told me they would come in under their budgets, and I'm certain they will without giving up at all on what is a very sophisticated preventative maintenance program and without giving up one iota on safety because we've done it before, and most of those area managers were here in '08, '09. Now I know you'd like to know the number. I don't intend to disclose that today, but it is a nice compensating factor as we're working in a lower price environment and we know how to execute. 
Brad Olsen: Got it. That's great color, Joe Bob. One follow-up is on the kind of investment multiple side. When we think about processing plants and G&P activity where historically you've sought 5x to 7x type multiple, that obviously -- it comprises, at least partially, a commodity levered percent of proceeds component. And when you look for projects now or when you're thinking about your budget and potentially deferring certain projects, are you having to kind of move those targets to compensate for what very well could be a lower percent of proceeds type fee over the next couple of years in the lower price environment. 
Joe Perkins: My short answer will be no, I don't expect to see the returns to go down. But then I'll give some more color on that. That 5x to 7x and we've often said it, is how we characterize the major announced projects on our capital budget rollout that we present to the markets. You all know that there are a lot of smaller projects on the list and they do considerably better than 5x to 7x when you're leveraging existing infrastructure. So first of all, in a capital efficiency focused world, producers aren't making great, big changes. They're making more incremental changes and we're hooking up smaller acreage dedications and smaller groups of wells. Those returns, I do not expect to be lower than what you just characterized and, frankly, have never been lower than what you just characterized. Capital efficiency is like in Versado, where we've got active projects now because the activity is still sufficient in the Permian Basin to just lay plastic pipe and add a little bit of compression to bring home producers to existing processing plant capacity. I can assure you, we do better than 5x to 7x on that while still providing a very important service to our customers. Similarly, any of the big projects on the board for downstream, their returns aren't suffering. The remaining downsized potentially delayed projects that we focused on a second ago, meaning the Permian Basin plant and the Badlands plant, I don't expect to get lower returns on those capital, though I may spend less capital. Does that help? 
Brad Olsen: Yes, that's great color. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of J.R. Weston of Raymond James. 
J.R. Weston: I just wanted to kind of touch back on LPG exports. You were talking about it a little bit earlier, just kind of thinking about the volatility in commodity prices recently, especially the drop in crude prices, and maybe if that has created any more opportunities for you to move spot butane shipments across your LPG docks. 
Joe Perkins: You are correct. We've had very steady appetite for butane shipments and we've done quite a bit. I expect that interest to continue. If we sort of talk about the moor across our export dock, I can't get much more across our export dock right now. I'm so proud of our people just lining up, managing the logistics, making space for our customers, term customers and short-term customers, exceeding our expectations, as we just reported, relative to effective capacity. And we export butanes, we export -- provide export services for HD-5, provide export services for low ethane propane. I'm just happy we haven't -- with all of the low ethane propane going across the dock, we really didn't have to cannibalize the butane or HD-5, and their interest in getting that capacity continues. 
J.R. Weston: Just kind of switching gears a little bit and just thinking about the fact the U.S. is really going to have a glut of refined products here in the Gulf Coast that they need somewhere to go to. And just maybe your color on how you're looking at additional petroleum logistics opportunities, maybe more middle distillate, residual fuel or distillate export opportunities at Patriot or Galena Park. Patriot maybe has a little better proximity to some producing fields and existing customers, so I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on that. 
Joe Perkins: I agree with your view that there are likely to be additional opportunities from our existing facilities on the East Coast, West Coast. We see that we have not been involved yet in exports, though we have helped move it around the country, so to speak. The Patriot dock project with Noble really disclosed all that I'm comfortable with because of the important work we're doing with that customer, but it is positioned to have a lot to do with refined products, whether by pipeline or shipped with the right dock. That's really about all I would say about it right now. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni of UBS. 
Shneur Gershuni: Just wanted to do a couple follow-ups to some of the earlier questions. I guess starting with some of the comments that you made about guidance. Maybe I'm paraphrasing a little bit but when you did the $80.80 and then $60.60, when you went down to 60, I'm assuming or paraphrasing rather, that you had sort of made some volume assumptions based on the lower commodity environment. Yet, you kind of still have a mid-single-digits kind of volume growth number. I was wondering if you can sort of give a little bit of detail on how you get there, which basins you're seeing volumes go up, other basins where you're thinking volumes go down. And is that still consistent, given the barrage of E&P companies that have been cutting CapEx? Were you sort of anticipatory of them basically hitting some of those regions and so forth? So I was wondering if you can sort of talk about that volume number a little. 
Joe Perkins: Okay. December 10, I think it was. We attempted to provide our best estimate based on close customer contact to that time, consistent with a $60.60 world, and what we said was low single digit, not mid-single-digit, resulting from our best estimate of that world, pro forma with Atlas, where we weren't as detailed as we were with Targa but where we did share information and perspectives based on their latest conversations with producers. Are we perfect on that? I doubt it, certainly not when you get to per basin, but I still think it's a pretty reasonable assumption. 2015 and remember, that was 2015 relative to fourth quarter 2014. I think it's still a pretty good estimate and we'll be a lot smarter as we actually see what happens. And that had built into it, what are producers are doing in the first half and what did we think they might do in the second half and we'll get a lot smarter about that as well. Now in terms of some directional indicators of how we got to that low single digit, without going into the numbers for each of those basins, it would be a really good assumption to assume that if we rank order them, that the Permian Basin had the best performance in the group, relative to cutbacks by producers, knowing of course there will be less wells drilled. Having some insight to where they might be drilled, that was the best. The area I worry the most about, I mentioned in the previous answer, is North Dakota, who's getting hit both by lower prices and a differential issue. Fortunately for Targa, for 2015, we've got -- I hate to give it a nickname but some backlog volumes. Backlog in that when that plant comes on next week, knock on wood, or I'm going to get really frustrated because I'm already frustrated, it will help several producer customers put out players. The cast is just either flaring or the whole well is shut in because they can't flare anymore, waiting for that plant. We're also waiting for some right of way from the Indian reservation, and that can be a source of frustration, but that's a backlog of volumes. We also have a backlog of crude volumes waiting for some connections currently being trucked that are dedicated to us when we can get there. So that mitigates it a bit, but that's the one that's kind of on my most worried list and we try to be conservative about what we thought that would look like as we put together those December. A lot has changed since December, but as we put together those December numbers. Somewhere in the middle of that would be North Texas and Oklahoma. South Texas, kind of in that same area code. Is that helpful? 
Shneur Gershuni: Yes, no, that's very helpful. And maybe as I think a follow-up to some of the questions I think Brad had asked, we've sort of -- everybody's been sort of been focused on what are the synergies in terms of cost savings between Atlas and Targa combined and so forth and I recognize we have to wait and see until you get in to be able to fully be able to sort of outline that. But I was sort of thinking along the lines of there are a lot of G&Ps, some of your peers have reported already or sort of indicated a need to do some major cost overhaul and restructurings. Obviously, in your fourth quarter results, we saw some change to your long-term incentive plans. I was wondering if that's something that you're aggressively pursuing now. Is that something we'll see going forward? Do you need to wait for the close of the deal to just sort of execute and so forth? I was wondering if you can sort of give us some color on how you are going to further manage or potentially manage cost. And do you have the same opportunity as some of your peers? 
Joe Perkins: There were several pieces to that question I was trying to get in order of what I wanted to talk about. First, let's start with do we have the same opportunities as some of our peers. I don't know if it's a problem or an opportunity but what we have is 2 very well positioned companies, both of which short of people, okay? Now the good news is we got high talent in both companies, so the priorities were mostly getting covered but we were short of people. Now we may not hire as many as we thought prior to the price shock and we now have the advantage of being able to recruit talent and say, "Do you want to live in Tulsa, or do you want to live in Houston?" And we will look at those open positions very carefully, but this is not a headcount reduction exercise by any stretch of the imagination. It's just the opposite. We think in this downturn, we will add selected talent from those people who were laying off folks, not necessarily their laid-off employees but the employees who don't feel sort of good about to ship their own when they saw other people getting laid off. I really believe that's where we are in my outlook for '15 and '16. If it goes on longer than that, everybody's reassessing. That's a good thing. But the cost savings opportunities are significant. When we announced the deal, we announced it with $20 million to $30 million, right, $20 million to $30 million of synergies. Our Targa philosophy on things like that would be rather to underpromise and overdeliver. Matt will speak up but the ultimate realization just on interest rates associated with redoing the Atlas debt, gets you 1/2 to 2/3 of that. There are lots of different ways we can save the dollars. So we'll overdeliver on $20 million to $30 million, but what we won't be doing -- and we've obviously saved some significant multiple public company costs. There won't be any Philadelphia or New York overhead, I'll let you all go figure out how much that was. That might be a way to save a good bit as well. So we get certainly more than the $20 million to $30 million estimated, but I'm not going to be bringing to investors and I know you might like to have it. How much are we losing on price, how much are we making up on cost savings, what was our original synergy, what was the stuff we didn't know about? I can absolutely guarantee that the stuff we know about, the stuff we suspect and the stuff we haven't found will be a whole lot better than the $20 million to $30 million. You know what? We need a whole lot better than $20 million to $30 million because prices are kind of clobbering us right now. But that G&P business is only part of our business, call it half of ship [ph] our business, and the other side isn't being impacted very much. That's the big benefit of diversity and scale. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal of Global Hunter Securities. 
Sunil Sibal: A lot of my questions have been addressed already but I had a couple of housekeeping items, first of all. On the noncash incentive plan reduction that you benefited from in the fourth quarter, I was kind of wondering, your SG&A fell about $15 million sequentially. So how much of that $15 million involved that noncash investment expense savings? And then how should we think about SG&A going forward? 
Joe Perkins: First let me answer part of the question that I just forgot from the previous question, and then Matt might be able to give you a way to think about it going forward. We did not restructure our LTIP plans, those LTIP plans remain unchanged. What happened was our equity suddenly was priced much lower, and that flows through the accounting for it, as you know, we have to do. So I didn't want anyone to think we restructured the LTIP plans. I think our LTIP plans are market, provide the long-term incentives that investors want to have for the employees who benefit from that LTIP plan. It is hopefully getting a lot of them thinking like owners and that's how we need to think going through the price cycle as we are. Matt, do you have anything else to add? 
Matt Meloy: No, that's it. I'd say the change that you saw in the fourth quarter was related to the LTIP plans or the delta was related to the price of basically NGLS and TRGP, not a restructuring. And that makes up the lion's share, and that was actually -- there was some offsets going the other way, some increase and some other overhead costs. 
Sunil Sibal: Okay, so basically what we can do is see the delta and kind of project it with the prices on the [indiscernible] TRGP and NGLS, I guess? 
Joe Perkins: Yes, I think you could from a modeling perspective. 
Sunil Sibal: Yes, well, that's helpful. And then I think you touched upon this quarter, there was a $10 million take or pay kind of makeup fees. Any particular segment that, that is directed towards? 
Matt Meloy: That's both in our Gathering and Processing and in our downstream business. It was not, as Joe Bob mentioned, it was not LPG exports but there was some small amount underneath our take or pay and our fractionation and then some volumetric take or pays on the Gathering and Processing side. 
Joe Perkins: When we say take or pay, we're doing that with kind of term of art. It's a reservation fee. 
Matt Meloy: Or a volume. It's a full family of those. 
Joe Perkins: Yes. On the -- so no one jumps to the wrong conclusion, that's kind of a modest amount of shortage on the Gathering and Processing in those particular contracts which I'm not going to get into. And for the most part, our customers are above their take or pay levels in the fractionation business with some being below. We don't plan for more than that notional 90% take or pay level. And those who didn't get there pay us cash for not doing so, instead of paying us for the volume that made up that 90%. But still, that's should not be viewed as any indication that we're not highly utilized in the fractionation business. 
Sunil Sibal: Okay, that was helpful. And then lastly, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about M&A environment in the current situation and how are you guys thinking about that post closing of the APL acquisition, and any particular type of asset sets which may be more opportunistic for your guys. I think you mentioned about dislocations leading to opportunities, and I was wondering that's probably more organic versus M&A. 
Joe Perkins: Never want to think of M&A instead of organic. We look at M&A also. Though our organic will be done consistent with our customer needs and capital efficiently. My experience in cycles like this is the first things that really pop up tend to be smaller and bolt-ons. And when I talked about opportunities associated with the price dislocation, we're looking for those. Likely to be smaller, very interested in bolt-ons, can take advantage of perhaps someone's need to sell where we can tuck it into our now expanded asset base. Later in the cycle, we know that there'll be some larger things available. Targa's in a good position to look at it, but we'll look at it with the same kind of rigor we always have. And no, I don't have any particular new strategy on what to look at. It sort of starts by making sense with our existing asset base in our wheelhouse of the businesses that we're currently running. And sometimes, we look at larger stuff that has more of that in the package. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jerren Holder of Goldman Sachs. 
Jerren Holder: I just have one quick one. We saw another Michigan company mention renegotiating some contracts for Evergreen T&F, terms that were underwater. Any opportunities for you guys when you think about some of the legacy fractionation contracts? 
Matt Meloy: We have some portion of our contracts that haven't been -- that were under long-term contracts that haven't been renegotiated at current prices, but most of our contracts have been renegotiated over the last several years. So I'd say there are some opportunities for that, but the lion's share of our fractionation contracts have been redone relatively recently. 
Joe Perkins: Yes, we don't have much coming to term. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Edwards with Crédit Suisse. 
John Edwards: I want to come back to your comment about the 2008, 2009 playbook. And so I'm just -- if you can give us a little better idea on the kind, maybe the percentage savings you were able to get in that environment. And I'm assuming from what your other comments, that shows up not so much on the G&A line but actually in the operating expense line is that -- so if you could answer those 2 questions real quick. 
Joe Perkins: Sure. I think I'm going to regret having said the playbook, but the reality is that's what our area manager said. I had as soon as the note went out, but after the end of the first year, he said I already pulled out my notes from 2008, 2009. And another one said, I've got the playbook, I'm sharing it with others. I am so -- I perhaps don't filter enough. I am not prepared to give you a percentage. I understand why you're asking the question. At the time, I was talking primarily where the rubber meets the road for us out in the operations with our area managers on both the G&P side and the downstream side. During running-gunning times, you start paying premiums to keep up with your customer needs and things cost more. We will be saving significant dollars from our suppliers, our vendors, contract labor, our own overtime labor, okay? Products and materials will get meaningfully cheaper. We've already had proposals and some of those proposals we've asked to be reduced on things like chemicals, okay? Oil is the primary component and an excuse for increasing it and it's cut in half, you can imagine that we can get a pretty significant reduction in chemical cost, for example. For engine oil, okay, that's a pretty easy negotiation to get back to, and we use a lot of it. You said how much, and I'm not giving you how much, but the G&A, I kind of talked about. Some of it, we don't have work for, okay? It goes away because Philadelphia and New York go away. We aren't trying to get rid of headcount G&A. The normal public company costs of 2 other companies are kind of a freebie for us. We will be keeping a separate set of financials for some outstanding note holders. That's not hard to do and not very costly. Making it public style to the extent we do for equity is much worse. 
John Edwards: Okay, that's helpful. So then the other question, you sort of tapped around the guidance question. So just to confirm, so the mathematical interpolation from your December guidance, that still holds, is that a fair read through on your comments? 
Joe Perkins: Yes, it's hard for me to confirm how people are doing the mathematical interpolation, but yes, it's reasonable to come to those conclusions that at that 50 and 5, linear interpolation would tell you that we might go to 0.9x coverage. Well, we're even below that right now, so you might have... 
Matt Meloy: On prices. 
Joe Perkins: We're even below that on prices. We're not -- we're way above -- I think we've shown that we can do high coverage in higher price points. So yes, we're going to be dialing the coverage dial. We don't want to go much below 1.0, but we're not scared to have 0.9 to 1.0 and we need to -- but we also need to look out over multiple years in terms of what is the expectations of price and therefore, the expectations of level of activity and the expectations of volumes in our G&P business as we make those decisions embedded in that early December guidance was levelized. I'm not sure we have the expectation of levelized yet. 
John Edwards: Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess the other question is I mean, you spoke a little bit about the Bakken. So maybe I'll just come back to that to clarify. Obviously, there's a lot of flaring going on there. So in terms of, say, buffering the volumetric impacts, are you getting a fair amount of buffer there? And so perhaps while you say you worry about it, is it perhaps not as challenging as it would otherwise be? Is that -- maybe just a comment on that. 
Joe Perkins: The buffer helps in the short term, okay? But only for the short term and we're all trying to figure out what the longer term is. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Legas [ph] of Challenger Capital. 
Unknown Analyst: It is actually Jon Keani [ph]. I just want to make sure I understand the message that you were trying to give to people with your comments about the prior sensitivities in guidance and outlook that you all had given in December and also taking into consideration some of the changes that you highlighted as well. Were you trying to say that it's important for investors to think about the distribution growth profile of the company to more of a longer-term fashion and be a little less focused on the near term? What were you trying to get across to people? I wasn't completely clear, please. 
Joe Perkins: Okay. Sort of absent exactly repeating it again, I really was trying to... 
Unknown Analyst: You don't have to do that, I just wanted to make sure... 
Joe Perkins: I was only trying to get across to people that we are going to be looking at it over the long term like we always look at it over the long term. When we make our distribution decisions, we do so with a multiyear view, looking at multiple scenarios that are likely with the best possible inputs we can get at the time. And sharing that with our board use that multiyear scenario and the ability to cushion with coverage to try to drive our distributions and therefore, our dividends, as smoothly as possible. I think we've got a pretty good track record of doing that. And so I took the December 10 which provided some information of how we saw the world at that time and our best estimates, and try to repeat how we're going to always think about our quarter-by-quarter distributions and therefore, dividends with a multiyear view. That's all I was trying to get across and I'm not trying to imply anything else. 
Unknown Analyst: Okay. And then as far as the producer volumes are concerned, you made some comments about producer volumes. And what's your sense on how that's trending? Is it just difficult to ascertain right now? Or what are your thoughts on it? 
Joe Perkins: Yes. I think it is difficult to ascertain. I've got many producer friends, many producer customers that I have the conversations with. So I'm generalizing and I don't want to offend anyone by generalizing, but the first half is a lot clearer than the second half because the second half will be more impacted by the actual activity levels that they're doing, call it, in the second quarter. And then those activity levels in the second half will impact how we feel about '16. And many of them, whether they're admitting to it or not, have their own version of multiple plans because the price outlook is so uncertain, and I use that term outlook broadly. When they break to the middle of the year, their outlook will be influenced by their own interpretation of supply and demand and what it's looking like and will look like by the forward curves and what that's telling them. By their own leveraged position, broadly, producers want to be living within their cash flow right now. So that's the difficult calculus. It's large in uncertainty as through any cycle we've seen, but we're also really early in the cycle. 
Unknown Analyst: Right, that makes sense. I think I see what you're saying. And last question I have is, back to your comments about smooth distribution growth, you all have obviously worked hard to make sure that you have a strong balance sheet. And I think in the past that obviously, really had -- probably hadn't been something that was too much of a consideration considering the direction that was moving in. Over the next 12 to 24 months, is there a little bit more focus on that and how you decide and the board decides where the distribution should grow? Or do you feel that that's moved so far in the right direction that it's really just more about coverage? 
Joe Perkins: First of all, I know we had a very long call, okay, trying to provide a lot of that information, correct some mistakes that might be made out there about what our leverage looked like and what sort of liquidity we had, and it will also be in the record for everybody to look back at. That's important. We managed our balance sheet very, very carefully and I think, very conservatively. The way we've done that in the past isn't going to change in the future. And similarly, we try to manage our coverage on the equity side carefully and conservatively. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Matt Niblack of Hite Asset Management. 
Andy Gupta: This is actually Andy Gupta. A question about the vote coming up next week. I guess, how confident are you in that vote going forward? And have you had any calls from shareholder groups at TRGP expressing any dissatisfaction with the deal? 
Joe Perkins: I'm very confident in the TRGP vote. Anyone who's been involved in deals like this knows I get to see them. 
Andy Gupta: Okay. I guess, any comment on the second part of the question? 
Joe Perkins: Have I gotten any calls from shareholders? No, I have not recently. We made a concerted effort to try to address all natural questions of people with energy portfolios and the price dislocation, major shareholders with our position beginning with the price shock when interest really went up, and after the first of the year as people were thinking about the upcoming vote. I'm hoping we've addressed all those questions publicly at conferences or one-on-one. All we're doing is just pointing to publicly available information to say here's how it's going to work and why we're very confident and my very confident that's been there from day 1 is even more very confident. 
Andy Gupta: Understood. And one other question is, you'd earlier made comment about buying compressors, displacing lease compressors as you think about capital plans. Can you just elaborate on that a little bit more? Why don't you use that CapEx for your other projects or save that? Are you expecting that much of a return on the CapEx for the compressors? 
Joe Perkins: Yes I don't mind describing it but I'm going to describe it generally and not by any particular vendor. We've always in growth mode in almost every area operated with a owned and leased portfolio. The leased allows you to manage variability. Compressors get moved around within fields. Targa has 2 of its own compressor refurbishment shops, so we have spares. And having a spare to instantly put back in when something goes down is an infinite return, it's the right use of capital. Our replacement of leased compressors, let's say, I was buying some for the future and certainly not don't need them this fast, but I don't have to create a large inventory. I just get rid of a leased compressor. And I also approach, when I have a couple in my pocket, I will tend to approach all of my vendors for lower terms on these sort of evergreen not termed, but just month-to-month compressors. And if I don't get a lower rate, guess which one I replace? It's not complicated. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan of Citigroup. 
Faisel Khan: I'll just keep it quick. I just had a question on the hedges for 2015. On a pro forma basis, you said that roughly 40% of your volumes are POP pro forma for the transaction. Going forward, can you just give us a little bit more idea of what the -- how much of that volume is hedged again on a pro forma basis for '15 and at what price? Or did I miss that in the press release? 
Matt Meloy: No. You'll see our hedge schedules, we will put it in our K when we file it. It will be out today. Atlas is going to be having theirs out, so it will be towards the end of the month. We didn't give you the pro forma numbers, we gave you our standalone. It was 55% hedged in '15 on gas and 45% hedged on condensate, 12% on NGLs. Atlas has their hedges disclosed on their last 10-Q. Again, it will be updated when their K is filed here recently. They do have more hedges than us on the natural gas side. 
Faisel Khan: Any reason why on the preview guidance, only 12% of your NGLs are hedged for '15 and why not more of it? 
Joe Perkins: I mean, as we've described to investors for some time, Targa -- hindsight's 20-20 -- has been less hedged on LPGs because of our perceived upside versus downside, but more so our internal view shared with our Board of Directors, that a large portion of that volume being ethane is essentially getting natural gas price. And secondly, our propane which is the next largest volume, as you know, call it to the nearest 10%, 20% that the propane piece of this has an interesting offset relative to our opportunities for propane exports. So I would not call it a natural hedge. Understand that, that would be an imprecise term but directionally, it is a directional offset. And then it's a function of just how much do you have of one or the other. It's the reason we're more likely hedged on propane. 
Faisel Khan: And that 12% assumes... 
Joe Perkins: By the way, that's why Matt says the best way for you to think about hedging is we'll be hedged at least as much as the sum of the parts when you put Atlas and Targa together. Probably more so for the combination but not thinking about it dramatically differently except to make sure that we stay disciplined. 
Faisel Khan: Okay, and then the 12%, that means that includes the assumption of ethane being rejected across your system too, right? 
Matt Meloy: Yes, we take that into account. It's an estimate. It doesn't change it too much. 
Joe Perkins: And we talked about this before. We can reject in some of our newer plants. The propane penalty is generally too high to reject in some of our older facilities, and so we're actually -- we're managing that every day to watch it. But even if it's not rejected, okay, it's near gas pricing, okay? 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Helen Ryoo of Barclays. 
Heejung Ryoo: Just some quick items. So on CapEx, you provided a preliminary number. Just wondering if there's any wiggle room to reduce that preliminary 2015 CapEx if needed during the year. And then the second question is if you add in Atlas' CapEx, and my sense is that there's not -- with the new Buffalo plant that got pushed out in Permian, doesn't look like there's a whole lot of spending at Atlas planned for '15, but could you provide some sort of an estimate on a pro forma basis? 
Joe Perkins: I'm not comfortable providing the estimate on the pro forma basis. I will instead, give color that I think is helpful. We've taken -- early in January, we came out with guidance that showed that CapEx might be that 60% to 80% of the previous numbers and we showed you where the primary ranges were on our investor presentation. It's still out there and when you say more if needed to, what that range is reflecting is our smart delay in downsizing associated with what is necessary to meet the customer needs. And back to other questions, we'll get adequate returns for that, as good a returns for that. It's a reasonable assumption and it's a reasonably informed assumption on my part that Atlas does not look that different. I happen to understand the delay in the Buffalo plant pretty well. There hasn't been that much money spent, and it going slower makes a lot of sense. In fact, if it's going slower and then suddenly prices pop up and Pioneer needs volumes faster, the new merged company is going to be able to help them because we can pipe it all together and get it to High Plains, which currently has capacity available. That's just the benefit of having more assets and having what will soon be a super system in the Permian Basin. So CapEx will be reduced to what is necessary to meet our customer demand and that will naturally occur project by project, some of which will be visible to you. 
Heejung Ryoo: That's helpful. And then on the Longhorn and the High Plains plants, are you -- what is the utilization of those plants? Is it possible to give out an expectation when those plants would fill up? Or given the uncertainty on the producer side, that's a little bit difficult to talk about? 
Joe Perkins: It's a little difficult to say when it fills up. I do want to take a step back and say, do you remember that both of those are now parts of multi-plant systems. It also is our newest plant, so I tend to put more volume to them because it gives me better control of that ethane rejection, but they were put into systems that were full and have importantly contributed to our ability to handle volumes, including volumes all the way from Sand Hills across the Midland pipeline, if that's helpful. And know, in terms of when they might fill up, I was a little concerned about our North Texas -- not concerned, starting to plan for what's next in North Texas, that's been slowed down a little bit, for example, by just that current activity levels. And then in the Permian, our combined portfolio, the Atlas plant delay is reflective of slower-than-anticipated producer drilling, and that will work nicely with the rest of the Targa portfolio. 
Heejung Ryoo: Okay. And then just lastly, on the LPG export volume you reported for this quarter, does that include any short spot volume or, I don't know if you would call it noncontracted volume? 
Joe Perkins: I can assure you, we have no noncontracted volume going across the dock. We do have some shorter-term contracts and we aren't disclosing the mix of that. Though I think we provided information that we contracted for more across 2014 for 2014 and for multiple years. 
Operator: And with no further questions in queue, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Joe Bob Perkins for any closing remarks. 
Joe Perkins: Thank you very much, operator. Thank you for all of your patience. I know we had longer prepared remarks to try to help with your questions, and we are happy to have helped with the long list of questions. If you have any other questions, feel free to give me a call, Matt a call, Jen a call. We appreciate your interest. Good day. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Have a great rest of your day.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-11-04 10:30:00) =====
Executives: Chris McEwan - Senior Manager, Finance Joe Bob Perkins - Chief Executive Officer Matt Meloy - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Brad Olsen - TBH Schneur Gershuni - UBS Darren Horowitz - Raymond James John Edwards - Credit Suisse Jerren Holder - Goldman Sachs Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Targa Resources’ Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Webcast and Presentation. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Chris McEwan.
Chris McEwan: Thank you, operator. I'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter 2014 investor call for both Targa Resources Corp. and Targa Resources Partners LP. Before we get started, I would like to mention that Targa Resources Corp., TRC, or the Company and Targa Resources Partners LP, Targa Resources Partners or the Partnership, have published their joint earnings release, which is available on our website www.targaresources.com. We will also be posting an updated investor presentation to the website later today. Speaking on the call today will be Joe Bob Perkins, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Meloy, Chief Financial Officer. Other management team members are available for the Q&A. Joe Bob and Matt are going to be comparing the third quarter 2014 results to prior period results as well as providing additional color on our results, business performance and other matters of interest. I would like to remind you that any statements made during this call that might include the Company’s or the Partnership’s expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Please note that actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings, including the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. With that, I will turn it over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Chris. Welcome and thanks to everyone for joining. Following our customary format, I'll start off with a high level review of our third quarter 2014 performance highlights. Then Matt will review the Partnership's consolidated financial results, segment results and other financial matters for the Partnership. He'll also cover key financial matters related to Targa Resources Corp. following Matt's comments, I'll provide some concluding remarks, then we'll take your questions. Obviously, we've had some important announcements since last quarter, including TRP's execution of a definitive agreement to acquire Atlas Energy L.P., and TRP's execution of a definitive agreement to acquire Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P., also our successful completion of an $800 million 4.125% senior notes offering. Although Matt will discuss the senior notes offering in more detail, I want to say that the enormous demand that we saw for the new issue and year-to-date record yield for a callable high yield note is reflective of the confidence that the debt markets have in the Targa story. And also, I want to point to our press release announcing Board approval for two additional processing plants, one in the Delaware Basin and one in the Williston Basin. Because this is our first public opportunity to really discuss the new processing plants, I want to provide some additional color on the new plants during my concluding remarks. Now the primary focus of this call is third quarter performance, but I will provide a brief update on the Atlas transaction here in the introduction. We completed and submitted our initial HSR filings on October 24th and I am very happy to report that this morning we received verbal notice that we have received early termination, so very good job for those people who worked on that filing. We expect to file our proxy at TRC soon, perhaps within a couple of weeks from now, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2015. As we said on the day of announcement, we are very enthusiastic about this strategic transaction and continue to believe that it’s a great deal that benefits all equity holders. We understand and appreciate your interest and natural questions on the topic. But for additional information on the transaction, we need to point you back to our transaction announcement presentation and to a replay of that conference call. Both of those are available on our website. And we can point you forward to the public documents soon to be filed with the SEC that will contain additional information, including financial outlook information. Now that wraps up all that we plan to say about the Atlas transaction. So let’s turn now to third quarter performance highlights. It was a very good quarter. Our reported third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $247 million was 58% higher compared to $156 million for the third quarter of last year. The Logistics and Marketing division operating margin was 75% higher and the Field G&P segment operating margin was 39% higher than the third quarter of 2013. The Logistics and Marketing division produced quarterly operating margin of $180 million, primarily driven by higher LPG export activity and higher fractionation activity. The last piece of the Phase 2 expansion was the addition of another de-ethanizer at Mont Belvieu which we completed in early September. Our other phase 2 capabilities, including pipeline dock and additional refrigeration, were added earlier in 2014. The added capabilities from our new projects helped drive record LPG export volumes which were 273% higher than the third quarter of 2013. As you probably recall, Phase 1 of our international export project began loading a few test ships with low ethane propane for the first time since September of 2013. The margin increase in Field Gathering and Processing was primarily driven by: significant contribution increases from Badlands compared to the third quarter of 2013, experiencing large increases in both crude gathered and natural gas gathered and processed; and the margin increase was also driven by higher natural gas inlet volumes across all of our other field systems. Our distributable cash flow for the quarter of $193 million resulted in distribution coverage of approximately 1.5 times based on our third quarter declared distribution of $0.7975 or $3.19 on an annual basis. The Partnership’s third quarter distribution represents a 9% increase compared to the third quarter of 2013. If we look at the TRC level, the third quarter dividend of $0.7325, or $2.93 annualized, represents a 29% increase compared to the third quarter of 2013. Now that wraps up that my initial comments and I'll hand it over to Matt.
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Joe Bob. I'd like to add my welcome and thank you for joining our call today. As mentioned, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $247 million compared to $156 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily the result of higher LPG export activity and fractionation activity in our Logistics and Marketing division, a higher contribution from Badlands and record natural gas inlet volumes and gross NGL production in our Field Gathering and Processing segment. Overall, operating margin increased 48% for the third quarter compared to the same time period last year. And I will review the drivers of this performance in the segment reviews. Net maintenance capital expenditures were $20 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared to 16 million in the third quarter of 2013. Based on the year-to-date spending, we’re updating our 2014 net maintenance CapEx to be about 80 million for the full year. Turning to the segment level, I’ll summarize the third quarter's performance on a year-over-year basis and we will start with our Gathering and Processing segment. Field Gathering and Processing operating margin increased by 39% compared to last year driven by higher natural gas inlet volumes, higher crude oil gathering volumes and higher gross NGL production. Third quarter 2014 natural gas plant inlet volumes for the Field G&P segment were 953 million cubic feet per day, an 18% increase compared to the same period in 2013. The overall increase in natural gas inlet volumes was due to increases in all the field business units, 149% at Badlands, 26% at SAOU, 16% in North Texas, 9% at Sand Hills and 8% at Versado. We benefited from full quarter contributions from our plants completed in the second quarter, the High Plains plant in the Permian and the Longhorn plant in North Texas. Crude oil gathered increased to 99,000 barrels per day in the third quarter, an 89% increase versus the same time period last year, highlighting our continued progress in North Dakota. For the Field Gathering and Processing segment, natural gas prices increased 14% while condensate prices decreased 17% and NGL prices decreased 4% in the third quarter '14 compared to '13. Turning now to the Coastal Gathering and Processing segment, operating margin decreased 9% in the third quarter compared to the same time period last year primarily driven by lower throughput volumes at LOU and the Coastal Straddles. For this segment, natural gas prices increased by 12% and NGL prices were flat compared to the third quarter of '13. Next I’ll provide an overview of the two downstream segments starting with the Logistics Asset segment. Third quarter operating margin increased 68% compared to the third quarter of 2013 driven by higher LPG export and fractionation activity. For the quarter we loaded an average of 6.3 million barrels per month of LPG exports, benefiting from previous completion of aspects of our Phase II export expansion plus completion of the final piece of the expansion completed in early September and from continued high international demand for propane and butane. Fractionation volumes increased 16% versus the same time period last year driven by a full quarter for CBF Train 4 which was still ramping up during the third quarter of 2013. In the Marketing and Distribution segment, operating margin for the segment increased 90% over the third quarter 2013 due primarily to higher LPG export activity. With that, let’s now move to capital structure, liquidity and other matters. As of September 30th, we had 575 million of outstanding borrowings under the Partnership's 1.2 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due 2017. With outstanding letters of credit of 42 million, revolver availability was 583 million at quarter end. Total liquidity, including approximately 72 million of cash on hand, was about 655 million. At quarter end, we had borrowings of 238 million under our 300 million accounts receivable securitization facility. Through September, we received approximately 257 million of net proceeds from the asset market equity issuances which we continue to be very pleased with the success of this program. Although we may take an advantage of other equity offering sources, we expect to continue to use this program to meet our equity needs. Total funded debt on September 30th was approximately 3 billion or about 55% of total capitalization and our third quarter compliance debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.7 times. On October 23rd, we priced 800 million of senior unsecured notes due in November 2019 at par to yield 4.125. We used the net proceeds to reduce borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and reduce borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility. After giving effects to the offering, our pro forma liquidity as of September 30th was approximately 1.5 billion. Since the closing of the notes offering, we had issued a redemption notice for the 250 million of outstanding principal amount of our [7.875] notes, the total cost of the redemption is approximately 260 million. As Joe Bob mentioned, we’re very proud of the issuance because our notes are the lowest yielding callable bonds issued in the high yield market this year and among the lowest in the history of the non-investment credit market. For the third quarter of 2014 our operating margin was approximately 72% fee based. Based on current hedges in place, including some entered into since the end of Q3, we estimate that we have now hedged approximately 50% to 60% of our current natural gas equity volumes for 2015 and approximately 20% to 30% for 2016. If we have significant ethane rejection for those years, we will be towards the bottom of those ranges. For condensate, we have hedged approximately 45% to 55% of the current equity volumes for 2015 and approximately 25% to 35% for 2016. With this hedge position and our large fee-based operating margin contribution, Targa is well positioned for near term commodity price weakness. And we estimate the following sensitivities for Targa’s 2015 EBITDA relative to current prices: a $5 drop in crude price would decrease EBITDA by approximately $3 million for full year 2015; a $0.05 drop in the weighted average NGL price would result in an approximate $12 million reduction in EBITDA for 2015; and a $0.25 drop in natural gas price would result in an approximate $5 million decrease in EBITDA for 2015. So now moving on to capital spending, we continue to estimate approximately 780 million of gross capital expenditures in 2014. So now turning over to Targa Resources Corp, I’ll make a few brief remarks about the results of TRC. Targa Resources Corp standalone distributable cash flow for the third quarter 2014 was 31 million and TRC declared approximately 31 million in dividends for the quarter. TRC declared a cash dividend of $0.7325 per common share or $2.93 per common share on an annualized basis, representing an approximately 29% increase over the annualized rate paid with respect to the third quarter of 2013. As of September 30th, TRC had 92 million in borrowings outstanding under its 150 million senior secured credit facility and 6 million in cash resulting in total liquidity of approximately 64 million. That concludes my review. And I will now turn the call back over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you, Matt. Certainly a very good quarter. We are now more than 80% through the year and we have demonstrated strong reported performance through three quarters. We expect this performance record to continue through the fourth quarter and beyond. We continue to benefit as our attractive organic growth projects come online and contribute to EBITDA. At the beginning of the third quarter we completed Phase 2 of our international export expansion. And as Matt said, we also had full quarter contributions from our Longhorn and High Plains G&P projects. We were able to export 6.3 million barrels per month during the third quarter. I am very proud of our ability to increase our export service capabilities beginning first with butanes and HD5, then with the construction and ramp up of Phase 1 which started up only a little over a year ago and then incorporating each phase of the second expansion throughout 2014. Our ability to export propane and butane has exceeded our expectations year-to-date and is a testament to Targa’s employees doing a great job in many areas, including engineering, project management, operations, trading and marketing, logistics management and customer service. We continue to see a lot of demand for our propane and butane export services and we’re continuing to add contracts and contract link. We are also pursuing export opportunities for ethane. The market is continuing to develop as evidenced by a variety of announcements including companies building ships to service the expected market need. We have a viable ethane export project and continue to have high interest and discussions with a variety of customers. Our strong quarterly performance in our Field G&P segment is indicative of continued high levels of producer activity around our areas of operation supported by the capacity additions of our High Plains and Longhorn plants. Although there has been considerable discussion about the decreasing crude prices over the last month or two, and we're certainly watching prices and investor research and media reports about the impacts just as all of you are, we are also reminded that Targa is very well positioned to handle lower prices with resilience given our strong financial position and given locations in the best oil basins in premier liquids rich gas gathering basins in the country. That is also the case pro forma for the Atlas transaction. We are also in consistent dialog with our producer customers on their expectations for forward rig activity, expected future wells drilled and resulting volumes which we use with some natural conservatism to develop our own forecast for activity and volume growth. What we hear from them, producers are of course being cautious and thoughtful relative to current price levels in the recent fall. Some have said that they couldn’t slow down immediately due to rig, sand supply and other commitments. Others have said that they expect to maintain current levels of activity, but may not increase those activity levels as much as recently planned. Some have said that they are moving rigs from one basin to another due to better economics. That is usually to our advantage, sitting in the best basins and some of the best parts of the best basins. So far, we haven’t really seen any slowing down. We anticipate that with lower than anticipated prices, producer cash flow relative to their leverage may impact activity for some producers in some areas. And of course we’ve all read articles about and seen previous evidence of how producers will use any slowdown to extract mitigating cost reductions from their service providers. While we will obviously continue to monitor the situation, we are not currently expecting dramatic impacts to our 2015 volume outlook, either on the Field G&P side or on the downstream side. And as I said, Targa and Targa pro forma the Atlas transaction, is well positioned to manage lower prices given our strong financial position and given our locations in the best basins in the country. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, one of the exciting announcements that we made since last quarter were our additional expansion plans in the Delaware Basin and the Williston Basin, two of the most economic basins for drilling in the world. These expansions were approved based on our view that activity will continue in these areas of operations near-term and longer-term, even in a commodity price environment similar to what we are experiencing today. We approved construction of a new 300 million cubic feet per day cryogenic processing plant ahead of pipeline originating at the new plant into the heart of the southern portion of the Delaware Basin and related gathering compression infrastructure. That new plant will be located in Winkler County, Texas, west of our existing Sand Hills gas processing plant, to provide additional midstream services to producers on the western side of the Permian Basin. The size is indicative of our view of the potential for additional captured volumes in the area and we have engineered it such that we benefit from plant economies of sales while still having relatively efficient lower volume startup capability. The addition of the plant will increase our standalone Permian Basin capacity to a total gross capacity of nearly 1.1 billion cubic feet per day. It expands the capacity for the Sand Hills system and to some extent increases future capacity for the interconnected SAOU system which is currently processing Sand Hills volumes coming across our Midland County pipeline. The new processing plant in the Delaware Basin is expected to be operational at the end of the first quarter 2016. We’re thinking about calling it the Joyce Johnson plant. We've got to get permission first. In the Williston Basin, we expect our 40 million cubic feet per day Little Missouri Train 3 expansion to be completed by the end of 2014 and in service early January, subject to the completion of one Oak's 8 inch NGL pipeline which may be delayed until the first part of 2015 and we know they're working very hard on it. We also approved the purchase of a 200 million cubic feet per day cryogenic processing plant that will also be located in McKenzie County and will increase our total effective processing capacity to approximately 300 million cubic feet per day. Producers continue to improve their performance in the Williston Basin and in our part of the Williston Basin with better oil wells and even more gasoline produced than we expected only one or two years ago. We’re continuing to work together to reduce the amount of natural gas being flared in North Dakota. The additional Badlands plant is expected to be operational as early as the end of 2015 or perhaps early 2016. Understanding that many of you are focused on the incremental CapEx of the two new plants and their related infrastructure investments, I would say that although preliminary, the total incremental CapEx over time for the two is somewhere around 600 million and the expected returns are attractive, especially in the Badlands. Regarding some of our other major announced growth projects, Train 5 remains on track to be completed in mid-2016 and we have filed the air permit for the condensate splitter project at our Channelview Terminal. As for completion timing on that project, we expect end of '16, perhaps beginning of '17, depending on the permitting timing. Customer interest and demand for additional midstream infrastructure remains strong and we continue to make progress on the $2 billion of projects that we have shown currently under development. So, we certainly had a busy third quarter and our forward-looking plates appear as full as our plates of the recent past. Before we open up the line to questions, I get to take this opportunity to thank our employees for another great quarter performance, for continuing to safely and effectively execute on our daily operations and commercial activities despite very high activity levels, and I am proud of the continued excellent service that our customers are receiving. With that, let's open up the line to questions, please, operator.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Brad Olsen from TBH.
Brad Olsen - TBH: I had a question really kind of on the competitive dynamic along that you’ve been Ship Channel obviously we’ve seen one of your larger competitors buy out one of the larger lessors of acreage along the Ship Channel. And I was really just curious if you believe that consolidation is going to have any impact on Targa’s plans to potentially participate in ethane or condensate exports around the Ship Channel going forward?
Joe Bob Perkins:  I didn’t find that a particularly surprising deal and I don’t think that those in the industry did either, good deal for them but I don’t see it impacting the competitiveness of the Houston Ship Channel for propane, ethane, LPG, butane exports.
Brad Olsen - TBH: And so I guess there have been rumblings out of the producer community that it felt as though it’s putting a lot of export capacity in the hands of one party. But your thought is that it doesn’t effectively change the competitive dynamic and that there is kind of sufficient competition to keep a robust competitive atmosphere in that area?
Joe Bob Perkins:  I think the two competitors performing that export service are pretty darn competitive.
Brad Olsen - TBH: I realize that you guys did give quite a bit of color around both the Badlands expansion and the Delaware Basin plant. I just wanted to see if I could dig a little bit deeper and maybe just kind of get a qualitative understanding of the agreements or the producer requests that led to the announcement of those plants. Was it producers in those respective areas contacting you about a shortage of processing capacity, were they plants that you’ve been working on for a certain period of time? And I guess really I understand that you guys are very low in the kind of North American cost curve in terms of where rigs are going to continue to operate. But just trying to understand better, are these plants going to be servicing volumes that are going to be generated by kind of a flat rig count or are these plants anticipating an increase in rig count in their respective acreage dedications, if you could provide a little bit of color around that.
Joe Bob Perkins:  Sure, let me separate them for a little bit more color for you. Starting with the Permian, we’ve been working on a project like that project for some time as almost everybody knows Sand Hills was full. And we look towards helping Sand Hills we first created the Midland pipeline and are processing gas for the Sand Hills system over at SAOU at our High Plains plant, that allows us to continue the contract but ultimately that’s a short-term solution because of the growth at SAOU. The plant on the Western side of the Sand Hills system allows us to better access it hydraulically puts us in a superior position for serving the far Western high development area. I think one time we said publicly there is no doubt we’re going to put a plan out there, it’s just a question of whether the 200 million a day or 300 million a day plant economies of scale to get between the 200 and 300 are not much and that shows our strong belief of the continued long-term development potential in the area. It will be serving both dedicated acreage for existing customers and contracts that we’re currently working on, but we feel very good about the potential for that plant. You go to North Dakota and that new facility also a little bit upsize due to economies of scale is just trying to keep up with our existing customers and existing dedications and their oil wells being much better than original it’s been reasonably anticipated and more gas from those oil wells than even recently anticipated. When you think of that is really serving just our existing customers. So little bit different, do not require increases in rig counts, think of it as benefiting from existing levels of rig counts and benefiting even more so if rig counts increase in the area.
Brad Olsen - TBH: And you mentioned that the returns are attractive and I assume that’s kind of in line with your historical 5 to 7 times guidance on the G&P investments you make?
Joe Bob Perkins:  I understand, yes I did say attractive and I said even more so in North Dakota without pointing to the 5 to 7 times which is kind of a narrow band I would say it falls on the more attractive side of historical.
Operator: The next question comes from Schneur Gershuni from UBS.
Schneur Gershuni - UBS: See a couple of quick questions here. In your concluding remarks you sort of talked about potential for shifting economics to be potentially a beneficial outcome for you, kind of given how the producers could change their footprints with respect to the declining environment. I was wondering if you sort of step back and think about your pro forma footprint. Kind of what percentage of your geographic footprint benefits versus the areas, just wondering if you could just sort of can expand on that a little bit?
Joe Bob Perkins: We are in the two best oil basins in the United States. And maybe not in the perfect sweet spot in North Dakota but we’re in one of the sweet spots in North Dakota. In the Permian Basin we currently have three attractive footprints within the Permian Basin that benefit from some of the most active and I guess you’d have to therefore assume most economic for producer’s portions of the Permian Basin. That certainly is, Brad calls it the cost curve. Yes, relative to the producers cost curve that’s a good place to be. And North Texas system has continued to have more focus; these are I guess producers without a Permian footprint more focused development but volumes have been increasing there. When we first brought up the new plant we actually were able to turn down one of the trains at the Chico facility to test it out. We now have both trains at the Chico facility running as well as the new plant and we’re at kind of high percentage utilization. So volumes are increasing in North Texas, it’s not as attractive on the cost curve as those areas of the Permian Basin, but it’s still increasing volumes. For field GMP North Dakota, Permian Basin and North Texas it’s hard to point to where you would rather be. So I think you benefit from those positions.
Schneur Gershuni - UBS: So it’s fair to conclude that basically a majority of your pro forma with Atlas assets are basically kind of where the producers will ultimately end up and are less likely. So is that fair to conclude from those comments?
Joe Bob Perkins: I wasn’t addressing the Atlas assets and I point you back to what we said about leading basin positions and leading positions within those basins pro forma for Targa in our comments at the time. And I don’t feel any differently about it today.
Schneur Gershuni - UBS: As a follow up question you mentioned the ethane export potential. Does the recent change in global oil prices in Naphtha and how we think about ethylene margins so forth? Does that change the conversation or does the fact that ethane just continues to collapse, kind of continue to support an ongoing dialog. I was wondering if you can sort of give us a little clue into the mindset of who the potential shippers would be?
Joe Bob Perkins: It doesn’t appear to have changed the dialog.
Schneur Gershuni - UBS: And then one final just clarification, these sensitivities you gave earlier in the call with respect to commodity pricing that was for standalone Targa that does not include in pro forma Atlas. Correct?
Joe Bob Perkins: Correct.
Operator: The next question comes from Darren Horowitz from Raymond James.
Darren Horowitz - Raymond James: Joe Bob, just a quick question on refined product export. Obviously the Patriot Terminal has got good proximity and some flexibility for that just based on the producing fields. And we’ve heard some announcements recently from competitors. I am just curious has the level of interest with regard to the discussions that you guys are having increased significantly? Whether or not it’s gas oil or naphtha or even more aggressively refined products? I would imagine that could be a big opportunity for you and a nice piece of vertical integration to bolt onto this system.
Joe Bob Perkins: Interest in dealing with exportable condensate.
Darren Horowitz - Raymond James: Sure, or further refined products.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes condensate through splitters and other refined products is pretty high. Lots of people are trying to impact the rules and influence the rules over time. We have some well positioned facilities on the East Coast, the West Coast and the South Coast that maybe working on those projects in the future.
Darren Horowitz - Raymond James: And then follow up question, just with regards to your comments around propane and butane exports across your existing docks. Is there any consideration at this point for additional products possibly propylene, isobutylene? Do you think there is an arb between normal and isobutene and we could see some of that? I am just curious to how you see the evolution of those assets over the next 12 to 18 months with all the commodity price volatility that we’re seeing?
Joe Bob Perkins: Our Galena Park facility is pretty well committed for butane, propane and potentially ethane. We do small amounts of cargos, ethylene for example from there as well. I don’t see a major ramp up on the other products in the near-term. However, we’ve got other facilities that can’t be entertaining such possibilities.
Operator: We’ll move on to the next from John Edwards from Credit Suisse.
John Edwards - Credit Suisse: Just appreciate some of the color you’re providing on the impact of commodity prices. I’m just curious diving a little deeper there, how say you’re seeing that perhaps impacting your opportunity set or if you’re seeing say a shift in that opportunity set at all? And if you can maybe comment a little bit regarding that sensitivity perhaps.
Joe Bob Perkins: We aren’t yet seeing a shift in our opportunity set, I think all customers are being thoughtful and cautious but interest is still high in those development projects that you have visibility on.
John Edwards - Credit Suisse: So you’re not seeing any decreases, sounds like you’re not really seeing any increases either. Is that fair to say?
Joe Bob Perkins: I think that’s fair to say, the interest remains about the same, people are being thoughtful and cautious and this is a recent short-term move that’s being digested by those customers. Comments I made about producing customers or probably similar to the way downstream customers are thinking about it.
John Edwards - Credit Suisse: And then on the new plants you’re announcing, are those 100% fee based?
Joe Bob Perkins: The new North Dakota plant is 100% fee based; the new Permian West Texas plant will have a mix of field POP and fee based. Our existing customers will be POP; new customers will probably be a mix of POP and fee based.
John Edwards - Credit Suisse: Can you talk about kind of what the percentage mix is there?
Joe Bob Perkins: No.
John Edwards - Credit Suisse:
Operator: The next question comes from Jerren Holder from Goldman Sachs.
Jerren Holder - Goldman Sachs: Just wanted to start off with I guess LPG exports and obviously throughout this year you guys have benefit a lot from the short-term or spot contracts. What are some of your expectations I guess going forward just given the lower commodity prices, more volatile environment, your recent expansion online which are back by long-term contracts? And then maybe some of the competitor expansions that are scheduled to come online as early as the first quarter of next year and throughout 2015?
Joe Bob Perkins: Two or three quarters performance has been very strong and pretty far end of the fourth quarter and know that the fourth quarter will be a well performing export performance as well. I expect that performance to continue into 2015. The tendency for analyst to look at the visible arb and quite volumes to that arb is not showing a strong correlation during times when the arbitrage has gotten more narrow, we’ve added contracted cargoes, and we’ve added shorter term contracted to cargoes in the third quarter, and I can say that for the fourth quarter and the first quarter as well. Despite what seems to be a smaller arb as published or discussed due recognize that you don’t have all the moving pieces on what’s an economic transaction. There is term transportation for example; it may be at a lower price than spot transportation. Needs of term market probably means that they need to go ahead and get supply. And then you have an advantage position of our facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast relative to Latin America and the Caribbean and the transportation cost term transportation costs or spot transportation costs were significantly lower to those markets. I expect that those dynamics don’t look a whole lot different in ‘14 than they do in ‘15, demand and interest remain high.
Jerren Holder - Goldman Sachs: And then again maybe switching to the Bakken, obviously there is concern the lower oil prices and I recognize that McKenzie County is one of the core areas of the Bakken. But I guess can you maybe touch on just what the current natural gas flaring opportunity is there that would probably support some of the projects that you’ve laid out?
Joe Bob Perkins: My existing customers would probably say that they wish that the plant that’s coming on by the end of this year was owned faster. The plant we’re done to try to have on by the end of next year is highly needed. We’re trying to do everything we can to work on the flaring, fact is the oil wells are better and there is more gas from those oil wells than people originally anticipated. So I think of it as an opportunity and a task to get our arms around the flaring issue.
Operator: The next question comes from Danilo Juvane from BMO Capital.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital: As a follow-up to the LPG export question, is there a way that we can think about sort of the weighted average down track length that you have on those facilities inclusive of the expansion that just came online?
Joe Bob Perkins: We made some announcements in the second quarter and all we’ve said since then is, more term and more contracts.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital: Is there a sort of percentage of total capacity that we can sort of…
Joe Bob Perkins: These contracts are multi-year contracts; some of them go up to five years or so and even beyond. It's a mix, but these are multi-year contracts.
Operator:  And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Joe Bob. 
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you operator. Thank you to everybody for your interest. Please feel free to contact any of us, if you have further questions and have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference for today. Again thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a good day.

Analysts: Edward Rowe - Raymond James Jerren Holder - Goldman Sachs Brian Lasky - Morgan Stanley Faisal Khan - Citigroup Justin Agnew – Robert W. Baird Jeremy Tonet - JPMorgan Helen Ryoo – Barclays Michael Blum - Wells Fargo Chris Sighinolfi - Jefferies
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Targa Resources’ Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Jennifer Kneale. Please go ahead.
Jennifer Kneale - Director, Finance: Thank you, operator. I would like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2014 investor call for both Targa Resources Corp. and Targa Resources Partners LP. Before we get started, I would like to mention that Targa Resources Corp., TRC, or the Company and Targa Resources Partners LP, Targa Resources Partners or the Partnership, have published their joint earnings release, which is available on our website www.targaresources.com. We will also be posting an updated Investor Presentation to the website later today. Speaking on the call today will be Joe Bob Perkins, Chief Executive Officer; Rene Joyce, Executive Chairman; and Matt Meloy, Chief Financial Officer. Other management team members are available for the Q&A. Joe Bob and Matt are going to be comparing the second quarter 2014 results to prior period results as well as providing additional color on our results, business performance and other matters of interest, including revisions to our 2014 financial outlook. I would like to remind you that any statements made during this call that might include the Company’s or the Partnership’s expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Please note that actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings, including the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. With that, I will turn it over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins - Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Jen. Welcome and thanks to everyone for joining. For our customary format, I will start off with a high level review of our second quarter 2014 performance highlights. Then Matt will review the Partnership’s consolidated financial results, its segment results and other financial matters for the Partnership. Matt will also cover key financial matters related to Targa Resources Corp. Following Matt’s comments, I will provide some concluding remarks that will include an update on our 2014 financial outlook and our outlook for growth capital projects and expenditures. Then Rene would like to say a few words about the second part of the press release concerning management changes and will add his perspectives on the business outlook. Then we will take your questions. Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $226 million as compared to $126 million for the second quarter of last year. Yes, the financial reporting accountants assure me that it really does round to $100 million as an increase over the second quarter last year. This 79% increase was driven by record quarterly operating margin in the Logistics and Marketing division and record quarterly operating margin in the Gathering and Processing division. Logistics and Marketing operating margin was 104% higher than the second quarter of 2013 and the G&P division operating margin was 42% higher. The Field Gathering and Processing segment produced operating margin of $98 million representing an increase of 45% versus the second quarter of 2013. This margin increase was primarily driven by the combination of a number of factors, including significantly higher oil and gas throughput volumes and significantly higher year-over-year contribution from Badlands. Continued strong producer activity and increased throughput in other field gathering and processing areas and just beginning to benefit from the startup of commercial operations at our 200 million cubic feet per day Longhorn plant in North Texas in May and our 200 million cubic feet per day High Plains plant at SAOU in June. The logistics asset segment produced quarterly operating margin of $109 million, up 108% compared to last year, primarily driven by higher LPG export activity and higher fractionation activity. We benefited from additional capacity from our Phase 1 expansion at Galena Park export facility completed last September and from increasing operational capabilities as we continue to complete stages of our Phase 2 expansion over this year. In the first quarter we completed a new pipeline between Mont Belvieu and Galena Park. Early in the second quarter at Galena Park we added refrigeration and completed construction of another dock capable of handling VLGCs. The last piece of the Phase 2 expansion is the addition of another de-methanizer, at Mont Belvieu which will be completed in the third quarter of 2014. Operating margin from our marketing and distribution segment was 95% higher in the second quarter of 2014 than the same time period last year, primarily as a result of the increase in LPG export activity. Our distributable cash flow for the quarter of $175 million resulted in distribution coverage of approximately 1.4 times based on our second quarter declared distribution of $0.78 or $3.12 on an annual basis. The partnerships’ second quarter distribution represents a 9% increase compared to the second quarter of 2013. We look at it at the TRC level the second quarter dividend of $0.69 or $2.76 annualized represents a 30% increase compared to the second quarter of 2013. It was a very good quarter. And since our last call I am happy to say that S&P recently raised our credit rating for the partnership to BB+, one notch below investment grade. Before I pass it to Matt, I want to thank Rene and Roy on behalf of the management team and to thank them on behalf of our investors as these two men retire at the end of the year we all owe them a lot for the legacy they helped create a target. Speaking personally, it has been an honor and a privilege to have worked with these two men for the last 12 years or so. I also want to thank Jim Whalen for returning to the role of Executive Chairman of both boards along with the rest of the executive team and all of Traga’s senior leadership. Jim and I are proud to continue the Targa legacy. That wraps up my initial comments and I will hand it over to Matt.
Matt Meloy - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Joe Bob. I would like to add my welcome and thank you for joining our call today. As mentioned adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $226 million compared to $126 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily the result of higher LPG export activity and fractionation activity in our logistics and marketing division, a higher contribution from Badlands and higher volume throughput in our gathering and processing division. Overall, operating margin increased 64% for the second quarter compared to the same time period last year. I will review the drivers of this performance in the segment review. Net maintenance capital expenditures were $19 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared to $19 million in the second quarter of 2013. Turning to the segment level I will summarize the second quarter performance on a year-over-year basis and we will start with the gathering and processing segment. Field gathering and processing operating margins increased by 45% compared to last year driven by higher natural gas inlet volumes, higher crude oil gathering volumes and higher natural gas and NGL prices. Second quarter 2014 natural gas plants inlet volume for the field gathering and processing segment were 903 million cubic feet per day, a 13% increase compared to the same period in 2013. The overall increase in natural gas inlet volumes was due to increases in each of the following business units, 87% at Badlands, 23% in North Texas, and 14% at SAOU. Inlet volumes at Versado and Sand Hills were essentially flat versus the same period last year as a result of some operational issues, but we expect growth going forward. And as you probably know Sand Hills is essentially full, but we are taking steps to provide additional short-term and longer term capacity to handle significant activity in and around the system including a previously discussed new pipeline now called the Midland County pipeline connecting to SAOU’s new High Plains plant. Versado was also seeing significant producer activity and growing volume and has available processing and treating capacity for that growth. As mentioned our Longhorn plant in North Texas began commercial operations in May and our High Plains plant in SAOU began in June. Producer activity in North Texas and especially the Permian Basin is exceeding our previous expectations of volume growth. Crude oil gathered increased to 84,000 barrels per day in the second quarter, a 119% increase versus the same time period last year and highlights our continued progress in North Dakota. For the Field Gathering and Processing segment, NGL prices increased by 12%, natural gas prices increased by 9% and condensate prices were essentially flat in the second quarter of 2014 compared to the second quarter of 2013. Turning now to the Coastal Gathering and Processing segment, operating margin increased 31% in the second quarter compared to the same time period last year. The increase in operating margin was a result of new volumes with the higher GPM at VESCO, including volume from Shell’s Mars B development in the Gulf of Mexico and from higher GPM volume at Lou. For the segment, natural gas prices increased by 14% and NGL prices increased by 2% compared to the second quarter of 2013. Given that NGL production has been 16% higher for the first half of the year, we are revising our expectation for coastal NGL production and we now expect coastal NGL production to be higher in 2014 versus our previous estimate that NGL production would be approximately flat to 2013. Next, I will provide an overview of the two downstream segments. Starting with the logistics asset segment, as Joe Bob mentioned in his opening remarks, second quarter operating margin increased 108% compared to the second quarter 2013 driven by higher LPG export and fractionation activity. For the quarter, we loaded an average of 4.8 million barrels per month of LPG export. We benefited from high international demand for both propane and butane, particularly from Central and South American markets. Fractionation volumes increased by 35% versus the same time period last year driven by the addition of CBF Train 4, which commenced commercial operations during the third quarter of 2013. In the Marketing and Distribution segment, operating margin for the segment increased 95% over the second quarter 2013 due primarily to higher LPG export activity and higher NGL marketing activity. With that, let’s now move to capital structure, liquidity, and other matters. As of June 30, we had $495 million of outstanding borrowings under the Partnership’s $1.2 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due 2017. With outstanding letters of credit of $95 million, revolver availability was about $610 million at quarter end. Total liquidity, including approximately $67 million of cash on hand, was about $678 million. At quarter end, we had borrowings of $234 million under our $300 million accounts receivable securitization facility. Through July, we have received approximately $180 million of net proceeds from At-The-Market equity issuances and we continue to be very pleased with the success of this program. Although we may take advantage of other equity offering sources, the At-The-Market program appears to be sufficient to meet our equity need. Total funded debt on June 30 was approximately $3 billion or about 55% of total capitalization and our second quarter compliance debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.8 times. For the second quarter of 2014, our operating margin was approximately 67% fee-based. Moving on to capital spending, we now estimate approximately $780 million of growth capital expenditures in 2014. The changes to our updated capital expenditure estimates are as follows. The inclusion of spending in 2014 related to construction of Train 5, a 100,000 barrel per day fractionator at Mont Belvieu and additional CapEx to support continued strong producer activity across our field areas of operation. We also updated our list of major capital projects under development and now have over $2 billion of projects in various stages of development in addition to the $2.6 billion in announced projects that are ongoing or recently completed. The major changes to the list are the inclusion of additional fractionation and a potential ethane export project. Next, I will make a few brief remarks about the results of Targa Resources Corp. Targa Resources Corp’s standalone distributable cash flow for the second quarter of 2014 was $29 million and TRC declared approximately $29 million in dividends for the quarter. On July 15, TRC declared a second quarter cash dividend of $0.69 per common share or $2.76 per common share on an annualized basis, representing an approximately 30% increase over the annualized rate paid with respect to the second quarter of 2013. As of June 30th, TRC had $87 million in borrowings outstanding under its $150 million senior security credit facility and $9 million in cash, resulting in total liquidity of approximately $72 million. Given the strong EBITDA performance as a partnership, we expect our pretax distributable cash flow to continue to exceed our 27% cash tax guidance estimate for the second half of 2014 and for the rate to approximate the first half of the year. That concludes my review and I’ll now turn the call back over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Matt. I’ll start with the summary of our outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect volumes to exceed earlier estimates in our G&P division. In our Field G&P segment, producers remained extremely active across all our areas of operations. Sandhills capacity limitations as Matt mentioned had been persisted by the near-term addition at the Midland County pipeline, connecting Sandhills to SAOU with more capacity plans with the Sandhills area in the works. Versado was expected to fill faster than initially forecasted. And our Badlands operations continue to exceed our 2014 expectations. And we are likely to see natural gas volumes continue to increase as we support our producer customers in complaint with North Dakota’s updated flaring restrictions. In our Coastal G&P segment, we’re benefiting from additional higher GPM volumes that were not included in our initial forecast for 2014 and as Matt said, we now expect 2014 NGL production to be even higher than 2013. Our downstream businesses are performing very well on all fronts especially with respect to our export services. During the second quarter of 2014, at Galena Park, we added refrigeration or pumping capacity and completed another doc ahead of schedule as part of our Phase II international export expansion project providing incremental capacity and operational efficiencies for effective capacity. Our people also did a great job installing and ramping up the equipment and learning how to effectively operate increasing capacities on the play. Phase II is expected to be fully completed in the third quarter of 2014 with the addition of a de-ethanizer at Mont Belvieu. Once complete, total effective export capacity for Targa will be approximately $6.5 million barrels per month of propane and/or butane, those of you watch our export capability numbers closely, we’ll notice that this new effective capacity is larger than our previously published 5.5 million to 6 million barrels per month. With our effective capacity revised higher as we became more comfortable with our operational capabilities. The outlook for export services is robust and we continue to see high levels of activity and are benefiting from strong demand for our services. Since the first quarter, we continue to add contracts as well as contract length. That leads us to a revised financial outlook. Given our strong performance through the first and second quarters of 2014, across our businesses and the very positive outlook for business performance for the rest of the year, we are revising our financial outlook for the year. We are now estimating 2014 adjusted EBITDA with a range of $925 million to $975 million based on what we see today. With respect to our partnership distribution growth expectations for 2014, we are clearly on track to be on the high end of our original 7% to 9% growth expectations. At the TRC level, we can say that we’re very confident with our original expectation that dividend growth will be more than 25% for 2014. Moving to the status of our major growth projects as Matt mentioned earlier, we’re now including Train 5 in our capital expenditure estimates for 2014. We are board approval and have started construction. Train 5 should be completed in mid 2016 and expect – and is expected to cost approximately $385 million. Given the strong activity in our Field G&P segment, the majority of Train 5 capacity will be utilized to fractionate Targa volumes, and the rest will serve third-party volumes under booked existing and future fractionation service agreements. Earlier this year, we said at the timing and nature of additional fractionation at Mont Belvieu might be dictated by volumes coming from the Utica Marcellus via the proposed Utica Marcellus Texas pipeline joint venture between Kinder Morgan and MarkWest. That is still the case if UMTP is a go, then the need of UMTP shipper customers will impact the timing and the specifics of the fractionated designs for Train 6 and potentially Train 7. Similarly, if UMTP does not go in the near future other growing customer needs will determine timing and fractionated design. As Matt mentioned earlier, additional potential fractionation is now included in our list of major capital projects under development. And we are also now including the potential ethane export project on the list. Engineering is complete for another dock in de-methanizer to support potential ethane project, and discussions are ongoing with several potential customers that are interested and having another ethane export provider located in the Houston ship channel. So that list of major capital projects under development now has more than $2 billion worth of projects. We are in the process of finalizing the permit details for our approved 35,000 barrel per day condensate splitter at channel view and expect to file those during the third quarter. Those permits although we understand why outside the interest is very high and we’re getting questions about it, our splitter project is not impacted by the US commerce departments, private letter rulings in June 2, 2014 on the export of process condensate from two projects in the Eagle Ford. There are logical advantages and robust markets for the byproducts of condensate splitters positioned on the US Gulf Coast. And we continue to see demand for additional potential splitter projects associated with our facilities. We continue to put continue to work in North Dakota on attractive projects building out of our crude and natural gas gather in systems. We believe that the next 40 million a day plant in the Badlands, we call it Little Missouri 3, maybe completed by yearend, subject to weather and regulatory approvals. But we’re hopeful. We’re already considering additional gas plant after Little Missouri 3. And we continue to identify and pursue other smaller oil and gas projects in the Badlands. In the Permian Basin, producers continue to grow volumes and require additional infrastructure around our assets to support their efforts. Not yet approved and not on our announced approved list yet, another 200 million cubic feet a day Permian plan could be a near term approval and within new from the under development list to the approved list. Clearly 2014 has already been another big year for Targa. I’m incredibly proud of the performance of our employees this year, and I’m excited about our opportunities for continued strong Targa performance during the rest of the year and beyond. Now I’d like turned over to Rene.
Rene Joyce - Executive Chairman: Thanks, Joe Bob. As you may have seen in our press release this morning Johnson and I will be retiring at the end of this year. Although remain a director of both boards. Roy and I have been involved in the midstream industry for more than 45 years and are exiting at a time when the opportunities to grow a company in this space have never been greater. For the first time in our carriers we believe this will be case for very long time. The employees at Targo exceptional and they‘re managing assets and businesses that are ideally situated the capture these opportunities. In closing, Roy and I came up with the idea to start a midstream company and early 2002. And one of the most important steps we took that ultimately created all this value was to quickly team up with five great individuals in Warburg Pincus. Together as a team and with some luck from doing all this during the shale revolution we were able to create a great company. On behalf of Roy and I, we want to thank them for the support friendship. And I look forward to still playing role in this amazing story as a director. With that let’s open the line for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Edward Rowe from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Edward Rowe - Raymond James: Hi, good morning, guys and congrats on the quarter. A quick question on the LPG exports with strong spot LPG export demand and we are seeing huge builds in pad 3 on propane inventories could beat the ethylene cracker outages, but when you think about outside the guidance, is this the case where you guys are able to lock additional long-term contracts at good rates or you are seeing significant spot shipper demand through 2014.
Joe Bob Perkins: We are seeing significant demand of both pipes through 2014. What we said today that since first quarter when we gave you some numbers about it we have continued to add contracts and we have continued to add contract term reflecting that strong demand.
Edward Rowe - Raymond James: Okay. I appreciate that. And when you think about how do you balance between having the option value, having spot contracts versus getting some longer tenor contracts given the outlook on further LPG expansions, how do you guys kind of weigh that balance?
Joe Bob Perkins: It’s probably more than balancing that. We have been increasing capacity nameplate capacity, increasing effective capacity. It’s difficult to term that up until you have already proven it’s there. And we are working within a conservative operational constraint to make sure that we can deliver on term contract requirements. We are not trying to balance spot option availability. We are contracting up rapidly and we are taking advantage of the markets to try to move as much as we can through increasing capability.
Edward Rowe - Raymond James: Okay. I appreciate that and kind of just switching gears, with your asset footprint in the Permian while most of them are within some of the oiler part of Permian we are seeing some growth in condensate in a portion of the Permian, do you see any opportunities around maybe stabilization given your exposure within that area and that’s all I have? Thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: Go ahead Mike.
Mike Heim: This is Mike Heim. We have got discussions going on with several producers that are interested in stabilization and movement of the condensate out of the Permian to the Gulf Coast for splitting and export. So we are still working those angles but like Joe Bob said before we see a demand for the finished product after the split here on the Gulf Coast.
Joe Bob Perkins: I should also add for folks who don’t know we have stabilizers and have had them at many of our plants already and sometimes you are running them and sometimes you are modifying them, so.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jerren Holder from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jerren Holder - Goldman Sachs: Good morning. Just want to start off wishing Rene and Ray the best on their retirement. Also if we could probably get a little bit more perspective on ethane exports, kind of the key points maybe being discussed with the customers in a potential size, scope, etcetera anything any additional perspective.
Rene Joyce: Yes. And I will kind of refer – this is Rene. We will refer back to where we stood with LPG exports. We were way behind enterprise both in terms of timing and capabilities, but over time we have developed the very nice long-term business around LPG export. And we find that’s ourselves in that situation today with ethane exports as Joe Bob said in his comments the engineering is complete for de-methanizer and additional export facilities for ethane. We are in conversations with a number of parties what’s very encouraging besides number of parties. We see water borne market for ethane developing much smaller than LPGs but it is developing for ethane. So we are optimistic that we can create a business long-term business around ethane exports.
Jerren Holder - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you. And if you can provide some color maybe on the utilization levels that some of the newer plants you put in service in May and June, how are they ramping up and where are they sitting right now?
Joe Bob Perkins: I understand the focus on the utilization of the new plants, but I want to take a step back. The cool thing about both of those new plant that they are part of systems and even super systems now and they are the newest most efficient plan in those systems and super systems. So, it’s natural for us to move some volumes to them. The outlook for North Texas and the outlook for the Permian, SAOU plus Sandhills is for volumes to be increasing even faster than we thought at the beginning of 2014 and that’s the big picture. And then we’ve taken that outlook, our multiple scenarios about what’s going to happen across Field G&P and put that into our revised financial outlook for 2014.
Jerren Holder - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. And lastly, I guess if you could provide some perspective on your views on NGL prices, I think some of the E&P companies out there have had a bearish view kind of going forward, especially if you look at the export announcements and what to expect to come online for LPG in next year, what your thoughts on kind of NGL prices outlook?
Joe Bob Perkins: I try not to be the NGL price forecaster. And our business in many ways is insensitive or we get positives on one side of price movement and offsetting negatives on the other side of price movement. And that’s a good position for target to be in. Our look for original guidance you recall what that pricing look like. We did multiple price scenarios including current prices as we updated 2014 financial guidance. You won’t see Targa claiming to be a bear or a bull relative to the current spot markets for LPGs, natural gas, or condensate.
Jerren Holder - Goldman Sachs: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Lasky from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Brian Lasky – Morgan Stanley: Hi, good morning. A quick question, Joe, already talked about a little, but in terms of the implications of frac buys on your MOU with Kinder Morgan. Could you go into a little bit of detail there about the MOU you have between yourselves and Kinder Morgan and MarkWest, is there a certain amount of capacity you need to keep for them at some point or is that very much where you guys are still in the drivers’ seat in terms of moving quarter of that.
Joe Bob Perkins: I don’t want to go into detail about things that I’ve got CAs about. Our capacity, Train 5, Train 6, potentially Train 7 is available to meet the needs of customers from the Northeast, via the Kinder Morgan pipeline and we stand ready to make that capacity available. The announcement of Train 5 is a Train 5 of particular design and we are beginning to build it immediately, saying that we need most of it for our target volumes, but that – that will also serve third-party volumes under existing and future contracts. The potential for Northeast volumes would change the design of the next fracs going on potentially significantly, is it a propane plus stream or is it a propane plus little bit of ethane stream and that would determine the design for which we would permit to meet the needs of shippers on the Kinder Morgan pipeline. That project is not go forward. There is an awful lot of demand from other parts of the country and the design of the next Train beyond Train 5 would probably look more like Train 5 which has a good bit of flexibility already. So, I hope that answered your question. We see demand for fractionation being pretty robust. I think the price we used in the script was that the potential go forward of Northeast liquid coming this direction would impact timing and design, but there is still a lot of demand.
Brian Lasky – Morgan Stanley: You guys are in the driver’s seat in terms of whether or not you move forward on Train 6 alone or is your ability to move forward contingent on anything else with that JV or go into that at all.
Joe Bob Perkins: With respect to our friends at Kinder Morgan, You said that twice.
Brian Lasky – Morgan Stanley: Okay.
Joe Bob Perkins: I will work with them and the going forward is 6 or 7 is likely to go forward with or without volumes coming from their pipeline from the Northeast.
Brian Lasky – Morgan Stanley: Got it. And then just over back on the condensate splitter front, wonder if you guys can just elaborate kind of on your thoughts about incremental splitter opportunities and how you guys may weigh that against potentially getting in the condensate export side of things and how you’re positioned there?
Joe Bob Perkins: We believe our facilities are nicely positioned for multiple commercial activities. Right now, we are and that’s what we said in the beginning involved in discussions with several counterparties interested in the particular location and benefit that our facilities bring for condensate splitters to the ship channel and those byproducts coming off of condensate splitters to robust markets for them at the ship channel.
Matt Meloy: Yes. This condensate splitter that we are designing is going to generate six products. A lot of those products have a robust domestic market. Some of those products will be ideally situated for export. And that’s the same thing we are hearing from the customers we are dealing with. These splitters can be designed around the quality of the condensate coming in and again as domestic and international markets for these products.
Joe Bob Perkins: At the same time, I think that there will be condensate exported. And I am not saying we will participate in that to have to be split on the other side of the water, that’s not – that’s the way it just sort of goes, demand for both types.
Brian Lasky – Morgan Stanley: Thank you. That’s all I have.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Faisal Khan from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Faisal Khan - Citigroup: Thanks. Good morning. It’s Faisal from Citigroup. Just a few questions. I think you talked a little bit about this on the call, but the sequential sort of increase in the first quarter to second quarter in the fractionation volumes, I guess from sort of 312 to 346, can you go into a little more granularity in terms of what drove that sequential increase?
Matt Meloy: Yes. I mean, we saw – part of it was just from our Field Gathering and Processing plant, so….
Joe Bob Perkins: And Q4 was ramping up.
Matt Meloy: Yes, Q4 was ramping up, but this is Q1 to Q2 and we saw lot of growth just from out in the Permian and from our field production really to go into CVS.
Joe Bob Perkins: Sorry.
Faisal Khan - Citigroup: Okay. So that volume increase….
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, Q1 to Q2 we just continued increased from not only our volumes but also third-party volumes.
Faisal Khan - Citigroup: Okay, okay understood. And then just going back to the spot cargos for LPG facility in the quarter, are most of these spot cargos have X ship or FOB?
Joe Bob Perkins: They are all FOB.
Faisal Khan - Citigroup: All FOB, okay. Okay, it makes sense. And then as you are looking at the sort of a proposed ethane facility, ethane export facility, how important do you think it is to be sort of investment grade with these counterparties that you are dealing with? Is it not an issue or is it bit of a sticking point?
Matt Meloy: For the counterparties to be investment grade or for me to be investment grade?
Faisal Khan - Citigroup: For you to be investment grade?
Matt Meloy: I don’t think that I have been one notch below investment grade as a sticking point for those counterparties.
Faisal Khan - Citigroup: Okay, okay got it.
Joe Bob Perkins: I think the most important thing with these parties is the availability of ethane in our system that could supply them over the long-term.
Faisal Khan - Citigroup: Okay, okay. It makes sense. And then just going to more of a strategic question, I guess in your press release, you guys put out last month you talked about you had been in sort of high level discussions with energy transfer. Can you talk about how you guys are thinking about M&A with the company and whether the change is sort of with the retirement of some of the senior management here has anything to, does that have any view or sort of influence on how you are thinking about M&A in the context of the company?
Matt Meloy: Actually, I am glad you asked the question, because Rene, Roy, myself want to quickly dispel any thought that their retirement is linked to those rumors in that article at all. We are managing the company the same way we have for the last 12 years and we are going to manage it the same way in the future with Rene on the board. And I can speak for all of senior management on that. There was rumors. There was an electronic sort of article to the extent that we had to come out with a statement strongly encouraged by the NYSE at the time. That statement said, we have been previously engaged, it was preliminary and high level and the discussions had been terminated. I can assure you that statement was correct. Don’t really have anything else to say today about that statement or that article. Now, you have also kind of addressed a broader M&A question. And first of all, Targa is always looking at potential asset entity acquisitions. Targa acquiring now assets and entity over a wide range of types but we remain disciplined and were not they get frustrated by others of times, sometimes paying too much. We also have fiduciary responsibility to consider any credible offers better incoming. We are focused everyday on improving the long-term value with Targa Resource by doing that management in the boards of the appropriate context to evaluate and incoming offer.
Faisal Khan - Citigroup: Okay. I think that makes sense. I appreciate the clarity.
Joe Bob Perkins: I will just add one comment. There is nothing linking the two, Roy and I leaving with the energy transfer situation. Unfortunately, it’s just a function of age.
Faisal Khan - Citigroup: I understand, understand. Thank you. I appreciate the time guys. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from Justin Agnew from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Justin Agnew – Robert W. Baird: Good morning, guys. Congrats on the strong quarter.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks. Before you asked the question, Rene and Roy are younger at heart than most of the rest of us, so that’s part of why we were laughing.
Justin Agnew – Robert W. Baird: Alright. Are you guys seeing any cost inflation either on the material side or any of the engineering or construction work on any of you projects?
Joe Bob Perkins: I heard on the material side on the engineering construction. I didn’t hear the first part of the phrase. Please repeat…
Justin Agnew – Robert W. Baird: Just any cost inflation on any of that.
Joe Bob Perkins: Cost inflation. There are cost pressures just because there is an awful lot of activity out there. The workforce is the one we’d see kind of the most impact and good news is, Targa is a pretty good at retaining our employees and we intend to try to stay good at retaining our employees. Material costs are going up a little bit. Mike, you got more to ask…
Matt Meloy: I would guess they’re going up less than 7% to 10% per year and we have work with some phenomenal E&C company that have built things on time, on budget and we have great confidence in their continue to support of Targa’s growth and we’re very pleased with what we’re seeing right now.
Joe Bob Perkins: We believe it’s manageable right now but you’re right, there are pressures.
Justin Agnew – Robert W. Baird: Got it. And then when we think about the growth out of the Coastal G&P segment, is any of that due to an uptick in TMS volumes or somewhere else?
Matt Meloy: No, somewhere else is the right answer.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yeah. We’ve seen some growth at VESCO from the Mars B platform coming on volumes going to VESCO and we’ve also had producer customer on-shore Louisiana at Lou, some high GPM volumes there. The second quarter volumes at Lou from that are actually down from Q1 we would expect those kind of tail off.
Matt Meloy: We’ve seen Wilcox volumes come and go along the on-shore Louisiana area that goes to Lou, kind of spurts up and then doesn’t I think we’re going to continue to see gas well gas for the system there, just whether it’s enough to make up for the decline in those volumes.
Joe Bob Perkins: In this growing activity in the off-shore prospect will be hopefully tying into the Mars platform. So there’s sufficient activity that will impact these operations over the next few years.
Justin Agnew – Robert W. Baird: Got it. Thanks for the color that’s it from me.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeremy (Tonet) from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hi, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet - JPMorgan: Hi, good morning and congratulations on the strong beat and raise. Also, best wishes to Rene and Roy going forward. I was just wondering you just one follow up question on ethane exports. I was wondering if you might be able to add any thoughts you might have on the development of the list market and thoughts on is it really just cracker feedstock displacement or could more of this becoming into being used fuel or just any thoughts there on how this (indiscernible) market is developing?
Joe Bob Perkins: Not one go into a lot more detail but our discussions with multiple customers are for multiple markets. I think that ethane to those multiple markets will develop over time. It make sense on a global macroeconomic standpoint and as a develops then lower the cost you don’t have just back-to-back contract. But that’s a multiyear process back-to-back contracts will be what you see first.
Matt Meloy: And multiple uses.
Joe Bob Perkins: Right.
Matt Meloy: Absolutely. There is customers are going to use this to replace their own declining supplies of ethane as a feedstock and there are locations in the world that we work with for other products that are looking at ethane as a strong source of fuel for electric generation.
Jeremy Tonet - JPMorgan: Got it, yes, it seems like that could be a pretty large market potentially. So interesting to see.
Matt Meloy: Mike, I said, it’s developing.
Jeremy Tonet - JPMorgan: Right.
Matt Meloy: And we’re encouraged that it can eventually end up into a sizable waterborne market.
Joe Bob Perkins: The market has to get confident that ethane prices are going to be reasonable and the supplies are going to be there so, they’ve got a significant capital investment in sales and order that create the demand for the ethane.
Jeremy Tonet - JPMorgan: That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Helen Ryoo from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Helen Ryoo – Barclays: Thank you. Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter and congratulations to Rene and Roy. Just a couple of questions so, first on the marketing segment, your margins were sequentially down on – hello.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes.
Helen Ryoo – Barclays: Yes, sorry, you can hear me, right?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, we can.
Helen Ryoo – Barclays: Okay. Your margins were sequentially down on the marketing segment and the volumes were flat, but your LPG exports activity was higher so, I’m just curious why your marketing segment had a sequentially lower number. Is that mostly NGL price driven?
Joe Bob Perkins: One of the first things is the seasonality in wholesale propone. So, I’d say that’s the largest factor. Q1’s usually the stronger quarter for wholesale propane and then Q2, it doesn’t make much.
Matt Meloy: In this Q1, if you remember that had some dislocation associated with pricing that probably made it more…
Joe Bob Perkins: Even better from Q1.
Helen Ryoo – Barclays: Okay, got it. And then just on fractionation so I think – your fractionation volumes were sequentially higher and then I think the press release mentioned some higher reservation fee received. Are you essentially receiving, I mean, just going forward, I don’t know how much excess capacity you have as the frac 4 ramps up, but are you pretty much covered with the reservation fee that the volume should not really matter, you’re getting paid anyway on the full capacity. Is that the right way to think about it?
Joe Bob Perkins: That’s a right way to think about it and that’s what we built into our most of the scenarios of our guidance.
Helen Ryoo – Barclays: Okay. And then frac 5 is that the same thing you’re going to have reservation fee built in there so, pretty much – pretty much immediately you’re going to get fully paid regardless of the actual volume of your frac?
Joe Bob Perkins: You kind of changed the question. Frac 5 is pretty much the same and it will be associated with reservation fees to target in third-party existing contracts or future contracts overtime, then you repaid it and you said pretty much immediately. There will be some ramp-up into Frac 5. There was some ramp-up into Frac 4 as you will recall.
Helen Ryoo – Barclays: Okay.
Joe Bob Perkins: The producers don’t have bottled up capacity to go from zero to whatever the quantity is in. We did have several suppliers that ramped up on trying for some of those came on later in 2013 and the initial volume have came on in mid year ’13.
Matt Meloy: Does that answer your question?
Helen Ryoo – Barclays: Yes, yes, it does. So, it seems like there was a ramp-up carrier for your – in terms of frac 4, you’re at the top of the full payment phase right now and then for frac 5 you’re going to have some sort of a period, but you’re going to essentially got fully paid regardless of the volume movement.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes, over a reasonable period of time, we would expect frac 5 to be similarly kind of 90% utilization from a financial standpoint is a good way to model it.
Helen Ryoo – Barclays: Okay, great. And then just lastly, going to Badlands I guess I mean there was one-off announced the pretty big plans in the Northeast McKenzie County. It seems like it’s pretty closed to where your assets are, but just wondering it’s – you have a big competitor plans in the area, is that good for you given maybe less flaring, it should help the volume coming into your system or does it change your thoughts around maybe more processing in that area. Could you maybe talk about that a little bit?
Joe Bob Perkins: In the Badlands, there are huge acreage dedications. One Oak has more acreage dedicated to them than any of the company. They should because they’ve been there. They go back towards before the Bakken and there is a lot of held by production acreage out there. We don’t really say that we are competing with other companies for natural gas up there for processing because we have significant acreage dedication to ourselves. One Oak is reaching out to try to alleviate the flaring for producers over a wide area. We are looking at any new sources but we have a growing need by the producers under contract with Targa to build additional plants.
Helen Ryoo – Barclays: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Michael Blum - Wells Fargo: Hi, good morning everybody. Rene and Roy congratulations on your time and also I think pretty much everything was covered. I just had couple of one clarification on the LPG export facility, sort of your updated statement of capacity should we think of that sort of a delta there as available for spot or that’s also potentially also getting contracted now?
Joe Bob Perkins: That 6.5 million barrels a months that you heard us describe you should think of as available for spot and term. There is no reason we can’t contract for 6.5 million barrels a month. We speak in terms of an effective capacity which is not the 12,500 barrels per hour times 24 hours times 365 days a year that would be 9 million barrels a month. We can refrigerate and pump 9 million barrels a month of HD-5 propane and or low ethane propane when you add it all up. But when you factor it down for several categories, one, equipment run time and efficiency, okay is that refrigeration always running. Two, docks and ship factors including weather right scheduling and storage and product availability which Targa has a strong advantage in. When you take those three factors, it’s not just about the pumping capacity. And right now based on our experience and using this number for a month, multi-month view we are very comfortable with 6.5 million barrels a month. There will be spots certainly days, weeks and even months that could exceed 6.5 million barrels per month and that might be additional room for spot. Does that help Michael?
Michael Blum - Wells Fargo: Yes. Thank you. My second question is maybe I am reading into this too much, but in your press release you talk about a step change in the growth of EBITDA this year and I certainly wouldn’t argue with that characterization. And I did hear your commentary on where you think distribution growth will end up for the year, but just wondering if you are sort of thinking about a step change in the distribution as well to sort of go and lock step with the EBITDA growth or do you think there is no reason to really go above 9%?
Joe Bob Perkins: You might be reading too much into our step change discussions etcetera. I mean certainly we have had a very large step change in EBITDA that’s 750 million and 925 million and 975 million is the result of things going well across all of our businesses. Distributions have increased as a result of that. I mean we are at the top of that range that we talked about. And we are certainly admitting that we are above the plus on the 25%. But we are also letting with a multi-year view and we always drive this thing with a multi-year view. We are letting coverage go up with that multi-year view and increasing coverages in the short-term to create benefits in the longer term that support higher long-term distribution rates. What we don’t want to do is drive the boat with a whole bunch of steps, right. Ups and then perhaps flats and then more ups, we have got a terrific record of continued increases and continued growth in the increases. And I don’t think you should interpret whatever word was used in step function there to imply that we were going to start driving the boat differently.
Michael Blum - Wells Fargo: Great, understood. Thank you very much guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Chris Sighinolfi - Jefferies: Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for the time.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hey, Chris.
Chris Sighinolfi - Jefferies: Joe, just real quick, CBF 5 you have a estimate cost of 385, I was just wondering is that gross CapEx or is that net for your interest?
Matt Meloy: Gross.
Joe Bob Perkins: Gross.
Chris Sighinolfi - Jefferies: Okay. And then Matt, I know you reviewed it, scribbling quickly, so you don’t mind in ask you to review you again just the cash tax rate expectations for two base for TRGP?
Matt Meloy: Yes, it’s come in higher than our 27% estimate for the first half of the year. It’s really been closer to about 33ish% for the first half. And that’s driven by higher TRP EBITDA which is a good thing and helps over the longer term, but in the short-term, it creates more taxable income at TRC. So, given we are revising guidance here higher again, in the second half of this year, something kind of in line with first half seems to be a reasonable estimate.
Chris Sighinolfi - Jefferies: Okay, great. And then the final thing just to rephrase Michael’s question a little bit differently, Joe, obviously I think about that new capacity sort of targeted let’s say normal operating condition run-rate up to a month? Roughly what percentage today is that would be sort of not under longer term contract would be?
Joe Bob Perkins: Well, in the first quarter we sort of gained….
Chris Sighinolfi - Jefferies: I hear Rene laughing by the way.
Joe Bob Perkins: We anticipated the question. We also know the answer we are going to provide. In the first quarter, we sort of gave numbers. We are not trying to be hard headed or resistant, but it’s not really in our interest to give specific numbers on our contracting on a quarterly basis. We may provide some additional quantification say at our next annual update. What we said today was that relative to first quarter when we said that we had an average of 4.2 million barrels contracted for the remaining three quarters and where we said 2015 had a similar amount contracted. And I think we also said that we had contracts going out to 2020. What we said this time is we are continuing to add contracts with a lot of demand. And we are continuing to add contract term with a lot of demand. So, that’s directional for you, but I know it’s not what you wanted.
Chris Sighinolfi - Jefferies: Okay.
Joe Bob Perkins: Well, thanks again. Thanks for your time.
Operator: And I am showing no further questions. I’d like to turn the call back over to Joe Bob Perkins for any closing remarks.
Joe Bob Perkins - Chief Executive Officer: Well, thank you all very much for your attendance and for all of your questions. I particularly want to thank you for everybody’s kind words to Roy and Rene. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact any of us. Gene, Matt, Rene, myself, and probably have more phone numbers than that. So, have a good day and have a nice weekend. Goodbye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2014 Q1  (2014-05-01 10:30:00) =====

Analysts:  Jerren Holder – Goldman Sachs Ethan Bellamy – Robert W. Baird T.J. Schultz – RBC Capital Markets  Chris Sighinolfi – Jefferies 
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Targa Resources’ First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to the conference over to Jen Kneale. You may begin.
Jennifer Kneale: Thank you, Operator. I'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2014 investor call for both Targa Resources Corp. and Targa Resources Partners LP. Before we get started, I would like to mention that Targa Resources Corp., TRC, or the Company and Targa Resources Partners LP, Targa Resources Partners or the Partnership, have published their joint earnings release which is available on our website www.targaresources.com. We will also be posting an updated Investor Presentation to the website later today.  Speaking on the call today will be Joe Bob Perkins, Chief Executive Officer, and Matt Meloy, Chief Financial Officer. Other management team members are available for the Q&A. Joe Bob and Matt are going to be comparing the first quarter 2014 results to prior period results, as well as providing additional color on our results, business performance, and other matters of interest, including our revised 2014 financial outlook that was released on March 31, 2014. I would like to remind you that any statements made during this call that might include the Company's or the Partnership's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Please note that actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings, including the Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. With that, I will turn it over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Jen. Welcome and thanks to everyone for participating. For today’s call, I’ll start off with a high level review of our record setting first quarter 2014 performance highlights, including discussing some of the factors that resulted in our reported quarterly results being higher than our preliminary results announced on March 31. We will then turn it over to Matt to review the Partnership’s consolidated financial results, its segment results and other financial matters for the partnership. Matt will also review key financial matters related to Targa Resources Corp. Following Matt’s comments, I’ll provide some concluding remarks and we’ll include some additional color around our 2014 financial outlook and our outlook for growth capital projects and expenditures, then we’ll take your questions. Our reported first quarter adjusted EBITDA was a record $232 million as compared to $132 million for the first quarter of last year, up $100 million rounded to the nearest million. This 75% increase was driven by record quarterly operating margin in the Logistics & Marketing division and record quarterly operating margin in the Field G&P segment. the Logistics & Marketing operating margin was 79% higher than the first quarter of 2013. Likewise, Field G&P operating margin was 75% higher in the first quarter 2014 versus the first quarter 2013. Our reported first quarter adjusted EBITDA was also higher than our preliminary release by more than our normal conservatism. Therefore a few comments on the increase. We typically have a number of pluses and minuses when numbers are reported for a quarter versus our preliminary estimates. However, for Q1 the adjustments were almost all positive as we benefited from business driven upward adjustments across most of our business units.  The following business units all had meaningful increases, averaging more than a $1 million per business unit, North Texas, SAOU, Badlands and Sand Hills, each within the Field G&P segment. LOU, Southwest Louisiana and VESCO, each within the coastal G&P segment, LAA and CBF, each in the logistics asset segment and NGL marketing, post-sale marketing and commercial transportation, each within the marketing and distribution segment. So the upward adjustment to final realized quarterly numbers is due to positive business drivers or multiple business units and maybe a bit of conservatism.  Let’s move to more performance highlights and discuss year-over-year results for the first quarter, starting with the Field Gathering and Processing segment, which produced operating margin of $94 million, which as previously mentioned was a record quarter representing that impressive increase at 75% versus the first quarter of 2013. We’re very pleased with our first quarter results, particularly given the impact of the severe cold weather that occurred throughout the quarter. Our margin increase was driven by the combination of a number of factors, including significantly higher year-over-year contribution from Badlands, higher commodity prices and an increased throughput volume across all our systems except for Versado. For some Saunders area, connections had just now returned to pre power levels. With the activity for the south part of Versado at highs versus recent years, we continue to expect that Versado volumes, like all other Field G&P volumes, to be higher or significantly higher in 2014 than in 2013.  The logistics assets segment produced quarterly operating margins of $97 million, up 72% compared to last year, primarily driven by higher LPG export activity and higher fractionation activity, including some reservation payments received in both areas. Despite the temporary impact of severe cold weather on domestic propane of logistics and on periods of higher [marketability] of propane prices during the quarter, overall long term and short term demand for exports was strong.  Comparing the first quarter of 2014 versus the first quarter of 2013, we’ve obviously benefited from full quarter contributions from phase 1 of our international export expansion and from our 100,000 barrel per day train 4, both of which came online in the second half of 2013. These two projects are also somewhat related in that capability of train 4 to make low ethane propane helps support the export effort.  Operating margins for our marketing and distribution segment were 90% higher in the first quarter of 2014 than the same time period last year, primarily as a result of the increase of LPG export activity and also due to higher NGL marketing margins and higher wholesale propane margins from increased logistics driven opportunities and a favorable market environment in the first quarter. Distributable cash flow for the quarter of $189 million resulted in distribution coverage of approximately 1.6 times, based on our first quarter declared distribution of $76.25 or $3.05 on an annual basis. Consistent with what we had said previously regarding the impact of a single quarter’s performance on our distribution and dividend policies, we want to reiterate that we use multiyear views for our dividends and distributions when we declare them or when we announce guidance relative to our expectations.  The last two quarters of performance have exceeded our expectation and we expect to use that out performance to increase our coverage while continuing to steadily grow our distributions and dividends with that same multiyear view. The partnership’s first quarter distribution represents a 9% increase compared to the first quarter of 2013. At the TRC level, the first quarter dividend of $64.75 or $2.59 annualized represents a 31% increase compared to the first quarter of 2013. So for 2014 we continue to expect partnership distribution growth of 7% to 9% and are clearly on track to be on the high side of that expectation. At the TRC level, we continue to expect dividend growth of more than 25%. That wraps up my initial comments, and I’ll hand it over to Matt. 
Matthew Meloy: Thanks Joe Bob. I’d like to add my welcome and thank you for joining our call today. As mentioned, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $232 million compared to $132 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily the result of higher LPG export activity and fractionation activity in our logistics and marketing division, a higher contribution from Badlands and higher commodity prices and volume throughput in our Field G&P segment. Overall operation margin increased58% for the first quarter compared to the first quarter last year. I will review the drivers of this performance in the segment reviews. Net maintenance capital expenditures were $12 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to $19 million in the first quarter 2013. We continue to expect $90 million of net maintenance capital expenditures for the full year of 2014.  Turning to the segment level, I’ll summarize the first quarter’s performance on a year-over-year basis and we’ll start with our Gathering and Processing segments. Field Gathering and Processing operating margin increased by 75% compared to last year, driven by increased commodity prices, higher natural gas inlet volumes and higher crude oil gathering volumes. First quarter of 2014 natural gas inlet volumes for the Field Gathering and Processing segment were 853 million cubic feet per day, a 17% increase compared to the same period in 2013. The overall increase in natural gas inlet volumes was due to increases in the following business units; 108% at Badlands, 27% in North Texas, 19% at SAOU and 9% at Sand Hills. Inlet volumes at Versado were 4% lower during the same period last year due to some producer delays in returning some affected Saunders area wells to pre-fire levels. We continue to expect growth across all our Field G&P systems in 2014.  Crude oil gathered increased to 75,000 barrels per day in the first quarter, 137% increase versus the same period last year and highlights our continued progress in North Dakota. We also continue to expect 2014 average Badlands crude gathered volumes to approximately double 2013 average volumes. For the segment, natural gas prices increased by 49%, NGL prices increased by 19% and Condensate prices increased by 4% compared to the first quarter of 2013.  Turning now to the Coastal Gathering and Processing segment, operating margin increase 11% in the first quarter compared to last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher NGL sales prices and the receipt of some short term volumes with higher average GPM at LOU, which we do not expect to replicate going forward. Gross NGL production decreased slightly as a result of the impact of severe weather and some third party operational issues. For the segment, natural gas prices increased by 45%, NGL prices increased by 12% and Condensate prices decreased by 11% compared to the first quarter of 2013.  Next I’ll provide an overview of the two downstream segments. Starting with the Logistics Assets segment, as Joe Bob mentioned in the opening, first quarter operating margin increased 72% compared to the first quarter of 2013, driven by higher LPG export and fractionation activity including the receipt of reservation fees in both areas. For the quarter, we loaded an average of 3.5 million barrels per month of LPG exports and also benefited from reservation fees for two VOGCs that were scheduled but not loaded. We continued to improve our capabilities to load vessels that go into park and are now also benefiting from a new additional 12 inch pipeline from Mont Belvieu to Galena Park being in service. The addition of the pipeline is part of the broader second phase of our international export expansion which we are completing in stages through the third quarter of 2014. The pipeline is completed, the dock and refrigeration are expected to be in-service ahead of schedule and a balance of the project should be completed as expected.  In the marketing and distribution segment, operating margin for the segment increased 90% over the first quarter of 2013, due primarily the higher LPG export activity and higher NGL marketing and wholesale margins related to a more favorable market environment. With that, let’s now move briefly to capital structure and liquidity. As of March 31, we had $355 million of outstanding borrowings under the partnerships’ $1.2 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due 2017. With outstanding letters of credit of $97 million, revolver availability was about $748 million a quarter after. Total liquidity, including approximately $81 million of cash on hand was about $829 million. At quarter end, we had borrowings of $234 million under our $300 million accounts receivable securitization facility.  In the first quarter we received net proceeds of approximately $150 million from equity issuances under our At-The-Market equity program which allows us to periodically sell equity at prevailing market prices. We continue to be very pleased with the success of our ATM program and expect to continue to use the ATM program to raise equity in 2014.  Total funded debt on March 31 was approximately $2.8 billion or about 55% of total capitalization and our first quarter combined debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.0 times.  Next, I’d like to make a few comments about our fee-based margin, hedging and capital spending programs for the year. For the first quarter of 2014, our operating margin was approximately 60% fee-based and we continue to expect operating margin to be about 60% to 65% fee-based during the year.  During the first quarter we added some additional hedges for natural gas to our non-fee-based operating margin relative to the partnership’s current estimate of our equity volumes from Field Gathering and Processing. We estimate that we currently have hedged approximately 70% of the remaining 2014 natural gas and approximately 20% of remaining 2014 combined NGL and condensate volumes.  When we updated our 2014 financial outlook on March 31, we indicated that we had not made any changes to our price tag for2014. We also provided an updated sensitivity that a $0.05 change and a weighted average price of the partnership’s typical NGL gallon would correspondingly change 2014 adjusted EBITDA by approximately 1%. Last fall, our regional guidance sensitivity was a $0.05 change in NGL price would change 2014 adjusted EBITDA by approximately 2%. The reduction in this sensitivity is driven by higher fee-based margin expected during the rest of the year and previously contemplated as well as a realization of one quarter’s financial results.  Moving on to capital spending, as announced on March 31, we now estimate approximately $700 million of growth capital expenditures in 2014. The most visible changes to our capital expenditure estimates were the addition of Badlands spending for our new 40 million a day plant that may be in service by the end of the year, inclusion of some spending in 2014 in our petroleum logistics business related to the construction of the condensate splitter and our channel view terminal, and of course the revised estimate also includes some small projects and a reevaluation of the expected timing of existing expenditures.  Next, I’ll make few brief remarks about the results of Targa Resources Corp. Targa Resources Corp standalone distributable cash flow for the first quarter of 2014 was $27 million and TRC declared approximately $27 million in dividends for the quarter. On April 15, TRC declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.6475 per common share or $2.59 per common share on an annualized basis, representing an approximately 31% increase over the annualized rate paid with respect to the first quarter of 2013. As of March 31, TRC had $72 million in borrowings outstanding under its $150 million senior security credit facility and $14 million in cash, resulting in total liquidity of approximately $92 million. We continue to expect a 27% effective cash tax rate for TRC for the full year in 2014.  That concludes my review and I’ll now turn the call back over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you, Matt. As mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, I will now provide some additional color around our revised 2014 financial outlook and an update on the status of our growth capital projects. When we first provided you with our 2014 financial outlook back in early November, we had only been operating Phase 1 of our newly completed international export expansion for less than two months, part of which was a very rapid startup and testing phase. With this limited view of our operational capabilities at Galena Park, as well as limited view of export market demand for our not yet proven facility, we provided guidance at the time that only included the contracted cargos to date. We’ve now been loading low ethane propane, servicing VLGCs and continuing to serve our HD5 and butane business for more than six months. We have clearly benefited from the high levels of export activity and higher than expected facility utilization and see continued customer interest in short term and long term contracts for our services. Since that time we have also experienced favorable activity in volumes across all our businesses.  As a result of our activity at Galena Park and other factors, we raised our financial outlook on March 31to provide an updated expected guidance range of $820 million to $880 million for 2014 adjusted EBITDA. The biggest drivers in the upward guidance revision are; the successful completion of the first quarter where results clearly exceeded our initial expectations. The inclusion of already contracted short term and long term export volumes at the contracted rates and some expected volumes beyond those that were already contracted, and increased volume expectations for the year across our Field Gathering and Processing segments as I previously mentioned. Because there is still a range of outcomes around key factors, we are providing a range that account for upsides and downsides, in particular for the range of potential export performance as well as for potential upsides and downsides relative to our volume expectations in our other businesses. We also want to remind you, that similarly to the last two years, we expect the second quarter EBITDA to be lower than the first quarter EBITDA. It may be the lowest quarter in the year for 2014 as a result of the impact of seasonality on several of our businesses and the startup of additional projects that will occur throughout the year.  Moving to the status of our major growth projects, I’m very pleased to announce that our 200 million cubic feet a day Longhorn plant in North Texas is expected to be fully operational this month. Longhorn will be online earlier than was expected when we finally broke ground and will also be under budget. At SAOU, we expect our 200 million cubic feet a day High Plains Plant to be completed by the end of the second quarter. We are also in the process of constructing the 35 miles of pipeline that will interconnect our Sand Hill system and our SAOU system and expect that pipeline to be completed along a similar timeframe to the High Plains Plant. And with activity around all of our Permian Basin remaining at high levels, we are looking at other opportunities to expand in the area.  Moving to North Dakota, we are pleased with our continued volume growth, despite a very cold winter. Our assets and our Targa employees performed very well in the first quarter. And we were able to gather 2.4 times more crude and 2.1 times more natural gas than during the same time last year. The volume growth that we are experiencing is evidence of our progress and significantly expanding our system and capabilities. Producers around our system continue to be incredibly active and there’s still a lot of opportunity for improvement. We are adding as announced another 40 million cubic feet a day natural gas processing plant at Badlands that may be in service by the end of 2014. Natural gas flaring remains a major issue in the Williston Basin and we are doing our best to serve our producer customers by increasing our capabilities.  In late December 2013, we announced that we had signed a joint venture with Kinder Morgan to provide fractionation services downstream up there in MarkWest Utica Marcellus Texas Pipeline, abbreviated UMTP. UMTP is continuing to gain traction with producers, but as mentioned in Kinder’s Q1 2014 earnings call, UMTP does not yet have commitments. Given the continued success of producers in the Permian, Eagle Ford, Mid-Continent as well as the partnerships growing equity volumes, there are other potential commercial needs for train 5 beyond UMTP, and commercial discussions are ongoing related to train 5 capacity. Obviously the timing of Train 5 is subject to the conclusion of sufficient commercial arrangements, but we do have the permit in hand and we do have the land for the construction and we expect to proceed sometime in the near future.  Similarly, the timing for Train 6 is subject to commercial demand and I believe that Train 6 is simply a question of when and not if. As mentioned earlier in the call, we’re completing the second phase of our international export expansion in stages and our operational capabilities will continue to improve as each stage is completed with phase 2 expected to be fully operational in the third quarter of 2014. We continue to benefit from significant demand for long term and short term contracts at Galena Park.  For the remainder of 2014, we have an average of 4.2 million barrels of exports per month contracted. That 4.2 million barrels of exports includes both short term and long term contracts. Looking forward to 2015, we have a similar amount already contracted under just our longer term arrangements. Some of those longer term arrangements extend as long as 2020. Obviously as we complete our expansion projects, our export capabilities for next year are even greater than this year, providing potential volume upside.  On March 31, we announced the partnership approved construction of an approximately $115 million, 35,000 barrel per day condensate splitter at our existing Channelview facility. We’ve begun the permitting process for the splitter and its associated infrastructure and expect that construction will take approximately 18 months after receipt of all our permits.  So given everything we’ve discussed today, it’s safe to say that we’re very pleased with Targa performance to date and feel very positive about the future. We continue to execute across our business units and demand is robust for our upstream and downstream services. Our assets benefit as producer activity remains high and we now see no slowdown at all around our Field Gathering and Processing areas of operations.  Our 2014 outlook of a range of $820 million to $880 million is about 30% to 40% over the adjusted EBITDA record we set in 2013. We think our performance in the first quarter, got us off to a really good start.  With that we’ll open it up to questions. I’ll turn it back to you operator. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from Jerren Holder of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jerren Holder – Goldman Sachs: Good morning. Just wanted to start off with I guess the commentary around distribution growth and understand that you guys are taking a multiyear outlook in making those decisions. But looking back over the past two years, the rate of growth has been in the double digit range. So I guess going forward with the strong coverage and expectations for the year at least, should we be thinking about the multiyear growth outlook to be in the double digit range as well?
Joe Bob Perkins: I kind of go back to that question often and I understand asking us to provide multiyear guidance. We continue to try to give it to you one year at a time and our guidance for 2014 should be viewed with our historical performance and we’re comfortable with that 7% to 9% at the MLP and the 25% plus at Targa Resources Corp.
Jerren Holder – Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Thanks for the color on the growth projects. Just wanted to touch upon some of the stuff on your backlog, seeing one of the condensate splitter announcements take place, what is the outlook from the demand perspective for incremental condensate splitters and what regions are you seeing that activity in?
Joe Bob Perkins: What we’ve said publicly about those discussions with potential customers is that we were having discussions about splitters, plural. We’ve announced one and I think I could still say we are having discussions about splitters plural. The interest in activity is high for parties such as Targa who are well positioned to execute on that.
Matt Meloy: We also have just to bring to your attention, the investor presentation we’ll be posting shortly after this call and you’ll see in our backlog where we outlined $1.5 billion of additional growth projects, not yet approved. They’re on the official CapEx forecast. You’ll see a condensate splitter – I was going to say additional condensate splitter. So we have another one still on that backlog. 
Operator: And the next question is from Ethan Bellamy of Baird. Your line is open.
Ethan Bellamy – Robert W. Baird: One of the more interesting things to occur recently is the success of Continental Hawkinson up in the Bakken and Harold Hamm says he thinks the Bakken is going to do 2 million barrels a day. Street consensus would be a lot lower than that. You guys have had Badlands for a year now. Just curious about where you think wells per section is going to shake out and is there a chance that Harold is right about 2 million barrels a day? And if so would that mean another billion dollars you guys can spend up there potentially?
Joe Bob Perkins : That was a lot of questions. I’ll share my perspective. From the time we first started looking at the Williston basin, my perspective has continued to go up. To some extent we suffer by looking backwards at type curves and well performance and what producers are doing. Harold is in a good position to be looking forward. And each time we think we understand how many wells there are going to be per section, we end up raising our internal estimate. There are better parties to be the official spokesman for what that’s going to look like. And it really does vary by subsection of the Bakken/Three Forks, but not unlike the Permian Basin. Producers continue to find more and more of it to be productive and continue to improve the technology such that each completion is better than the last one in a particular area. That’s very, very good for our Badlands position and for our potential to expand that Badlands position. 
Ethan Bellamy – Robert W. Baird: Okay. Fair enough. Another big picture question, a little closer to home. TRGP has been one of greatest value creations stories in the history of the MLP sector. The last stage for GPs tends to be bringing them in to the MLP. Is that something you guys have look at any time recently? And is that something we should consider as part of our investment framework? 
Joe Bob Perkins : We look at everything, but it’s not on our near term radar scope. There’s not a reason to do that right now. We’ve got lots of projects to pursue at MLP. We are not constrained by the burden of IDRs or costs to capital which is the argument you usually see. And whereas I wouldn’t say never, I’d certainly would say don’t expect it anytime soon. 
Ethan Bellamy - Robert W. Baird: Helpful. Thank you so much. 
Joe Bob Perkins : I haven’t gotten a question in this area so I want to correct a Perkins misspeak. It may not be the only one I made, but as I was describing our relationship with Kinder Morgan, I probably got a little off script. It’s a good thing that people listen to me instead of what was printed on a page for me. But I said joint venture it just came out. That’s not what it is. It’s a letter of intent in a relationship that we are working very closely to try to make things happen. So we should strike the joint venture from the transcript part, but I’ll continue to remain positive about their project and us working with their project. 
Operator: (Operator instructions) And the next question is from T.J. Schultz of RBC. Your line is open.
Joe Bob Perkins: I know you were just getting ready to ask me that question about ...
T.J. Schultz – RBC Capital Markets : Exactly. I’ll stay far away from that. But the $1.5 billion projects under development I guess with that list with the slides but maybe you could quickly add what else has may been added or taken off that committed list or what’s now still under development? Is it just the additional splitter possibly? 
Joe Bob Perkins: Yeah. Really the only change is the additional splitter. Most of the things we talked are Badlands additional expansion, Permian additional expansion, train 5, train 6. So those things are still in continued development.
T.J. Schultz - RBC Capital Markets : Okay and then how do we think about timing there for some of those projects to move into the committed bucket and when would you expect some of the timing for those projects to be put in place? And if you could talk a little bit about the expected returns that you’re looking at on that CapEx?
Joe Bob Perkins: We’ve had, I guess it’s almost a tradition of showing you the ones that have been approved on one page and then showing the ones that are publicly known we’re working about on another page and then we have a tradition of not showing you the ones that aren’t publicly known we’re working on. So if you think of those three pages, we’ve got a pretty good track record of projects rolling from one page to the other, including the ones that have been approved getting done on time and on budget. We’ve given some examples of what we think the timing are. It’ll take that long for the first condensate splitter project to be approved. I’d like to think that we would get another one approved sometime in the future. I use the term the near future for Train 5 because I believe that and people have been looking at for a while and know that we have the permit in hand and know we have the land, know that we have internal needs for it.  I really think that’s all we’ve said publicly about what moves from the second page to the first page and I’m not getting ready to say anything about what’s moving from the third page to the second page. Our Permian activity, just recently I think additional activity on the Permian was sometimes defined as pipes and plants. We announced the 35 mile plant and it’s already in progress and under construction. We continue to look at other opportunities there. We’ve remained very active. Additional Permian work could be in the future. It may not fall the super near future, but certainly in the future. Is that helpful?
T.J. Schultz – RBC Capital Markets : Good, thanks. That’s all I got. Appreciate it.
Joe Bob Perkins: You asked for returns also, I’m sorry. We’ve characterized the returns on both of those sheets as pretty attractive. Most of them leverage our existing assets and that’s good. The range of the first page, which is the approved ones that we’ve said officially is
Matthew Meloy: Five to seven times Bob is our principle.
Joe Bob Perkins: And some of those on that list have been better than that range, as you know. I don’t expect that the second page, the not yet approved projects under development look very much different at all. In the third page, it looks like the second page.
Operator: And the next question is from Chris with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Chris Sighinolfi – Jefferies: Thanks for all the added colors this morning and in particular, the insight into Galena and the operations sort of the educational learning progress as you’ve had that facility online. I’m wondering if I could just explore a little bit more in terms of the delta from 4Q to 1Q. And then sort of from a spot cargo activity perspective, any additional color you could provide into that. Apologize if you’ve said it and I’ve missed it. And then in addition to, as you refine the operations of that asset, maybe the thoughts around contracting more volumes on a firm basis and if you give an update as to sort of how much is open versus contracted at this point in time.
Joe Bob Perkins: Let’s understand all of the questions, Chris. Let me try to summarize with what we carefully chose to do from a competitive standpoint. For the remainder of 2014, we have an average of 4.2 million barrels of exports contracted. And you know we’re increasing our capacity along that time too, but I’m not drawing the capacity increase curve. We have said that once phase 2 is done that we’ll officially be 5.5 million barrels to 6 million barrels per month of capacity. Now, we also then carefully said that for 2014, relative to that 4.2 million barrels a month remaining average, we’ve already contracted for a similar amount in 2015. So it’s clear that we’ve got an increasing amount of term for early 2014 to now 2014, 2014 to 2015, we’ve got more term. I don’t want to provide more color for competitive reasons on that exact mix for the remainder of the year. I sort of did provide what the mix looks like right now and 2015 because looking out into 2015 we probably haven’t booked spots that far in advance. And beyond that color, I’m just not comfortable with it right now.
Chris Sighinolfi – Jefferies: Okay. No, I appreciate the competitive dynamic and your added color. I guess we were just thinking about as a number – we talked about this at your Analyst Day, but obviously you and Enterprise have done quite well in the export dynamic to date. Seems to me like a lot of midstream players would now like to get involved and we have a slate of projects on the drawing board. And so, just in that sense, trying to get a feeling for the appetite internally given the asset performance to contract over time more and more of that capacity. So that was just where I was coming from. I do appreciate your comments on this and everything else this morning. Thanks.
Operator: (Operator instructions).
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you all very much. If you have any follow up questions, feel free to give Jen or Matt or myself, any of us a call. Good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this conclude today’s program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Targa Resources’ Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Jen Kneale, Director of Finance. Please go ahead.
Jen Kneale: Thank you, operator. I'd like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and full year 2013 investor call for both Targa Resources Corp. and Targa Resources Partners LP. Before we get started, I would like to mention that Targa Resources Corp., TRC, or the Company and Targa Resources Partners LP, Targa Resources Partners or the Partnership, have published their joint earnings release which is available on our website www.taragaresources.com. We will also be posting an updated Investor Presentation to the website after the call. Speaking on the call today would be Joe Bob Perkins, Chief Executive Officer, and Matt Meloy, Chief Financial Officer. Joe Bob and Matt are going to be comparing the fourth quarter and full year 2013 results to prior period results, as well as providing additional color on our results, business performance, and other matters of interest. I would like to remind you that any statements made during this call that might include the Company's or the Partnership's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Please note that actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings, including the Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. With that, I will turn it over to Joe Bob Perkins.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Jen. Welcome and thank you to everyone for participating. Besides Matt, Jen and myself, our several other members of the management team will be available to assist in the Q&A session. For today’s call I’ll start off with high level review of performance and highlights. We’ll then turn it over to Matt to review the Partnership’s consolidated financial results and segment results and other financial matters. Matt will also review key financial matters related to Targa Resources Corp. And following Matt’s comments I’ll provide some concluding remarks and then we’ll take your questions. We’re pleased to announce that 2013 was a record year for Targa on multiple fronts; record adjusted EBITDA of $629 million; record Logistics & Marketing division operating margin of $424 million, driven by key organic growth projects that came online during the year; record Field Gathering & Processing volumes; record distributable cash flow of $440 million; and of course increased distributions for TRP and increased dividends for TRC. We placed over $1 billion of projects in service in 2013, largely supported by fee-based contracts. This impactful level of strategic CapEx was combined with a unique strategic acquisition of the Badlands properties, which we closed at the end of 2012. Yes, 2013 was the transformative year we predicted. The underlying fundamentals of our business are very strong and 2013 EBITDA was on the strong side of our guidance. We’re pleased that we ended 2013 with a very strong fourth quarter driven by; first, higher than expected contributions from key organic growth projects that came online in the second half of the year, particularly fractionation and export projects at Mont Belvieu and Galena Park. Demand for propane and butane exports was very robust in Q4. In the first phase of our export expansion project came online in September for Q4 operations. Our new facilities performed very well, exceeding our expectations; second, full year contribution and increasing quarter-over-quarter contribution from our Badlands operations in North Dakota; third, increasing Field Gathering & Processing volume growth year-over-year as producers kept the pedal to the floor, continuing to develop acreage across our basins of operations; and fourth, higher NGL and natural gas prices in Q4 that helped offset the operations impacts of very cold weather in the quarter and helped offset some of the lower prices realized during the first part of the year. And with those positive drivers, our record year was accomplished despite the impacts of the fire at our Saunders plant that reduced Versado volumes and an incident to the third-party NGL pipeline from our VESCO facility that impacted VESCO performance earlier in the year. The additional export and fractionation capabilities drove another year of record operating margin for our Logistics & Marketing division, up 39% compared to 2012. This was driven by, daily LPG export volumes that more than doubled as a result of the September completion of phase one of our expansion, coupled with increased export volumes through improved operational efficiency at Galena Park and Mont Belvieu in the first three quarters of the year. We also saw continued strong producer activity across all areas of our Field Gathering & Processing segment. Volumes were up in North Texas, Sand Hills and SAOU and they would have been up at Versado except for that temporary negative impact of the Saunders fire. We also benefited from contributions from the Badlands assets in 2013. With increases each quarter, we raised the Partnership’s full year 2013 distribution 11% over 2012, consistent with our original 2013 full year distribution guidance of 10% to 12% that we gave you in the fall of 2012. At the TRC level, our full year 2013 dividend was 35% higher over 2012, above our original 30% plus dividend growth guidance given for the year. We continue to expect to deliver full year 2014 distribution growth of 8% to 10% at the Partnership and expect to exceed 25% TRC dividend growth for 2014. Later in the call I’ll discuss our expectations for 2014. Our 2013 distribution coverage tracked just as we said it would, finishing slightly over 1.0 times for the year and our 1.4 times coverage for the fourth quarter reflects the strong performance of our businesses with several expansion projects online. I would also like to discuss our thoughts on some of the domestic propane market issues you may have been reading about, particularly the impact in the Midwest. While Targa doesn’t have assets in the Midwest and do not even have a Midwest region, we have responded to the market with our transportation assets and terminals outside the region helping to serve the market needs. For example, we’re actively moving product or helping others move product to areas in need and our facilities and equipment are running essentially full out to help with the temporary logistics constraints. But even with available propane and storage we have reached physical limitations of our transportation assets, mainly trucks, railcars, barges and rack capacity and just how much propane we can move. The factors impacting the tightness in local propane markets have been widely published and discussed. For example inventory levels going into the winter for the Midwest were the lowest in 10 years, made worst by a late and extensive crop drying season. By contrast Gulf Coast inventories were slightly above the 10 year average as we entered winter and then the coldest winter in over 20 years hit the Midwest in successive ways. Plus, the region experienced some key supply disruptions from two Midwest refinery shutdowns, major pipeline outage, lowering the typical region supply which normally supports market. In that context, we support the emergency transportation measures such as extending working hours for truckers taken by states to accommodate the regional issues and we’re continuing to do what we can to help meet the market demand. I’d like to conclude our introductory remarks with a great big pat on the back to our entire team for Targa’s performance in 2013, and Targa’s very strong positioning for the future. I think the following data-points are pretty impressive; 2012 adjusted EBITDA of $515 million; 2013 adjusted EBITDA of $629 million; and 2014 EBITDA guidance of $750 million or higher, and that is combined with additional growth projects in process that will contribute in the future. We really could end the call on that note, but I’ll turn it over to Matt in return perhaps repeating myself in a few minutes. Matt?
Matt Meloy: Thanks Joe Bob. I’d like to add my welcome and thank you for joining our call today. Joe Bob discussed some full year 2013 records and highlights, so let’s now turn our attention to Q4 results. Adjusted EBTIDA for the quarter was a record 215 million, compared to 131 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by a 73% increase in operating margin from our Logistics & Marketing division resulting from a full quarter of contributions from our export expansion and CBF Train 4. Our Gathering & Processing division margin increased by 40% driven by contribution from Badlands and higher inlet volumes across all our field G&P systems, except Versado which was negatively impacted for two months due to the fire at the Saunders plant, Saunders is now running again and Versado would have also had higher volumes if it were not for the temporary interruption. Overall operating margin increased 49% for the fourth quarter, compared to last year and I will review the drivers of this performance in our segment review. As we have mentioned before please note, that we benefit from the receipt of certain minimum contract payments at year that we do not otherwise see in the first three quarters of the year. In Q4 approximately 15 million of our operating margin was from the receipt of take-or-pay, reservation fee deficiency or other such contract payments. Net maintenance capital expenditures were 18 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to 18 million in 2012. Turning to the segment level, I’ll summarize the fourth quarter’s performance on a year-over-year basis starting with our Gathering & Processing business. Our Field Gathering & Processing operating margin increased by approximately 56% compared to last year driven by contribution from Badlands, increasing volumes and higher commodity prices. These effects were partially offset by the impact of an early and cold winter, third-party operational issues and the fire at the Saunders plant in Versado. Fourth quarter 2013 natural gas plant inlet for the Field Gathering & Processing segment was 785 million cubic feet per day, a 9% increase compared to the same period in 2012. All of the Field G&P business units other than Versado had higher natural gas inlet for the quarter. Natural gas inlet volumes increased by approximately 16% of those North Texas and SAOU and 4% at Sand Hills. For the segment, we also benefited from higher commodity prices in the quarter. Condensate prices were 12% higher, natural gas prices were 7% higher and NGL prices were 7% higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Fourth quarter results for the Field segment also benefited from volumes in our Badlands system where natural gas inlet and crude oil volumes were up significantly in Q4 and where operation’s effectiveness is improving. We previously indicated that we expected our Badlands crude oil gather volumes to be at least 20% higher in Q4 over Q3 and actual volumes ended up being 24% higher, illustrative of the progress that we continue to make in extending our system footprint even with the onset of winter. In the Coastal Gathering & Processing segment, operating margin increased 6% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Although we saw a reduction in total natural gas inlet volumes in the Coastal segment NGL production increased by 5% and operating margin increased by 6% as a result of the volumes moving to more efficient and better located plants in the target system. Turning now to our Logistics Assets segment, fourth quarter operating margin increased 110% compared to the fourth quarter 2012 due primarily to higher export and fractionation volumes partially offset by increased operating expenses associated with additional assets in service and higher system maintenance cost. Export activity at our Galena Park marine terminal on the Houston Ship Channel increased again this quarter with the first phase of our international export expansion project complete and running. We benefited from robust international demand for both propane and butane during the quarter and loaded an average of 124,000 barrels a day or 3.8 million barrels per month. In the Marketing and Distribution segment, operating margin for the segment increased 25% over the fourth quarter of 2012 due primarily to increased LPG export activity. With that, let’s now move briefly to capital structure and liquidity. At December 31st, we had 395 million of outstanding borrowings, under the Partnership’s 1.2 billion senior secured revolving credit facility, due 2017. With outstanding letters of credit at 87 million revolver availability was about 718 million at year-end. Total liquidity including approximately 57 million of cash on-hand was approximately 775 million. At December 31st, we had borrowings of 280 million under our accounts receivable securitization facility. Early in December, we entered into an amendment to increase our facility to 300 million and extend the termination date to December 2014. On a debt compliance basis, which provides us adjusted EBITDA credit for material growth projects that are in process but not yet complete and makes other adjustments, our total leverage ratio at the end of 2013 was 3.6 times, near the middle of our stated range of 3 to 4 times on a compliance basis. In the fourth quarter, we received gross proceeds of approximately 142 million from equity issuances under our, At-The-Market equity program which allows us to periodically sell equity at prevailing market prices. In 2013 we were very pleased to raise approximately 525 million of gross proceeds under this program. Subject to market conditions, we believe that we could potentially use the ATM program to meet your equity needs in 2014, while always reserving the ability to utilize other equity operating forms if appropriate. So far this year in the ATM, we have raised gross proceeds of 57 million and we expect to be back in the market in the near future. Next, I’d like to make a few comments about our hedging and capital spending programs for the year. The contributions from fee-based capital projects placed in service in 2013; our fee-based operating margin was over 50% in every quarter increasing to approximately 62% in Q4, and 57% for full year 2013. We expect operating margin to be approximately 60% to 65% fee-based during 2014. For the non-fee-based operating margin relative to the Partnerships’ current equity volumes from Field G&P, we estimate that we have hedged approximately 70% of 2014 natural gas and approximately 20% of 2014 combined NGL and condensate. We’re less hedged than in previous years, but our diversity and fee-based improvements reduce the need to hedge commodity prices to previous percentages across all commodities. As you probably know the recent run-up in propane and ethane prices is primarily in the spot market, and in the prior month with significant backwardation in the forward market, perhaps driven by forward market liquidity most energy commodity pricing is faced with significant backwardation, and we do not feel the need to hedge additional NGL volumes at this time, but we will continue to evaluate the appropriate timing for additional NGL hedges overtime, as well as natural gas and oil hedges. Moving to capital spending, we now estimate approximately 650 million of growth capital expenditures in 2014 with approximately $1 billion of growth CapEx placed in service. We continue to expect maintenance CapEx net or interest to be approximately 90 million. Next, I’ll make few brief remarks about the results of Targa Resources Corp. On January 14th, TRC declared a fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.6075 cents per common share or $2.43 per common share on an annualized basis, representing an approximately 35% increase for the full year 2013 versus the full year 2012. TRC’s standalone distributable cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2013 was 27 million and it declared 26 million in dividends for the quarter. At year-end TRC has 84 million in borrowings outstanding under its 150 million senior secured credit facilities and 9 million in cash resulting in total liquidity of 75 million. That concludes my review. So I’ll now turn the call back over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks Matt. We know that year-end call always seems a little long and we thank you for your attention. To wrap-up the final portion of our prepared remarks, I’d like to briefly review some thoughts on 2014. At this time last year, we said that 2013 would be a transformative year for Targa, given the $950 million that we spent on growth CapEx helping drive a record on a number of fronts and further increasing our scale and diversity, combined with integrating Badlands, I’d say 2013 was truly transformative. After declaring transformative success for 2013, I wonder if we can say that 2014 will be transformative also. I think we asserted that during our November Investor & Analyst Meeting and we all still believe that is true today. We will continue to deploy significant capital in 2014 in organic growth opportunities across our business. Continued producer activity is driving opportunities across our Gathering & Processing and Downstream businesses and we’re not expecting slowdown in 2014. Although it has only been a couple of months since we forecasted $590 million in major project CapEx for our Investor Day. We have updated that list and have approved a couple of projects that were on the development radar screen. The 2014 estimated total for the major project list is now 650 million after we made additions in cost and timing estimate updates. Our Board recently approved the construction of a new pipeline in the Permian Basin in associate, compression, dehy and treating facilities. That new pipeline will connect our SAOU and Sand Hill systems. It’s about 35 miles of pipe, about $30 million of investment, including the facilities and it is a strategic investment providing us with some key synergies. And will allow us to move volumes across the two systems, and serve producers between the systems. In the near-term it provides a very quick augmentation of processing capacity that was filling up at Sand Hills, creates an almost immediate ability to serve the high activity and growing producer volumes in the Sand Hills area by sending volumes to High Plains. It also helps more quickly fill the more efficient 200 million a day High Plains Plant, which is currently under construction and expected to be in service in mid-2014. It provides flexibility in additional insurance for targeting our customers. And the pipeline allows us time to contemplate the optimum location or an additional plant capacity across the two interconnected systems which have multiple plants and multiple NGL and residue takeaways. Some of us have wanted to do this for a long time. Our Board also approved an additional plant in the North Dakota, doubling the current processing capacity in support of robust producer activity in the Bakken/Three Fork plays. We’re still working on the details and timing for that new plant. But I am happy to say it was approved. I mentioned in the expected mid-2014 completion of our High Plains Plant, and I want to update you on some of the other projects that you know are currently underway. After significant delay due to greenhouse gas permitting issues, our 200 million a day Longhorn plant in North Texas is expected to be in service in the second quarter. Producers continue to be active in the Barnett combo where we have been using a third-party to process has that is in excess of our current capacity. So we’re glad that Longhorn will soon be in service. When Longhorn is operational it will be more efficient and more flexible on ethane rejection than our other plants. This plant and its residue and NGL outlets will also increase North Texas system flexibility, while creating reserve processing capacity to meet continued growth and production overtime. Moving to Galena Park and Mont Belvieu, the second phase of our international export expansion is underway. As we have mentioned previously, the expansion will be completed in stages during 2014 and will be fully operational by the third quarter of 2014. We’ve already completed the new 12 inch pipeline and it is in service at this time. In North Dakota, we’re able to make a lot of progress at Badlands in 2013, although it started slower than anticipated we made significant progress during the year and are continuing to expand our system and capabilities to support producer customers. In 2014 we will continue to build out the system with an estimated additional $190 million of CapEx spending. For 2013, we exceeded the volume expectations that we provided you for Q3 and provided you for Q4 and we expect to double our average 2014 volumes over 2013. Our primary frustration as we’ve said before with Badlands is the pace of progress on the right-of-way of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. We will continue to work with the tribe, the BIA and others to improve the situation. We don’t have the same kind of right-of-way issues on the portion of our system that is not located on the Reservation. I should also mention the current status of Train 5, we received that permit in late December and the timing of construction will be dependent on market demand. In December, we announced that we had entered into an LOI with Kinder Morgan to form a joint venture for new fractionation facilities to help support the needs of potential customers on the Kinder MarkWest Utica Marcellus Texas Pipeline that’s a mouthful, and we’ll abbreviate it UMTP. We’re currently working with Kinder Morgan and jointly discussing our services with producers and the result of UMTP’s open season will help determine that timing. Similarly, the design for and timing of Train 6 will be determined by growing market demand whether from the Utica Marcellus or elsewhere the Permian, the Eagle Ford, we expect this demand to continue as long as E&P companies are active and continuing to seek access to the market hub. So, as we have discussed the fourth quarter was the strongest quarter ever for Targa, and it is obvious that Q4 2013 exceeded our expectations, primarily as the result of some factors that might not affect 2014. You certainly would not want to extrapolate take-or-pay reservation deficiency payments received in the fourth quarter into each of the subsequent quarters. Also as we’ve discussed before, our 2014 guidance does not include activity at our export terminal beyond what we had contracted or had expected to contract at long-term market rates. In Q4 we benefited from high international demand for propane and butane, both long-term and short-term or so called spot. Early in Q1 we continue to benefit from high international demand for exports, both spot and our long-term contracts. More recently we have seen some of that short-term spot demand diminish as prices in U.S. rose relative to other global markets. It’s difficult to forecast what will happen to spot demand exports for the rest of 2014 and such spot export demand and spot rates are not included in our guidance as we’ve said before. On other business fronts, despite weather impacts, particularly in Q4 we’re pleasantly surprised by volume performance across the board. The volume improvements overtime are already included in our guidance. Those who were at our Analyst Day know that we used a $0.90 per gallon weighted average NGL price in our 2014 guidance. Obviously we’ve seen prices significantly higher thus far in Q1, but again it’s difficult to predict what will happen with prices for the rest of the year. For example, our weighted average NGL prices for January range from $0.93 a gallon up to a $1.14 a gallon, and that same average barrel is currently at a $1.1 a gallon. So given some of the factors I just discussed, you probably can tell that we feel comfortable indicating at this point that we expect 2014 EBITDA to be 750 million or better. I warned you earlier in the call I would have to repeat myself at the end. I really think that the following EBITDA data-points are pretty impressive and should be kept in mind. 2012 adjusted EBITDA of $515 million, followed by 2013 adjusted EBITDA of $629 million, followed by a 2014 EBITDA guidance of $750 million or better and additional growth projects in process that will contribute to the future. As I mentioned earlier in the call, we continue to expect to deliver full year 2014 distribution growth of 8% to 10% at the Partnership and expect to exceed 25% TRC dividend growth for 2014. So with that, we’ll open it up to questions. I’ll turn it back over to you operator.
Question:
and:
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Darren Horowitz from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Darren Horowitz : Good morning guys. Joe Bob thanks for all the color around spot shipments regarding propane and butane. I just have one quick question there and this is with regard to the Galena Park terminal. I know that you guys can do somewhere between 5.5 million and 6 million barrels a month. Can you just remind us what the spot volume was and more importantly looking forward I know that you were thinking about engineering to do a Dock 5 so does the thought process changed there with regard to the contracted mix or if you move forward with the Dock 5 expansion would it be similar to the first two expansions where it was just about all take-or-pay long-term contracts?
 Raymond James: Good morning guys. Joe Bob thanks for all the color around spot shipments regarding propane and butane. I just have one quick question there and this is with regard to the Galena Park terminal. I know that you guys can do somewhere between 5.5 million and 6 million barrels a month. Can you just remind us what the spot volume was and more importantly looking forward I know that you were thinking about engineering to do a Dock 5 so does the thought process changed there with regard to the contracted mix or if you move forward with the Dock 5 expansion would it be similar to the first two expansions where it was just about all take-or-pay long-term contracts?
Joe Bob Perkins: That was a little longer than one quick question, but thank you Darren. I did provide some color on what was going on with exports. You are correct. Our published nameplate capacity is 5.5 million to 6 million barrels after the second phase of our expansion. The additional Dock work that you mentioned is underway and there is nothing different about our expectations of the need for that additional Dock work. I think I answered the question. Didn’t I?
Darren Horowitz : Yes. No I appreciate that and Matt, just a quick question back to your guidance and the basis for the 2014 guidance. Can you just give us a little bit more color around the hedge percentages for NGL and condensate production that’s built in? And also if you could just outline the processing contract mix between what you guys have allocated for fee TOL or POP I’m just trying to get a sense for the variability for those West Texas assets?
 Raymond James: Yes. No I appreciate that and Matt, just a quick question back to your guidance and the basis for the 2014 guidance. Can you just give us a little bit more color around the hedge percentages for NGL and condensate production that’s built in? And also if you could just outline the processing contract mix between what you guys have allocated for fee TOL or POP I’m just trying to get a sense for the variability for those West Texas assets?
Matt Meloy: Yes. Sure. We had, I think we said about 20% of our NGLs and condensate is hedged into ’14 and that’s included in our guidance. The contract mix we have really hasn’t changed a whole lot overtime for the Field out in the Permian or Texas primarily percentage of proceeds that’s commodity sensitive and that’s the volume that we do hedge. We did provide a sensitivity in our guidance that had a $0.05 NGL move but equate to about a 2% EBITDA and I think we’re still comfortable with that sensitivity.
Darren Horowitz : Okay. And then Joe Bob last question, just curious about the development or the evolution of all those Badlands assets. Obviously when you look at the ramping gas inlet volumes and crude oil gathering volumes and what you’ve laid out for 2014 guidance, it would argue that you would probably have to spend more than $180 million in CapEx to keep up with the production. So I’m just curious how much incremental gathering capacity do you think that you’ll need going into 2015 and more importantly it would seem like adding incremental 20 million cubic feet a day processing plants is probably not going to be enough. So if you could just give us your thoughts on how ’15 in terms of CapEx and development could shape up that would be helpful? Thank you.

So if you could just give us your thoughts on how ’15 in terms of CapEx and development could shape up that would be helpful? Thank you.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay. First to kind of correct so everybody understands, we’ve got about 38 million a day of processing capacity right now in the Badlands, but that’s a bit of a miss number because you beat NGLs not Mcfs and this is very high liquid content gas. But in any event that 38 million a day rating for our current capacity with some work in the additional plant will go up to about 80 million a day, so we’re doubling the plant capacity hopefully here in the recently short-term. And $180 million of CapEx really is our best estimate for 2014 to try to meet the producer demand and most of that is focused on just handling our dedicated acreage as we build out the footprint and the plant for that footprint.
Darren Horowitz : Thank you.
 Raymond James: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brad Olsen from Tudor, Pickering. Please go ahead.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning Brad.
Brad Olsen : Hello everyone. Hey guys quick couple of questions. Obviously quarter was very strong versus the 750 and up guidance range you’ve provided and you also provided some helpful adjustments like the 15 million of contract true-ups. Would it be fair qualitatively to say that when thinking about kind of $750 million annual run rate and the difference between that and the 250 million less the 15 million of true-ups that the remaining margin uplift that you realized in Q4 was largely due to Dock activity above and beyond what was contracted?
 Tudor, Pickering, Holt: Hello everyone. Hey guys quick couple of questions. Obviously quarter was very strong versus the 750 and up guidance range you’ve provided and you also provided some helpful adjustments like the 15 million of contract true-ups. Would it be fair qualitatively to say that when thinking about kind of $750 million annual run rate and the difference between that and the 250 million less the 15 million of true-ups that the remaining margin uplift that you realized in Q4 was largely due to Dock activity above and beyond what was contracted?
Joe Bob Perkins: Brad I did enumerate, I will kind of repeat that we had high international demand for spot, I’ve said that first so it was the largest factor and we’ve benefited from that. That secondly, we had volume increases that exceeded expectations despite a very cold winter. And I said thirdly, that prices were up considerably from the $0.09 a gallon. And without giving you the exact numbers that’s pretty much in rank order.
Brad Olsen : Okay. And so the actual fee-based volumes on the Dock were the biggest factor in, I guess I can just imply from all that that those were significantly above what the actual contracted volumes on the Dock were expected to be?
 Tudor, Pickering, Holt: Okay. And so the actual fee-based volumes on the Dock were the biggest factor in, I guess I can just imply from all that that those were significantly above what the actual contracted volumes on the Dock were expected to be?
Joe Bob Perkins: All we had in our guidance was what the contracted volumes were expected to be.
Brad Olsen : Okay, great. And another question on kind of a condition of the export market as you see it. Obviously most expansions including yours on the Dock side have been focused on refrigerated international grade propane. Is there anything that you’re seeing as a result of inventories getting drawn down here domestically on the propane side that shifted market interest towards more expansions focused on the butane market?
 Tudor, Pickering, Holt: Okay, great. And another question on kind of a condition of the export market as you see it. Obviously most expansions including yours on the Dock side have been focused on refrigerated international grade propane. Is there anything that you’re seeing as a result of inventories getting drawn down here domestically on the propane side that shifted market interest towards more expansions focused on the butane market?
Joe Bob Perkins: Well, I won’t try to speak to other person’s expansions, but our original capability at both propane and butanes semi wrap. And if you went back overtime that was probably up to even a third butane. As we expanded our export project it gave us the capability to handle more butane as well and most of our term contracts give customers the right for butanes. You add refrigeration you can refrigerate butane at pumping capability and pipes and dock capability the butane can go with and sometimes it goes on the same ships.
Brad Olsen : Okay, great. So the latest international expansion, I guess it’s appropriate to think of that as being butane capable as well as refrigerated propane capable?
 Tudor, Pickering, Holt: Okay, great. So the latest international expansion, I guess it’s appropriate to think of that as being butane capable as well as refrigerated propane capable?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes. And we’ve got separate systems and yes you have to think of it that way, that’s the right way to think about it Brad.
Brad Olsen : Okay, great. And one more question, I know I probably asked this one on every quarterly call. But are you seeing anything in the condensate market, where you operate that would either encourage you or discourage you incrementally as you think about potentially setting up some kind of splitter or export facility on the Gulf Coast for heavier NGLs and least condensates?
 Tudor, Pickering, Holt: Okay, great. And one more question, I know I probably asked this one on every quarterly call. But are you seeing anything in the condensate market, where you operate that would either encourage you or discourage you incrementally as you think about potentially setting up some kind of splitter or export facility on the Gulf Coast for heavier NGLs and least condensates?
Joe Bob Perkins: We’re still involved in discussions I think that that demand remains high and we’ve got some facilities that are pretty well positioned for the right project.
Brad Olsen : Alright, great. Thanks a lot guys.
 Tudor, Pickering, Holt: Alright, great. Thanks a lot guys.
Matt Meloy: Yes. Thanks Brad.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from T.J. Schultz from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Joe Bob Perkins:  Good morning T.J. 
T.J. Schultz : Good morning. Good color, just if some of the spot exports continue or just in general as you look at ’14 to see some of these results trend above your expectations on EBITDA, how do you look at balancing kind of growth versus coverage longer-term? Would your preference be to build additional coverage this year, or is there an upside to that kind of targeted distribution growth range, if some of these trends continue?
 RBC Capital Markets: Good morning. Good color, just if some of the spot exports continue or just in general as you look at ’14 to see some of these results trend above your expectations on EBITDA, how do you look at balancing kind of growth versus coverage longer-term? Would your preference be to build additional coverage this year, or is there an upside to that kind of targeted distribution growth range, if some of these trends continue?
Joe Bob Perkins: I understand the question. But you kind of started with an if, it was high just because of some unexpected spot cargoes, then I'm going to build coverage with it. And that was how you started the if. I feel very comfortable with our distribution and dividend guidance, and our dividend guidance had a level or exceed that level.
T.J. Schultz : Okay, great. Everything else I had has been asked. Thanks.
 RBC Capital Markets: Okay, great. Everything else I had has been asked. Thanks.
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ethan Bellamy from Baird. Please go ahead.
Ethan Bellamy : Good morning guys. What could, or better in EBITDA guidance look like assuming everything runs smoothly and conversely if we had a $75 crude price this year, what would be the biggest kind of threat to guidance, would it be volumes or the CapEx budget, I just want to understand better the kind of a upside and the downside scenarios?
 Robert W. Baird: Good morning guys. What could, or better in EBITDA guidance look like assuming everything runs smoothly and conversely if we had a $75 crude price this year, what would be the biggest kind of threat to guidance, would it be volumes or the CapEx budget, I just want to understand better the kind of a upside and the downside scenarios?
Joe Bob Perkins: That's two separate questions, on the first question the or better, depending on the causes, I don’t know another way to explain my or better, I think I underlines it in my notes, if I didn’t emphasize it I meant to. And I don’t think it’s going to be worse. Then you said what happens with $75 crude price. Is that a differential caused to WTI? Is that a world recession? And what are the expectations of producers for what the price is going to be in the future will determine their activity. As long as producers remain active I don’t see downside to our activity, or the guidance.
Ethan Bellamy : The Panama Canal expansion looks like it might be hitting some trouble with the contractors there. Do you think that that caps the LPG export opportunity or would the volumes just go elsewhere?
 Robert W. Baird: The Panama Canal expansion looks like it might be hitting some trouble with the contractors there. Do you think that that caps the LPG export opportunity or would the volumes just go elsewhere?
Joe Bob Perkins: We don’t think it caps it. And I am not sure I’m not the Panama Canal expert. We know some people believe that the Panama Canal will sort of arb the difference in transportation and that it won’t matter, it will be a little bit, transportation will be a little bit shorter but they'll pay the difference at the Panama Canal. So none of our contracts are dependent on the Panama Canal getting finished, some of our contractors go beyond that dimensions, I'm sure it's impacting how the users of those contracts think about their shipping. But I don’t see it as a major difference. I see it as a potential upside to exports longer term once people figure out how to use it.
Ethan Bellamy : Okay. With respect to the propane deficit and price spike recently, do you see that as transitory or are there any lasting changes or impacts or opportunities for you from recent pricing?
 Robert W. Baird: Okay. With respect to the propane deficit and price spike recently, do you see that as transitory or are there any lasting changes or impacts or opportunities for you from recent pricing?
Joe Bob Perkins: My view is that the recent pricing and logistics issues are a transitory issue. The longer term issues and trends haven’t changed. This was a very, very cold winter and propane wasn’t in the right places.
Ethan Bellamy :  Excellent. Thank you very much.
 Robert W. Baird:  Excellent. Thank you very much.

Norman Kramer : Good morning Joe Bob, that was a really good quarter. My question revolves around ethane. Have you been getting enquiries regarding exports of ethanes and do you have any thoughts about this area of plans to think about going into this part of the business?
 Kramer Investments: Good morning Joe Bob, that was a really good quarter. My question revolves around ethane. Have you been getting enquiries regarding exports of ethanes and do you have any thoughts about this area of plans to think about going into this part of the business?
Joe Bob Perkins: We have had discussions about ethane exports. We understand the technology. We can do that. The challenges of an export project; start first with challenges on the other side of the water combined with a willingness both that customer to term up supply at Mont Belvieu-based pricing. If we received such a contract we would undertake such a project, and it will take a couple or three years to get it done after the announcement.
Norman Kramer : Okay, thank you for that. And a second question, I know from your presentations that you have I think three facilities on the ship channel. Are there any expansion plans on the other two that are in some sort of your thought process at this point?
 Kramer Investments: Okay, thank you for that. And a second question, I know from your presentations that you have I think three facilities on the ship channel. Are there any expansion plans on the other two that are in some sort of your thought process at this point?
Joe Bob Perkins: Well, taking them in order of activity, the Galena Park expansions have been going on for some time and we’ve got a little more land and a little more space and the ability to do more things in the future at Galena Park. Moving next to Channelview, great deal of activity, we acquired acreage after, we first acquired the project we have added tankage and we got other projects in the works. And I sort of addressed that relative to the condensate splitter question a little while ago. Patriot, we purchased, has less activity on it. But it's nicely located most likely to help with condensate splitter or other petroleum logistics opportunity, but could have some utilization associated with our LPG exports down the road, it’s nicely situated.
Norman Kramer : Okay. That does it for me. Thanks very much.
 Kramer Investments: Okay. That does it for me. Thanks very much.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you, Norman.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Michael Blum : Hi, good morning everybody.
 Wells Fargo Securities: Hi, good morning everybody.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning, Michael.
Michael Blum : Just a couple of quick questions really, one, you’ve just seen a lot of assets trade-ins in West Texas and the Permian. And I am just curious, if that’s changed anything from a competitor’s standpoint from your perspective or are your systems really just kind of captive to where you are sitting?
 Wells Fargo Securities: Just a couple of quick questions really, one, you’ve just seen a lot of assets trade-ins in West Texas and the Permian. And I am just curious, if that’s changed anything from a competitor’s standpoint from your perspective or are your systems really just kind of captive to where you are sitting?
Joe Bob Perkins: The major assets changing hands in the Permian have not really affected competitive landscape in my opinion, the big change is just so much activity in this giant trend going from vertical to horizontal. And there is a lot of room to go on that too, if you look at the percentage of horizontal in the Permian Basin. We like our position and we try to play primarily in, around and between those positions. SAOU nicely positioned on the East side of the Permian Basin, Sand Hills and what you might call sort of Southwest of the Permian Basin and we’re linking those two together, which really gives you sort of coverage and ability from the West side of Sand Hills all the way to the East side of SAOU. Then I’d like to mention Versado just because it’s so fun to see that throughput volume growing after waiting for the shale revolution to get to it and we’re expanding with pipe to underutilize processing capacity there.
Michael Blum : Thanks, and that’s very helpful. In the past you’ve talked about a shallow backlog of projects and I think the $1.5 billion type range. Obviously you’ve got the 650 for 2014. Has that number changed at all, is that still kind of in the range that you’re looking at?
 Wells Fargo Securities: Thanks, and that’s very helpful. In the past you’ve talked about a shallow backlog of projects and I think the $1.5 billion type range. Obviously you’ve got the 650 for 2014. Has that number changed at all, is that still kind of in the range that you’re looking at?
Joe Bob Perkins: Those are our official numbers right now, I think they’ve put out a new Q1 Investor Presentation on the web for this caller or immediately afterwards and that’s what those numbers will still reflect.
Michael Blum : Okay. And then my last question actually on that presentation, I was just curious if there was anything in that slide deck that can be different from our incremental to what’s been discussed on this call today.
 Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. And then my last question actually on that presentation, I was just curious if there was anything in that slide deck that can be different from our incremental to what’s been discussed on this call today.
Joe Bob Perkins: No, there should not be. I repeat.
Michael Blum :  Okay, good. Thank you. 
 Wells Fargo Securities:  Okay, good. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jon Yoder from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jon Yoder : 
 Goldman Sachs: 
 :
Joe Bob Perkins: There were ups and downs associated with that description. First on the Gathering & Processing side, plants performed very well considering the weather, but there was some impact during the cold waves. That impact was more than offset by sort of the unexpected strong performance not in the cold waves and pricing. Then the wholesale propane and our natural gas liquids logistics businesses, just worked very, very hard to try to help meet demand and there were some cost involved with that and there were some profits involved with that. I sort of gave a description of impact in Q4 that might not repeat in 2014 and it didn’t quite hit that list.
Jon Yoder : And as far as what you’re seeing in the first quarter has some of those trends kind of rolled through so far, what do you say?
 Goldman Sachs: And as far as what you’re seeing in the first quarter has some of those trends kind of rolled through so far, what do you say?
Joe Bob Perkins: We had a repeat of some of that in the first part of January.
Jon Yoder : And looking at the Bakken on the natural gas infrastructure side, are you guys -- how was the outlook there? I know obviously you have your hands full with your crude oil expansion program there, but in terms of adding on a processing plant or incremental infrastructure, what’s the outlook there?
 Goldman Sachs: And looking at the Bakken on the natural gas infrastructure side, are you guys -- how was the outlook there? I know obviously you have your hands full with your crude oil expansion program there, but in terms of adding on a processing plant or incremental infrastructure, what’s the outlook there?
Joe Bob Perkins:  Yes I guess in addition to saying that we were adding processing capacity, because that was large enough on the radar scope that we thought we should mention it, Board approved it outside our authority. We are -- we continue to be active along with needing more processing capacity you have to sort of -- we continue to add pipe and more importantly we’re adding compression that meet those customers’ needs and is that the color you were looking for?
Jon Yoder : Sure, yes I guess beyond the additional -- yeah that’s fine. Thanks.
 Goldman Sachs: Sure, yes I guess beyond the additional -- yeah that’s fine. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from John Edwards from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Edwards : Yes, good morning. Great quarter. Just following up the last question, so net was weather a positive or a negative on the fourth quarter? And so far in the first quarter has the net been positive or negative?
 Credit Suisse: Yes, good morning. Great quarter. Just following up the last question, so net was weather a positive or a negative on the fourth quarter? And so far in the first quarter has the net been positive or negative?
Joe Bob Perkins: I mean there is mix -- it would depend on whether you’re in a Field or you’re in the NGL marketing division. I mean if you look across the Field segment we report by area the volume and you’ll see slight incremental downs in North Texas, SAOU. The volumes were down 15 million a day across our Field and now has impacts of the Saunders fire as well as some weather impacts to the other areas. In the wholesale business it’s seasonal and we expect more margin to be earned in Q4 and Q1, but we don't necessarily get into the specifics of those, but if you can go back and look at historical quarters in trends?
Matt Meloy: I would say if you include the impact of price into weather, that you would have to say that weather was net positive to us, every way I’ve cut the numbers, but that’s because of the price part in there and because we performed very well despite really rugged temperatures, I’m proud of the operations.
John Edwards : Great. Thank you very much.
 Credit Suisse: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And I’m not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Joe Bob Perkins for any further remarks.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you operator and thank you everyone who attended, and for your patience on this call. We love talking about the business, hope we’ve covered the things you wanted to cover. If you have any other questions feel free to contact Jen, Matt or any of us. Good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

With that, I will turn it over to Matt Meloy.
Matthew J. Meloy: Thanks Jen. Welcome and thanks everyone for joining us today including those who are with us in Houston and those participating by via the webcast. As Jen mentioned I will start off with a review of and commentary on the third quarter 2013 and we will than move into financial and operational guidance for 2014. For those of you on the webcast I will be starting with slide five. Starting on slide five, the top graph. This is a record quarter for Targa as our third quarter adjusted EBITDA of a $156 million is the highest reported quarter ever and was 34% higher than the same time period last year. The increase was driven by higher volumes in natural gas and condensate prices and our gathering and processing division and higher fractionation volumes and fees and increased exports in our Logistics and Marketing Division. Our overall results show the benefits of diversity and increasing fee-based margin contributions. Fee-based margins exceeded 50% for the third straight quarter. Moving to the bottom graph, the operating margin was $200 million for the quarter, which is 24% higher than Q3 2012. Logistics and Marketing Division produced quarterly operating margin of $103 million, up 36% compared to the third quarter of last year, primarily driven by higher fractionation volumes, fractionation revenue at CBF along with increased LPG export and storage activity at our integrated Galena Park and Mont Belvieu facilities. We are pleased to announce that the first phase of our LPG export expansion at Galena Park and Mont Belvieu was completed earlier than expected and we began testing and commissioning in September. The expansion increases our export capacity to over 2 million barrels from 1 million to 1.5 million barrels a month to 3.5 million to 4 million barrels a month. In connection with start-up and commissioning of the export expansion, we loaded low ethane propane on one mid-sized vessel and two VLGCs in September. The Gathering and Processing division produced quarterly operating margin of $92 million, up 28% compared to the third quarter of 2012. As the combination of volume increases and higher natural gas and condensate prices more than offset the impact of a fire at the Saunders gas processing plant in the Versado system and a slight decline in NGL prices in the third quarter of 2013 versus the third quarter of 2012. Moving to page six, starting with the top graph, we saw increased activity across our Field Gathering and Processing divisions in third quarter over third quarter of 2012 had volume increases in both our field and coastal segments. Plant natural gas inlet volumes in our Field Gathering and Processing segment increased by 17% in the third quarter of 2013 versus same period last year led by a 30% increase at SAOU, a 26% increase in North Texas and the addition of the volumes from Badlands which was acquired at year-end 2012. This is the third quarter that we are reporting volumes from our Badlands systems. And Crude oil gathered increased by 37% to 52,400 barrels a day in the third quarter versus 38,300 barrels a day in the second quarter. You will note on this chart that NGL production shown by the triangle symbols also increased for both segments. And the graph also makes a point that not all inlet volumes are created equal but our Field segment having much more NGL production than our Coastal segment even with significantly less inlet volumes. On the bottom graph, same page, the increase in volumes coupled with higher natural gas and condensate prices resulted in a 28% increase in gathering and processing operating margins. These increases were partially offset by slightly lower NGL prices, higher operating expenses due to additional compression and maintenance costs associated with system expansion and the addition of Badlands as well as the fire at the Saunders plant.
 : Moving now to page seven, starting with the top graph. The fractionation volumes increased by 8% in the third quarter of 2013 versus the same time period last year, CBF Train 4 was operational during the quarter and we were able to work through some of the inventory build-up that occurred during the second quarter as a result of maintenance and inspection turnaround at CBF Trains 1, 2, and 3. As previously mentioned, in September we began testing and commissioning our LPG export expansion at Galena Park. The increased capacity of the facility contributed export volumes averaging 1.7 million barrels a month in the third quarter, a 77% increase versus second quarter 2012 average volumes of about 1 million barrels a month. Treating volumes were substantially lower in the third quarter 2013 due to facility impact associated with the start-up of our LPG export expansion. Now on the bottom graph of Page 7, the increased activity across the Logistics and Marketing division resulted in a 36% increase in operating margin in the third quarter 2013 versus Q3 2012 with Logistics up 40% and Marketing and Distribution up 30%. The increase in margin was largely driven by factors already discussed including higher fractionation revenue and increased export activity. The increased margin from fractionation activity was partially offset by factors associated with the startup and commissioning of Train 4 at CBF. Moving to Page 8. The top graph, you’ll see distributable cash flow for the quarter was approximately $111 million, 44% increase over the third quarter 2012 and resulted in distribution coverage of over one-time based on our third quarter declared distribution of $0.7325 or $2.93 on an annual basis. In the bottom graph, as you can see in the chart, distribution coverage for both Q3 2013 and Q3 2012 was approximately one-time. As you will recall, this coverage profile is consistent with our 2013 guidance for distribution coverage being lower in the first half of the year in about one-times for the full year. Even with Q3 declared distribution, a 11% higher than Q3 2012, we expect continued coverage improvements in Q4, driven by the ramp up of contributions from the first phase of the LPG expansion and continued contributions from projects such as CBF Train 4. Moving to Page 9, the top graph, you’ll see capital expenditures were about $267 million in the third quarter of 2013 compared to a $145 million for the same period last year. The 84% increase was driven by all of our high quality growth projects including the commissioning of CBF Train 4, the initial phase of our LPG export expansions and ongoing construction of the High Plains and Longhorn processing plants in the second phase of our export expansions. From the bottom graph, you’ll see net maintenance capital expenditures were $16 million in the third quarter of 2013 compared to $14 million in the third quarter of 2012. The increase in maintenance CapEx is consistent with increased activity, higher volumes and higher capacity utilizations across our businesses. For the full year 2013 net maintenance capital expenditures is expected to be approximately $80 million. Moving to Page 10, the top graph, shifting to a few brief remarks about TRC’s third quarter. At TRC third quarter 2013 distributable cash flow of $36 million was 62% higher than the same time period last year and resulted in dividend coverage of 1.5 times. The higher than expected coverage is a result of an overpayment of taxes in 2012 that is being applied to 2013 cash taxes. On the bottom graph, you’ll note that TRC third quarter dividend of $0.57 or $2.28 annualized represents a 35% increase compared to the third quarter 2012. That concludes our review of the third quarter 2013 reported results. We will now give an update on our 2013 financial and operational guidance and review our guidance for 2014. 2013 has been an exciting time to target as we have seen some of our high growth projects come on line, on budget and on or ahead of schedule and we have been working hard on a number of other projects that will contribute in 2014 and beyond. So moving now to Page 12, starting with the top graph, you’ll see adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months through the third quarter was a record $545 million. In the fourth quarter 2012, we provided a 2013 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $595 million to $655 million. At this point in the year, we believe the adjusted EBITDA will likely be in a lower end of that range even with the number of factors that have impacted performance this year including slower than originally estimated ramp of Badland volumes, lower volumes of Y-Grade to fractionate due to ethane rejections at some of our customers processing plants, third-party incidence impacting volumes at Besco, supplier at the Saunders processing facility in the Versado systems, permitting delays which move the expected completions of a Longhorn plant to 2014. Despite these impactful factors, we still anticipate meeting the EBITDA guidance provided a year ago, which underscores the strong performance across all our businesses. Now in the bottom graph. Thus far in 2013, we have spent $667 million on growth capital expenditures. For 2013, we anticipate spending a total of approximately $900 million. Our previous guidance for 2013 was total growth CapEx of $990 million, but we expect actual spending will be slightly lower. We are pleased to confirm that both CBF Train 4 and Phase I of the LPG exports came in on or under budget in early, our overall CapEx was also impacted by the permitting delays around the Longhorn plant, which moves some expected 2013 spending into 2014. Similarly, some of the expected Badlands CapEx for 2013 shifted to 2014. For 2014, we have currently announced plans with $590 million of growth capital spending, which maybe conservative if we are successful at some of the projects we currently have under development that are not included in our guidance. As previously mentioned, we now expect to spend approximately $80 million in maintenance capital expenditures net Targa interest in 2013 and approximately $90 million in 2014. Moving to Page 13, we are maintaining 2013 guidance on distribution growth at 10% to 12% at TRP and then expect to continue our track record of top tier growth into 2014. We’re announcing distribution growth guidance of 7% to 9% at TRP for 2014. As mentioned earlier, TRP distribution coverage for the third quarter was one-time. For full-year 2013 and 2014, we expect coverage to be approximately one-times as well. As our scale and diversity and fee based business continue to increase, we believe that our long-term coverage target of 1.1 times to 1.2 times is appropriate. Now on the bottom graph same page, we are maintaining 2013 guidance on dividend growth in excess of 30% at TRP and expect to continue to grow our track record of top tier growth into 2014. Our dividend growth guidance for 2014 at TRP is in excess of 25% over 2013. Moving now to Page 14, top graph. The graph on this page effectively illustrates how Targa has had stable to increasing EBITDA through periods of high volatility in crude, natural gas and NGL pricing. As I mentioned on the prior page, the prices we used for the 2014 guidance are $95 of barrel crude oil, $3.75 in MMBtu of Henry Hub Natural Gas and $0.90 of gallon weighted average NGL price and we also included overall NGL price sensitivity for 2014. Every $0.05 a gallon increase or decrease in weighted average NGL prices equals about a 2% change in 2014 estimated adjusted EBITDA. On Page 15 now, our fee-based margin contributions were record $113 million in Q3 2013 and fees have provided greater than 50% of our operating margin in every quarter in 2013. We expect our fee-based margin to continue to increase and estimate that 60% to 65% of operating margin will be fee-based during 2014. Joe Bob is going to discuss our major capital project later in the presentation, but I did want to emphasize the point that 72% of our announced project that will be completed in 2013 and 2014 are predominantly fee-based. Moving to Page 16, top graph, as of September 30th you see we had total liquidity of $824 million. In the third quarter, we’ve received gross proceeds of approximately $118 million from common equity issuances under our aftermarket equity programs, which allow us to periodically sell equity at prevailing market prices. Year-to-date we have now raised approximately $383 million of gross proceeds under this program. We are very pleased with a success of the program through three quarters of this year and believe that subject to market conditions we could potentially use the ATM program to meet our equity needs for the remainder of this year and for 2014. Total funded debt on September 30 was approximately $2.8 billion and our third quarter compliance debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 4 times. We expect this ratio to continue to improve through 2014 and expect to be comfortably within the three to four times range by the end of 2014 while continuing our 50% debt, 50% equity target funding on growth capital expenditures. On to Page 17, the table on 17 provides the summary of our guidance for 2010. We have already covered a number of these items this morning and we will discuss the other such as CapEx and operating steps later in the presentation. That concludes my review of the third quarter 2013 and overview of 2014 guidance. We will now move in to our 2013 investor and analyst presentation and I’ll begin by giving an overview of Targa and we’ll then discuss some of the current industry trends and impact on TRP before turning it over to Joe Bob, who will provide additional highlights related to the partnerships footprint, operation and opportunities. Okay, on to Page 19. I want to give a brief overview of the Targa Corporate structure. As you can see there are two publicly traded companies under the Targa umbrella: Targa Resources Corp which has a NYSE ticker TRGP also referred to as TRC and Targa Resources Partners LP, NYSE ticker NGLS or referred to as TRP. TRC does not own any operating assets and its only source of revenue is from its general limited partner interest including incentive distribution rights in TRP. TRC owns 11.9% limited partner interest at 2% general partner interest in TRP and the IDRs. As illustrated all of Targa’s operating assets are owned by TRP shown in the grey box segments and bullet point business units and are split into two divisions: Gathering and Processing and Logistics and Marketing. Currently TRPs operating margin split equally between the two divisions. All of Targa’s publicly traded debt is issued by TRP and TRPs senior notes are currently rated Ba3 by Moody’s and BB by S&P. For our public debt ratings, we continue to deliver on all fronts relative to expectation that we’d laid out for the rating agencies, completion and commercialization of CBF Train 4 in the first phase of our export expansion project are important for the agencies and we look forward to giving them an update when we visit with them prior to the end of the year. Moving to Page 20. There are two ways to invest in Targa. TRP is a master limited partnership that completed its initial public offering in February 2007. TRP pays quarterly tax distributions and issues K-1 to investors. TRP is the owner and operator of all the operating assets is currently trading at about a 6% yield and has a current enterprise value of approximately 8.4 billion. TRC went public in December 2010 and is a C-Corp. TRC pays quarterly tax dividends and issues 10.99 to investors. TRC is currently trading at a 3% yield and has an enterprise value of approximately 3.4 billion. As you can see from the graph at the bottom of the page, TRP and TRC have both generated very attractive returns for investors, which we’ll discuss in more detail on the next page. So moving to page 21, you can see that steady sequential quarter-over-quarter growth in TRP’s annualized distributions for LP units on the graph at the top right of the page. Given TRP’s position as an MLP with top tier growth, it’s not surprising that TRP has outperformed the Alerian Index by more than 50% since the beginning of 2010. The graph at the bottom left demonstrates TRC’s strong performance since the IPO. And TRC has outperformed the AMZ, S&P 500 and Utilities Index year-after-year. We’re proud of the strong returns that TRP and TRC have generated for investors and believe that there is ample opportunity for continued distribution and dividend growth going forward. Let’s now turn to discuss some current industry dynamics and the impact on Targa. Page 23, if we start and take a brief look at rig count, there are some key shifts that have taken place reflecting significant changes in the broader energy industry. In the mid-2000s producers begin to have some success using techniques such as horizontal drilling and multi-stage fracking to unlock some of the tight shale rock that have never been successfully produced before. One indicator of the shifting focus is the increase in horizontal drilling versus vertical drilling. Horizontal drilling now accounts for over 60% of U.S. rig activity. Natural gas producing regions or initially the focus for producers using horizontal drilling techniques, producers then started to apply similar techniques in oil and liquids rich shale plays with continued success. Producers have continued to shift more and more resources to oil and liquids rich basins and currently about 80% of drilling activity is focused on oil production. This is the trend that we expect continue going forward. Moving to Page 24, the potential result of continued producer activity in oil and liquids rich basin is illustrated on Page 24, as crude production in the U.S. is expected to increase over the foreseeable future. The EIA’s base case projection estimates crude production of 7.5 million barrels by the end of 2020 with a high case projection of 10 million barrels. Current domestic production has already exceeded the EIA’s base case expectations. The majority of increase over the next decade is expected from tight oil resource plays like those in the Permian and Wilson basin where TRP has well positioned expanding footprints. One impact of increased crude and liquids focused activity in domestic shale plays drives more NGL supply from field production. Using forecast from a variety of sources, we estimate that between 2012 and 2017 there could be about a 50% increase in U.S. NGL supply. Increasing up steam crude NGL and associated natural gas will drive demand for additional mid-stream and downstream infrastructure. Targa has benefited and we believe we’ll continue to benefit as more highly efficient processing plants, fractionation services and increased export activities are needed across the country. Now on Page 25, you can see TRPs geographic diversity, and our Gathering and Processing division is intentional. Our Permian and Bakken systems are located in two of the lowest cost producing crude basins, which as a result are two of the basins with the most active rigs running. The Permian has more than 460 rigs currently running, and is the most active basin in the U.S. The Williston Basin is the third most active basin in the U.S. with 183 rigs currently running. Our North Texas system is located in the liquids rich window, the Barnett Shale and our Coastal Gathering and Processing assets are well situated for the longer term potential ramp up in Gulf of Mexico activities. We have intentionally targeted oil and liquids rich basins for our Gathering and Processing activity, producer activity around our Field G&P systems have driven expansions that will increase our growth processing capacity by approximately 50% from the year-end 2012 to year-end 2014. On Page 26, TRP has the second largest fractionation position in the hub of the NGL market activity Mont Belvieu, Texas. NGLs from around the country flow to Mont Belvieu in various pipeline conversions and expansions are trying to get additional volumes connected to the country’s NGL hub. In addition to our fractionation footprint, TRP has one of only two operating commercial LPG export facilities connected to Mont Belvieu. TRP’s overall footprint in and around Mont Belvieu includes fractionation, storage, connectivity to supply pipeline and the petrochemical complex in an export terminal. We expect to have continued opportunities for growth in this part of the downstream business as additional volumes flow to the Gulf Coast and drive demand for downstream services.
 : 2013 has been a big year for TRP and we’ve already seen the initial benefits for some of our organic CapEx projects going into service, and we are announcing guidance with continued strong distribution growth as more projects go into service in 2014 and beyond. TRC, our general partner continues to benefit from TRP’s rapid growth and we expect dividend growth in excess of 25% for 2014. We are excited about what’s going on in our industry and what that means for Targa. I will now turn it over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning, everyone. Kind of a mic check. We made a last minute audible that neither Matt nor I could get down to this one and sort of working on the lapel mic. Is everything okay? And they tell me that it’s working for the people on the phone as well. But still, so I’m happy to be talking with you today. If you pick the head I’ve got almost as much materials to cover as Mike has already covered, and I’m going to try to stay with the highlights that I could see here on Page 27. That really is the one page story. So if you fall asleep in the middle of my presentation come back to 27 and those are the headlines. I guess I’ll just start with a pretty good slide. Value creation for TRP since the 2007 IPO. We are proud of what we’ve accomplished. If you look at the top left hand chart capital spending from 2007 to today, there is only two eras. First, 2007 through 2010 when we were doing dropdowns and selected investments at the same time on growth capital. Then 2011 through 2014 we shifted, we shifted as the industry shifted to keep up with the demand, but we shifted to a lot of organic investments and selected acquisitions that are driving growth now and in the future. Our strategy from 2007 through 2011 really backed when we founded the company has been the same. The strategy of acquiring selected strategic assets in good locations has the right price. Taking those assets, better utilizing and better commercializing them and then constantly looking for new opportunities that play to our strength that’s the strategy we started with, that’s the strategy we’re doing today and that’s the strategy we’re going to do tomorrow. It worked pretty well. Chart on the top right shows the value creations since IPO. IPO there is about $1 valuation and has grown to as Matt said $8.4 billion towards an enterprise value. That’s a significant increase and value above the capital that we put in it. The chart shares that there is $2.2 billion worth of value creation above that IPO value above the capital that was invested in the business, but that doesn’t include $1.1 billion worth of cash distributed to TRP investors along the way. So the total value creation the $3.3 billion since the IPO of TRP and we’re proud of that track record. Page 30 has a lot of words on it. 2013 as we said this time last year was going to be a transformative year and it really has been. As I said our business strategy has been consistent. We’re investing in gathering and processing. We’re investing in the downstream. We’re effectively executing across a very diverse business mix and we’re identifying and developing new opportunities all the time. I’m proud of execution in 2013 where we put $900 million of growth CapEx to work this year, we make plant additions, CBF Train 4 has been brought on, the LPG export facility has been expanded successfully and the Badlands acquisition has been integrated in growing, so great execution for 2013. Looking forward by the end of this year, right now frankly, we are very well positioned. Fee-based margin as Matt said is 50 some thing percent and going up to 60 something percent. Those next few dot points talk about execution across the diverse business. And then we look at a strong financial position and strong guidance for 2014, where 2014s EBITDA will be 25% plus our 2013 EBITDA. It’s a transformative year, but there’s a lot in front of us. Now, if we look back to the IPO in 2007, I see many people in the room remember that 2007 looked a lot different. I mean the pie chart illustrates, we were a gathering and processing company only with one asset in North Texas and essentially no non fee-based, essentially all non fee-based revenue. North Texas was our MLP. Fast forward to that today looking sort of three quarters through 2013 and that business mix with half gathering and processing half down strength. Gathering and processing have caused multiple basins, frankly some of the best places. Our downstream business across fractionation and exports and projects that are driving fee-based revenues much different look 60% fee-based pretty soon. It says 54% looking back of our shoulder. That’s a diverse robust business, a whole lot better than just the North Texas assets will be up when public. Next page, page 32 shows ours major announced capital projects, we’ve been using a chart like this for several years and what we do after things become announced, improved and put them on this chart, we rack them up and we show people what we are doing with it. We’ve got approximately $1.9 billion worth of projects coming on in 2013 and 2014. If you sort of look at the columns you can see that in 2013 we spent about $900 million by the end of the year and give new guidance for 2014 based only on these approved projects were about $600 million. If you look across the entire page line items and columns you can see diverse spending across all of these projects creating and adding to our diverse business mix. About $0.5 are being spent on the Gathering and Processing side, about $0.5 in total are being spent on the downstream side and as Matt said over 70% of those dollars on this page are being spent for projects that contributes a fee-based revenue. Now every time we cover this chart, people sort of know these projects well and the first question is what next. On page 33 is the simplified version of what’s next. Some of this is public, because you can see that in permit, so you can see it in projects or our customers and are taking about it. That short project list, I just kind of what to talk to, so you get a feel for it. In the Badlands and I’ll talk about the Badlands in a minute. We’ve got additional gas processing opportunities in front of us. We’ve got one plant working, we just commissioned another plant. That’s had a little bit of start-up issues, but we are looking at the third plant and will probably happen in 2014. The Badlands expansion programs, we talk about how many dollars on the first page we’ll be spending next year on identifying projects, but we’ll be spending dollars beyond those identified projects in the Badlands, Permian expansion program and likewise. We’ll be putting in place a pipe that my Board hasn’t approved yet, maybe plants that my Board hasn’t improved yet because there is so much going on there and we’ll talk about that in a little bit. CBF Train 5 expansion, I don’t’ know how many earnings call that’s been asked. When is that the permit is going to pop out. And I’m going to say again recognizing that our Federal Government has disappointed me in the past that I expect that permit to be out by the end of the year. Winning conversations and that’s our expectation. CBF Train 6 is on the drawing board here too. We’ve got room for it. Mike’s acquired property quietly for years to make sure that we have, I’ll show you how proud that there stage for five and six. And there is underground storage space sufficient for five and six. Another projects are always on the drawing board and we don’t talk about them until we approve them. And sometimes they are smaller message you don’t even hear about them, that drives our EBITDA on the future. This looks the projects will move from this chart to the chart previous as they get approved that’s what we always do, and the list of projects is not on this chart, looks a whole lot like this list of projects. We expect there to be additional investment opportunities as we go forward. I thought I was through with projects, but I had instructions in pictures right. The top picture is our Mont Belvieu CBF fractionation facility. Looks pretty crowded, if you look real close on the chart you can see activity in cranes. We’ve been busy out there for quite some time and believe it or not there is some green space and there is sufficient planning for CBF Train 5after we get a permit, after we come up with a commercial deals that we want to drive that and even room for CBF Train 6 if there is demand for, it is crowded. I’d like to picture on the bottom first. This is the picture of first phase of the LPG export facility actually in action that is not a photoshop shoot through putting a photoshop shoot in there before, that’s a real VLGC in the front ground. Our business before was medium size and small ships, I remember I was talking about that, 1 million to 1.5 million barrels of exports with the medium size of small ships they are in the background there. Through the medium size of small ships, the next two ships above that VLGC that gives you a little bit of scale on what the difference is on our new projects versus our old projects. All are important, we’ll continue to do the other business just as we do a lot business with VLGC. There was a conference just recently where I guess to show the first ship that was coming in with high in the water and one of the analysts looking at that ship says that ship is hungry for LPG because it was rising high in the water and I said that was a pretty good comment. I need to pause for a minute. Our environmental safety and help is a lot more important to us than our employees probably than it is he is an investor, but for he is an investor it’s important. They don’t want a company that’s doing the wrong thing, we do the right thing. We spend a lot more time talking with our employees about the stuff than we do with our investors, but our performance is pretty going strong. For example, if we compare with our GPI peers and that’s a good group, I guess our GPI peers were far better than average. We get awards and honors all the time and we are always looking for ways to be more better on the environmental front than we always look. I want to take a deeper dive into a few gathering and processing highlights. Starting with the Permian Basin, if we could only choose one basin to be in which is the Permian Basin. Permian Basin is the second largest oil fields in the world according to the footnote that we referenced there. Truly it’s an amazing place to be doing business. Targa’s assets across that basin are part of the active production, taking advantage of active drilling in the Spraberry, Wolfcamp, Wolfberry, Cline, Canyon, Sands, Bone Spring and Avalon shale, very, very active. If you look at the bottom left hand corner, Permian Basin permitting activity shown since 2006, which you could go further back it’s up into the right and I expect it continue to be up into the right. Permian Basin drilling activity in the chart on the top right shows very high activity 400 to 500 rigs over time, it’s not flattening now. Look at the blue lines, the blue line has horizontal rigs increasing steadily over that period of time, which is a multiplier effect, because horizontal rigs have a higher rig effectiveness than those rigs we were looking at on the left hand side of the chart. So permitting activity and drilling activity and advances and technology are driving the bottom right hand chart, production going up into the right, crude oil, NGL, natural gas from this oil driven basin. Page 38, is forecast, there is a lot of details in these forecast. I don’t want to take you through you can look at it latter by producer or by hydrocarbons, all of the forecast for the Permian Basin show continued activity in growing production. Many of them, I’m not even saying most of them are showing the Permian Basin growing to 5 million barrels of oil equivalent by the mid-20s. In the chart at the bottom of this for example, shows decades of growth. Let’s talk about Targa’s presence in the Permian Basin on Page 39. You can see three major systems across the Permian Basin. They extend from the east side of the Permian basin to the west side of the Permian basin and down into the Southwest of the basin. We’re active across all of those active plays shown in different colors. We’re not dependent on the single producer, not dependent on a single play, not dependent on the single area and in all three of those areas SAOU, Sand Hills and Versado are expecting to have endless volumes meaningfully higher in 2014 than 2013. Life is good for us in the Permian Basin. The recent expansions that you all are well aware of 60 million cubic feet a day in total, they’re essentially full. We’re building the 200 million cubic feet a day plant, the High Plains plant sort of shown in the center of the chart. And we expect more investment opportunities over time. Broadening our footprint, extending pipe to where the drilling has been done from our system, better utilizing the capacity that we have or the capacity we’re having and then perhaps expanding or adding plants over time. Really just giving our share of that activity in the Permian Basin those of you who follow EMP companies know about. I want to talk about each of those three areas quickly, so you got a better feel for what’s going on there. Page 40 starts with SAOU, so called San Angelo Operating Unit, we never say that full term, SAOU is located on the east side of the Permian Basin. The activity around SAOU is robust. These little red triangles represent a snapshot in the middle of October of how many rigs we’re running, drilling rigs not work over rigs. SAOU is an extensive system, multiple plants and we’re adding a big one around the western side now and like I said 2014 volumes will be meaningfully higher than 2013. Switching to Sand Hills on the next page, Sand Hills is located sort of the Southwestern part of the Permian Basin. It covers the large area of extent as you can see. The same red triangles represent producer drilling rig activity and its all across the system. My guess would be those over on the east side, not guess I know, those on the east side our drilling for Wolfberry. Those in the west side are drilling for Bone Spring. There are some conventional drilling in the center. And the volumes year-to-date for Sand Hills are up from last year and the volumes from 2014 will be meaningfully better than 2013. The third area is Versado. Last but not least I’ll get to that in a minute. For contacts by the way Matt mentioned the fire that’s the Saunders facility at the top of the page, it’s the smallest of the three plants not a meaningful impact and it will be back up in December if you don’t believe me you [indiscernible]. Really an extraordinary job putting it back together and I am very proud of the employee effort on that. Back to the activity levels. This is recent activity. Those of you who follow this for a while I remember three to five years ago we’ve talked about Versado not very, very much about it and when asked about the volume say wells will be a little less than last year. I said that for several years. Two years ago, we were able to stay flat, the volumes that we’re started, we’re hanging in there. They were flat. Last year, we said flat to increasing with that. I am really proud to say meaningfully higher for Versado for 2014. And we’ve got available capacity and it’s probably our fee based expansion in the Company, it does not cost much. Clark White feels good about this too as all the employees hope we call Versado. North Texas growth overview, shifting to North Texas, North Texas located around Dallas, Fort Worth. Someone said the view out of the hotel here looked better than Dallas when I first walked up. Active area indications of that activity are showing in the top left chart. So, let did North Texas well. Here, I can get the close to proxy of our combo Barnett area by looking at Montague, Cook, Clay and Wise Counties. So that’s part of the Barnett is not accurate. But Montague, Cook, Clay and Wise Counties, as proxy for that wet part, so permitting activity that’s 2005 drilling and that’s high. Now we know that activity has less than it would be, so many opportunities on the Permian Basin. The people have sort of diverting their resources. But the good news is there are still producers very focused on this and we’re benefiting from that. This shows that snapshot of that activity, where we are in the middle of October again, most of the activity in the top right hand corner that is the wet part of the Barnett Shale. Volume increases here are being driven by the wet part of the Barnett Shale and by the Marble Falls. Marble Falls is the same source of the rock is the Barnett Shale, but is actually a dewatering oil play and been contributing to our growth. As other ship resources, there is still some companies focused here. Shifting from North Texas to North Dakota, where our Badlands system is located; our system is located in McKenzie, Dunn and Mountrail counties. Assuming then on the McKenzie, Dunn and Mountrail counties, we can look at selective permits on the bottom left hand corner on Page 45, that permitting activity is up into the right, since over the last three years. There is no slacking off in those three counties in terms of the activity as indicated by the leading indicator of Permian activity. It’s a little harder to see rig activity in North Dakota by counties, but if you look across the basin, rig activity hanging in there in the sort of 150 to 200 rigs. But that’s not the whole story. As producers largely are moving to manufacturing mode and pad drilling and pad completion, a flat number of rigs is actually an increasing number of effective rigs, if I can use that term. The result of the permitting and the drilling, and advances and completion techniques and more formations becoming productive is Bakken Three Forks oil production going strongly up and into the right in the bottom left hand corner of the graph. And there are lots of forecast out there, I wouldn’t go into the details of this forecast either not know I can read the type in those boxes. But if you look at forecasts, most forecasts show oil production doubling in this area over the next 10 years. 2013 has really been a game changer I think and inflection point, if I we’re drilling the box with little arrows and we sort of still this one, when I would say is 2013 is manufactures shifting from delineation and research projects to manufacturing lists and that shift is now occurring. It’s about still increasing technology, improving the IPs and the type curves by sub regions refracting the curve. It’s about improved expectations you can see that from the producers in the area. There is going to be more completions for drilling unit, the IP is a high operating completion than they expected and the reserves are higher than were expected a couple of years ago. So that’s the game changer we’re talking about in summary. So now zeroing a bit on our Badlands facilities. Our first one is the deal with something that’s in the disclosure of [indiscernible] contingent. The so called contingent consideration associated with Badlands. In quarter three, we estimated this liability that we had to put on our books to zero. That’s completely consistent with what we thought it was going to be when we acquired the property part of the deal was if you got to a certain level, we would have to pay an additional amount to the seller. That was a very low probability. Now with a passage of a little time and satisfying accounting rule, we can put that to where it was and by the way that does impact the adjusted EBITDA that we’ve been talking about. So much for that. I mean to go over pages 47 and 48 together talking primarily off the math. So a lot of words on those two pages what I’ll say is consistent with that text and you can read that later I guess. We acquired Targa Badlands nine months ago, spent the last three quarters – 10 months ago, spent the last three quarters working hard to execute our strategy, working hard to execute that strategy with some difficulty and this is a brand new acquisition. We’ve experienced the challenges that we frame new acquisitions, operating them and based on the features we did have difficult winter and spring weather and we told you all about that. There are issues with the quality of producer operations up there too as they’re struggling to work with their own new infrastructure. Producers have difficulties splitting oil and gas lines, but doesn’t do a lot of processing plants. The problems with their quality of gas setting their gas lines. But we’re working through it, working through with them and improving those operations. We’ve experienced some slow and difficult lot of ways there are too as well. And if you talk to other and mid-stream companies you’ll know that most difficult one is reservation. We are dealing with our boom town up there. Boom town levels of activity and the difficulties getting people and working with regulators and governments and the tribe these also dealing with that same rapid growth. Probably it’s almost down a whole lot below beyond their expectations but it has been a lot of hard work. However, we feel that is good or better or about this properties and when we acquired it. So the reason I sort of alluded to. The math shows the general footprint. I’m going to take you through it, and we start with a Little Missouri processing plant. Located in the middle of McKenzie, Dunn and Mountrail County the very good place for being that plant location had a 20 million cubic feet a day operating and actually we operating it when we visited it plant when we acquired it. That plant had some design defects that we had scrapped and make it work better. That plant that was in progress with some constructions less. We have got one finished. And after considerable effort we got both plants running much closer to way we would run a plant somewhere else. From left to right, so I’d also should mention the Little Missouri processing plant required 40 acres right across the road premise for the third plant an indication our potential to help on the gas side as well. We’re still evaluating that plan as I mentioned earlier, what’s the right size, what’s the right time and probably happens in 2014. From the left side of the map, our Alexander Terminal is a crude terminal with 30,000 barrels of tank capacity and improving into our connection capability to enrich North Dakota pipeline an important spot for many of our customers. Further east the Johnsons Corner terminal now has 40,000 barrels of tank capacity is interconnecting to three pipelines Tesoro, Four Bears and BakkenLink and providing truck and other rail capability. We’ve now got three lines going to five lines – truck lines for trucks to rail for our customers. At and around the Johnsons Corner terminals and Alexander Terminal, we’ve been adding flexibility and interconnections for our customers to get those places even as their desire of what place they want to get to changes on a monthly basis. And that’s just what it looks like in North Dakoda right now was somewhat indifferent to where they move it and our movement by pipe is a whole lot better than movement across the base that portion of the basin by truck. Since closing, the acquisition about 10 months ago, we’ve also been expanding the pipeline footprint. You can see that pipeline footprint it’s on the scale that really isn’t precise to have to be more indicative and that’s good because some of those gas lines are still getting right away from and I want them to know exactly where it is. The solid red lines are completed oil lines. The solid blue lines are completed gas lines and the dash is represents projects and process. Those projects and process maybe adding right away, they maybe under constructions, they may even be done and we haven’t updated the map. But that progress in terms of pipeline miles is important. We acquired this system with 300 miles of pipeline. First of the year that about how much oil and gas pipelines were in place after multiple years by the previous owners. By the end of 2014, we were more than doubled those miles of pipes. More specifically in 2013, which is almost over we will have had – we’ll have put in place about 200 miles a little bit more of pipe on top of the 306. We estimate that based on our known projects in 2014, we’ll put in place another 130 miles. So by the end of 2014, across dedicated acreage with our first mover advantage we’ll have 640 or some odd miles of price in place, benefiting from producer capital investment. Our system as the facilitator, the producer spending, the producer drilling or what drives the growth of oil volumes and gas volumes through our system and the drivers of that producer capital investment are pretty obvious. And as I mentioned, they are better than when we acquired. You can look at producer, public information about the number of completions per drilling units, the IT for each completion, the reserve for each completion, all significantly above by micro regions what we were expecting when we first acquired this. So that’s why we feel very good about for this project that we are having to complete. As an example of increased expectations and I’m not going to get into reserves and I’m not going to get into initial productions. But as an example, several producers are saying publicly and telling us that they may have 16 wells for 1280 acre drilling units. That’s more than double what we were assuming when we acquired the stuff.
 : Of course the Badlands EBITDA, the Badlands performance is embedded in our overall TRP EBITDA growth guidance and in our overall distribution growth guidance. And because we get the question so often, we reaffirm – I hate reaffirming, we reaffirm our guidance as this acquisition is accretive during 2014. That completes the gathering and processing highlights, and I’ll switch to our downstream highlights beginning again a little bit with our context. Page 50 shows NGL supply flows, which certainly continue to increase to the Gulf Coast in Mont Belvieu. The reason why, there is a chart at the bottom left-hand corner, and so the [indiscernible] 80% in North America is down there, that’s where the NGLs need to go. Matt touched briefly on the graph at the top left hand corner, and just touching on a couple of other things about it. We’ve got questions.
– : I should also mention that with respect to y-grade moving around differently than it has, y-grade potentially coming from the Northeast to the Gulf Coast, ethane rejection occurring in at various spots at area around Mont Belvieu need to get more flexible at handling a range of y-grade through its fractionation expansion facilities and you’ll probably be hearing a lot about that. So Mont Belvieu is the demand center. Page 51, says that Targa is very well positioned in and around Mont Belvieu. In and around Mont Belvieu meaning all the way to the ship channel. Page provides a summary of a lot of assets. Interconnected assets between our Mont Belvieu and Cedar Bayou Fractionator that sits on top of the valuable short-term storage and between Galena Park, which sits on the Houston Ship Channel. It shows details on fractionation and treating assets, underground storage, pipeline connectivity to supply end customers, terminals and docks, and very importantly the interconnected export facility. These all work together and it’s very difficult to replicate anyone of them that alone the combination, the one we say it’s difficult to replicate our assets that’s what we mean. Page 52, provides a little more context that I wanted to touch on. In 2012, it’s about 40% of fuel production flow to Mont Belvieu. This chart is trying to show industry NGL supply and Y-grade pipeline capacity. A lot going now, let me explain, what’s in there a little bit. First of all the blue shaded area represents pipeline capacity, back in 2012 pipeline capacity fractionation, NGL supply were kind of all in saying after first fixing pipelines and fixing fractionation. Pipeline capacity continues to go on and you can see pipeline capacity exceeding the other two lines. The blue represents a third parties estimates of Y-grade to Mont Belvieu, which we don’t believe includes the announced pipeline projects coming from the Northeast and apparently reflects some significant ethane rejection as we look at the numbers impacting the incoming volumes, we agree there is significant ethane rejection occuring. The orange line represents a third-party estimate of Mont Belvieu based fractionation capacity, which includes announced projects like Targa’s CBF Train 5, which is still in permitting, but probably very likely. And you see that the yellow line gets a little bit above the blue line in 2014, a little bit more above it in 2015, 2014 looks about like take or pay levels on average to me. 2015 looks like utilization maybe a little bit below those take or pay levels. Beyond 2015, we continue to have supply increases, but starting in 2016 2017, we expect demand increases as well which will bring ethane into that mix, further increasing the supply picture. So some temporary perhaps less than utilization and my longer-term forecast would be need for additional fractionation over time. Let’s turn to Page 53, also for context shifting to world’s LPG export supply and demand, get this sort of question often, so I want to quickly touch on the basics here. First of all what regions we’re exporting LPGs, you can see some of the major ones there, certainly the Middle East being an important player. You see the U.S. share of exports 2011 through this year growing, 6%, 8%, 14%. Even with that increasing market share over time, the U.S. share of worldwide waterborne LPG is expected to be less than 20% by 2020, so it’s not beginning to get too large on a world scale and by the way where does it sits on the cost curve, sits by comparison, first we should look at who are those other large propane exporters are. U.S. larger than any single country in the Middle East that you have multiple other Middle East countries, seeing at Norway, Algeria, Kuwait, Venezuela, Nigeria relative to our cost curve, the U.S. is lower cost than many of those to the right. Now where are those exports going? The chart at the bottom left shows you some of the regions in Latin America, Northwest, Europe the Far East, the U.S. LPG exports primarily have been going to Mexico, South America and Europe, and you look at waterborne reports, increasingly particularly with the Panama Canal completion, you’re seeing some of those exports going to the far east as well. So moving to our specific capacity. Our Targa’s export capabilities in Galena Park were in the middle of $480 million expansion project. We’ve gotten a nice chunk of it already done. If you look back to the second quarter, before September what we were doing was HD-5 and butane at about a 1 million barrels to a 1.5 million barrels a month. As of September, we can do low ethane propane again HD-5 and butane at a rate of a combined 3.5 million barrels to 4 million barrels per month. The work that’s still going on already started for the second Phase of the export project or add at least 2 million barrels, bringing total capacity to 5.5 million barrels to 6 million barrels a month. I would also say that from the first of the year through the third quarter when that second phase is supposed to be completed, we’ll be bringing additional capacity to bear as we do pieces of the work in that – and that adds capability. With that I think I covered our upstream highlights, our downstream highlights. We have a satellite picture of all of our operations and hopefully a summary of some of the points that we made today. With that I’d like to turn it over to questions. Operator would you queue those up please.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions) And our first question comes from James Jampel from HITE. Please go ahead.
James Jampel – HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC: Well, thanks for taking the call. If you could just comment on the revised 7% to 9% distribution growth for next year and how that dovetails into the eventual 1.1 coverage target? When should we be expect to see coverage actually moved significantly north of 1 million barrels?
Unidentified Company Representative: There were two parts for the questions. The first part was how we would comment on the 7% to 9% distribution growth guidance. We believe that that is a reasonable range. Our guidance will usually hit 2% wide I expect to be within the 7% to 9%. How does that dovetails into our coverage, we expected that the improving coverage across 2014 and we’re ultimately headed towards that target about a 1.1 million barrels to 1.6 million. The back end of 2014 for example will have better coverage than the front end.
James Jampel – HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC: Would 2015 be run at 1.1 coverage in total in your anticipation?
Unidentified Company Representative: Well when we look at the coverage, the 1.1 to 1.2 long-term Targa covered does not necessarily any one-year, but if you look at 2014, there is about $900 million worth of projects coming on line in 2014, but we’re spending the capital be up in the door, but we won’t full credit for all the EBITDA. So we’ll still have continued growth and continued CapEx and our planned outlook for years. We don’t have as much visibility and don’t get into 2015, 2016 guidance. But as we look through three years, four years, five years and a forecast we look when the capital has turned out the door when the EBITDA is up and kind of about 1.1 times to 1.2 times out multiple years.
James Jampel – HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Maresca from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Company Representative: Hi Stephen, good morning. I’m on the phone line. You can listen to this. Hello.
Operator: Stephen. It looks like he has disconnected. (Operator Instructions)
Stephen Maresca – Morgan Stanley: Hello.
Unidentified Company Representative: Hello, Stephen. Are you there?
Stephen Maresca – Morgan Stanley: Can you hear me?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah.
Stephen Maresca - Morgan Stanley: I do not know why the shit I disconnected, sorry about that. Badland, the additional gas processing plan, can you talk a little bit about what the ballpark type of CapEx that could be for 2014, is that what happened? I don’t know if you can mention that.
Unidentified Company Representative: What I mentioned is we haven’t yet decided the size that is necessary and that will impact the call
Stephen Maresca – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Just on the M&A front, you haven’t done anything major since badlands in 2012, is that just a sign of where we are in the M&A cycle in terms of the expensiveness of the assets, do you see that dynamic changing or you just feel that organically you’ve got enough on your plate right now?
Unidentified Company Representative: We’re still looking, but we do have a lot on our plate and we don’t need an acquisition today anymore than we did when we did our last acquisition, don’t expect us to be doing a major acquisition in the near future. The market that is always a funny market, sometimes people are paying too much for assets, sometimes people hang around the net and get a better deal.
Stephen Maresca – Morgan Stanley: Okay. On the export side, obviously volumes are up a lot and you’re seeing some of the differential between the U.S. and international pricing come down a bit. I mean, how do you think that changes your abilities for another expansion project going forward or the types of returns that you’ve been able to receive there. I mean, how deep is this market for the next couple of years do you believe?
Unidentified Company Representative: I think, I’ll answer the short one instead of taking the microphone back to the people who have been working on that, but I know from them that interest, negotiations are still very robust across some range of types of players. So, there is a lot of demand being expressed for our export capabilities. We’ve contracted fully for the first phase and we’ve got a nice return second phase already underway and that will be adding to our capability across 2014. Once that’s in place, we do have attractive returns, expansion would be bottlenecking, capacity additions on the market, we’re not announcing any of that. I think the market is deep enough for the best players.
Stephen Maresca – Morgan Stanley: Okay. That’s all for me, thanks a lot.
Unidentified Company Representative: You need to look out and see where Scott is sitting. Did I miss something? He said it was fine, he’ll correct me later. We got one from...
Operator: And there…
Unidentified Company Representative: Go ahead, what you got?
Unidentified Analyst: [indiscernible]
Unidentified Company Representative: Your microphone ball is not that good. I actually would not expect any of, many of those major projects to contribute in EBITDA in 2014 with the exception of the Badlands gas plant which we mentioned, so our projects that we’re spending money on that aren’t on the list of the 590 to 600 that will contribute EBITDA in 2014, I would say that we are at the $590 million of projected approved projects and that will add to that across the year. Is that okay. I didn’t repeat the question I’m so sorry the question was about the backlog and what percentage of the backlog might be spent in 2014 and what percentage of the backlog might be contributing to EBITDA in 2014 and so now you have the context for my answer, I apologize for those on the phone.
Unidentified Analyst: And a quick follow up on the backlog, you’ve mentioned that the condensate splitter has the potential add on to your export footprint, now that we’re starting to see some of the crude pricing on the Gulf of Coast back off, global prices maybe signaling that there is a bit of bottleneck around the Gulf Coast. Have that accelerated the amount of demand for that condensate splitting for other project and just a bit of the final one for me would be do you think we’d see ethane export as part of this LPG export boom and if we do just Targa participate in those ethane export projects?
Unidentified Company Representative: Okay, taking the pieces of that. First there was additional interest or not on the condensate splitter projects that we’re working on and that separate and apart from LPGs. But I’ll look out in the room and I will just ask say Vince Di Cosimo to give me an up, down or even.
Vincent Di Cosimo: You said there’s more interest on condensate splitter that we’re talking about and that’s about as much I would want to say about. And you said ethane exports is going to be up a part of the LPG export boom, I think ethane exports are profitable and there is certainly one already there from the east coast facilities like ours could be a part of that. Those projects will have to have backing and the commitment of whatever counterparties who are that one ethane exports that spent a lot more dollars on the other side of the water that need to be spent on this side of the water, so it’s say its probably good capital. Did I missed anything in the question, okay great.
Unidentified Analyst: Could you comment on what type of activity you’re seeing in the Gulf of Mexico? And what that could being for target in future years?
Vincent Di Cosimo: Some of the people in this room know that I really like to talk about the Gulf of Mexico but I didn’t pay him to say that and I am not trying to hide the Gulf of Mexico. We’ve just got such a great set of assets across the Gulf of Mexico, the best characters that I believe for near shore Louisiana and offshore Louisiana. And we keep figuring out how to get more liquids and make more money would vest in with volumes. And I think we benefit from the consolidation that’s going on. I’m hopeful of renewed activity and renewed production particularly oil rich liquids oriented which is whether it will be. But I don’t see that in 2014, the research projects and the E&P work that you can read publicly also and I know from my petroleum engineering friends of my age and class that could lead to some thing. And that would be very attractive for our – for that small portion of our business. To give you an idea, we didn’t bring someone from the coastal segment to answer Q&A, but there is no one in the back of the rook shaking their head, nodding their head at.
Unidentified Analyst: I would appreciate.
Unidentified Company Representative: Well, Mike did. Mike remains me of Mars be which is dedicated to Venice it is coming on and the shale has been committed to it and there hasn’t really been any slip in their schedule. That is certainly meaningful for the coastal segments and we see lots of other projects. We are working with those customers, I’m just not trying to oversell the 14, 15, 16 essential for that. But I think you’ll see it continue to help that segment, which is very good in making money.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, can you talk a little bit just your approach, how you see the long-term demand story playing out, for liquids and you highlighted what’s going on up in the Bakken, and what’s going on in the Permian and now you mentioned the potential longer-term potential growth for the catchers mid in the Gulf region. And all I see is supply, supply, supply, supply. We know there is crackers come on board, but are we getting to the point where we aren’t be in a perpetual over supply situation. How do you see the demand catching up to the supply I know we are going to run out of runway?
Unidentified Company Representative: That’s a risk question and we’ve probably spend six slides talking about it, but I’ll give you my summery review and then we can talk about it more later. The supply side of equations in this country has driven by the drill build, 80% dominated by drilling on oil right now. And on the global scale, that supply increases in the United States are not changing the macro supply and demand. So we are going to in my opinion exist in the world of pricing, the balance of supply demands for world oil that continues to cause the drill test to be as active in this country as it has been in this country. And just got to take you out to the innovativeness of U.S. E&P to continue to find and improve the productivity of horizontal oil wells. So I believe that continues. On the other side of the equation, the gas well inventories at pretty low prices becomes economic in my interpretation of what we saw in 2013 was even some spike in Haynesville drilling, dry gas drilling occurs when gas prices got a little bit up. So I suspect the natural gas supply demand will stay in balance, I don’t know exactly where and if that balance has been assisted by conversion to gas and then gas exports and price will be the valve that turns on how many dry or gas wells get drilled relative to their economics. Than you got it stuck in between and that comes with and that’s NGL that comes from natural gas wells and that comes from big gas from oil wells, those NGLs come, we could try to show the forecast of what’s happening and in the macrosense exports balance that also on the global scale where we’ve got long life, low cost or relatively low cost NGLs on the world scale. First ethane that becomes ethylene takes a few years to get that build, but it’s globally advances except for a few Middle East countries and if you are building a new pit camp to keep up with global demands, you might rather build this here than in the Middle East. So that’s taking care of exports at ethane and maybe you get the question all the time, maybe you export ethane not as ethylene that could occur. Than all of the other LPGs, so it’s not the content to get export it as well from gasoline to butanes and propane as a price clearing mechanisms. And that’s working and when it doesn’t work, prices will go down and then it’ll adjust. I’m not trying to predict prices I’m just trying to show this as multiple needs. Our company is pretty well positioned to do okay through this – sometimes over supplies, sometimes over supplied, sometimes exported then one catches up, as far as I can say.
Unidentified Company Representative: So is that a reasonable short answer, I’m happy for any of team to give the better one because I often forget things.
Unidentified Analyst: So seems it long-term you see it in balance?
Unidentified Company Representative: In balance, but always being a little bit long and then a little bit short and then having something compensate, there is only brief moments when it’s in balance. But not exports balance.
Unidentified Analyst: But there is no future, you are not afraid of any future tipping points of the permanent in balancing supply demand?
Unidentified Company Representative: All right, I think there is a tipping point on ethane thing right now. We are tipping up to a lot of rejection which is compensating and handling this until the pet chems get built. And the same sort of things might happen in another LPG in there, just some one was talking about the condensate in oil, those are little tipping point that cause something to happen. But I think it works.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Unidentified Company Representative: And it works because we are low cost relative to most of the rest of the world supply and that’s important.
Unidentified Analyst: If I may just turn a little bit somewhere in the same regard, I’d allow the chart that you draw up here with a lot of separate triangles about the active rigs around the different systems. I’m just curious a little bit, how much of those – how is it all play out, I mean are those rigs where they are operating for the operators, have they already dedicated acreage of the volumes that you know, what’s common to you and what’s not common to you. Are those operation still jump walls where you can allow five of those volumes, you’ve shown all those rigs, clearly some are right overlapping the pipes and some are two, three inches away from where the current systems are, but are on the map. So I’m just trying to get it right and how that plays in?
Unidentified Company Representative: You are right, we sell all of those to give you a macro view of the activity and if we actually went to on the people running into those area not on that scale of markets, circles the ones that are already dedicated and the ones that they competed for and maybe lost or compete for and one. If you trying to draw a circle around our system, the more you are in the centre of our system that more you can be pretty sure of it, that we didn’t even have to compete for. Further out from our system, the more might have been a competitor and might have been in the middle of their joining system and we have some system overlaps. So I’m not trying to say, please no one interrupt that we’re saying we get everyone of those, little triangle. But in our areas we can compete pretty going well, because when we say yes to our customer we take all the gas, we don’t have rolling brownouts and we have a pretty good reputation, if you hear anything about our reputation we maybe a hard negotiators, but we get the job done. Okay, thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: [Inaudible Question]
Unidentified Company Representative: And with that, you are wrong when you talked about that’s going outside. With that we are as the producers come in this entire uses and good example. If you look back four years ago, they were drilling operator well. They were all vertical wells, we were connecting 300 to 350 wells, this is going to be less wells connected, that they are definitely will get a huge step for the number of horizontal rigs that we are seeing. It has higher IPs and I think that those dedication are fairly long-term and they are large areas, that chunk that came in at 10,000 and 20,000 to 30,000 acres.
Unidentified Company Representative: For the people we didn’t hear when Mike picked up the phone, repeating just a piece of it for the people on the phone across our systems. It should not sound like, we’ve got a lot of jump balls going on within our system sort of system footprint, we’ve got lots and lots of dedication. That’s how we do business. That’s how the business is done and those dedications have been increased over the last several years.
Unidentified Analyst: Joe Bob, couple of quick questions as it relates to everything that you just laid out around liquids export, I’m curious over the next 18 months to 24 months. How do you see the development of the Patriot Terminal and Channelview, obviously Channelview more suited to doing if you will find product exports, and obviously there is a big opportunity t there, may be ultimately that’s were the splitter goes and it become so light after gas or oil export facility. Patriot is a little bit different, it can do those capabilities as well as propane, butane. So across the opportunities that if you could just rank it in terms of returns, how do those two terminals look in two years? 
Joe Bob Perkins: You sort of asked the question and then probably he gave a pretty good answer to it. Those are nice add-ons to our petroleum logistics, the Patriot dock has the potential down the road after other expansions of a 50% [Ph] of LPG exports. Our terminally work will be around whatever contract that is the most profitable maybe exports, maybe just been movement. But I really don’t want to say more than that relative to negotiations that are going on for those terminals. When the projects are up in running or do you see increases from talk about it.
Unidentified Analyst: Joe, I know the answer is great, but that’s all I want to know.
Joe Bob Perkins: Let me add one thing about Patriot in particular, if you take a helicopter and you fly out into the Gulf of Mexico and then look at the mouth of Calis Bay and you see all the ships that are queued up there. Oil imports refined products, imports and exports that emerged on those ships are huge, the average weight is similar between 9 and 10 days out there for those ships to get into the port. That creates huge demand for utilization of large ship dock and we’ve got Patriot and we are working in our second Phase of the LPG export. We are building dock 4, it’s under construction and we’ve done engineering to build another dock. So that we can on the other side of our existing larger ship dock. So there is lots of demand out there, we are talking to a large number of companies that see the opportunities with all the pipeline our plump through that area plumbed through that area of Mont Belvieu to do all types of exchanges and exports.
Unidentified Analyst: A couple of years ago, I may have time a little bit, but a couple of years ago you guys assembled a team of people that where going to working on tunnel acquisitions doing M&A in terminal space. It was fairly consistent for your activity through 2011, into 2012 in terms of tunnel acquisitions it’s been very quite since. What happened to that team and what’s your strategy in that business? 
Joe Bob Perkins:
 :  So there is another project that’s out there, that’s the public because we have permits and options around it and that is stock-based and the team is certainly working on other things that would say and there is another little thumbprint that we’re turning into multi-fingerprint, and we are still interested in doing that. What some people have asked us about always do we look at the great big acquisitions like the health acquisitions. We don’t look at that one very long, but we would have been interested in pieces of parts. Vince, do you have anything you want to add to that?

Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Vincent Di Cosimo: Still active and still making those more profitable.
Unidentified Analyst: Patriot is part of that group.
Vincent Di Cosimo: Yep. So there was one other little acquisition there and just assets like that.
Unidentified Analyst: I have a question on the regions. You’re working on now. You’ve had a pretty toward pace of growth in the gathering side. I’m curious as to, is there a point where you see the demand – the activity having on your fields where you are gathering the gas. I’m just staying, when the build out – is there a point when the build out is close to an end of the beginning?
Vincent Di Cosimo: I need to take that by parts. Certainly, the Permian Basin, as far as, my rate our step goes, I don’t see the activity having there and around our assets being very well positioned across that Permian basin. North Texas, I think, I said in the past, I should have that activity in North Texas has decreased, the growth of it has decreased somewhat. We’re still growing volumes and that’s because resources have shifted to the Permian Basin pure oil versus very wet gas now. As an example, the Marble Falls is an oil play for smaller guy who have a position there and don’t have the position in the Permian Basin that’s very attractive economics. In the Bakken, I don’t want to see need for gathering slowing down there at all, we are slower. And for example, we talked about the later potential of our customer segments, there are just very few wells going on in Southwest Louisiana or on the offshore for immediate connections compared to other periods of time and that could improve versus getting slower. So that’s my kind of broad what does it look like. No more questions here, we don’t have anymore on the phone coming up. I’m actually going to say bye to the operator. Thanks operator. Anybody online who are sort of waiting for a question and didn’t get it in feel free to give us a call Matt, Jennifer or any other rest of the team and we’ll try to help you later. Okay. We’re going to still…
Joe Bob Perkins:  Yes.
Vincent Di Cosimo:  Hang on a second are we cut off?
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2013 Q2  (2013-08-02 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Jennifer Kneale - Director - Finance Joe Bob Perkins - Chief Executive Officer Matt Meloy - SVP, CFO and Treasurer
Analysts: Edward Rowe - Raymond James
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Targa Resources second quarter 2013 earnings webcast and presentation. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, this call maybe recorded. I'd now introduce your host for today's conference Jennifer (inaudible) Director of Finance, you may begin, sir.
Jennifer Kneale: Thank you, operator. I'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2013 investor call for both Targa Resources Corp. and Targa Resources Partners LP. Before we get started, I would like to mention that Targa Resources Corp., TRC, or the Company and Targa Resources Partners LP, Targa Resources Partners or the Partnership have published their joint earnings release which is available on our website www.taragaresources.com. We will also be posting an updated investor presentation to the website later today. Speaking on the call today will be Joe Bob Perkins, Chief Executive Officer, and Matt Meloy, Chief Financial Officer. Other management team members are available for the Q&A. Joe Bob and Matt are going to be comparing the second quarter 2013 results to prior period results, as well as providing additional color on our results, business performance, and other matters of interest. I would like to remind you that any statements made during this call that might include the company's or the Partnership's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Please note that actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings, including the Partnership's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. With that, I will turn it over to Joe Bob Perkins.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Jen. Welcome and thanks to everyone for participating. For today's call, I'll start off with a high level review of performance highlights. We'll then turn it over to Matt to review the Partnership's consolidated financial results, it's segment results and other financial matters for the partnership. Matt will also review key financial matters related to Targa Resources Corp. Following, Matt's comments, I'll provide some concluding remarks and then we'll take your questions. Our reported second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $127 million as compared to $123 million last year. This was 3% increase compared to second quarter last year driven by volume increases across all our Field Gathering & Processing system and by increased margin in our Logistics and Marketing division. Our overall results show the benefits of diversity and increasing fee based margin contributions. Fee based margins were greater than 50% for the second straight quarter. For the Field Gathering & Processing segment, the combination of volume increases and higher natural gas and condensate prices more than offset the NGL prices that were 20% lower in the second quarter of 2013 versus the second quarter of 2012. The logistics asset segment produced quarterly operating margin of $52 million, up 14% compared to last year, primarily driven by higher fractionation revenue of CBF, and increased LPG, export and storage activity and our integrated Galena Park and Mont Belvieu facilities. The strong results for the Logistics Assets segment were just achieved despite a planned partial turnaround at CBF that resulted in lower fractionation throughput. In addition to the work done during the turnaround to comply with OSHA requirements, we're completing some additional work that will increase operational efficiency at CBF. We're pleased to announce that CBF Train 4 is operational, we are also pleased to announce that we have finally broken ground on our $200 million a day Longhorn plant to North Texas. We received our greenhouse gas permit in mid-June, but it was subject to an additional 30-day public notice period related some necessary changes to the permit requested by Targa. That period was over in mid-July and we were able to break ground. As you may recall, we ordered the plant some time ago and we have done all that we can to be able to construct as quickly as possible. We now believe that the plant will commence startup activities just shortly after the first of the year. In the Permian Basin, our 30 million a day expansion at SAOU is completed in the first quarter and we are already close to full. The new 200 million a day High Plains plant at SAOU announced in the fourth quarter of 2012 is still on track to be finished in mid 2014. The producers need for this plant is even greater than when we announced it. The producer activity in this portion of the Permian Basin is very high and the activity around all our other Permian Basin systems continues to increase. This is the second quarter that we are including results from Targa Badlands, our Bakken Shale crude oil and gas gathering operation. We saw the quarter over first quarter increase in crude gathered and continued to make progress on multiple fronts of this growth project. Similarly, we're making progress on every growth projects across the company, so back to our overall results and outlook. Distributable cash flow for the quarter of approximately $79 million resulted in distribution coverage of approximately 0.8 times, based on our second quarter declared distribution of $0.715 are $2.86 on an annual basis. Second quarter distribution coverage is expected to be the low point for the year. With third quarter distribution coverage expected to increase and to continue to improve in Q4 as you probably recall this coverage profile I just described is consistent with our previous guidance for distribution coverage which we expressed as about 1 point over the year but lower in the first half of 2013. We expect significant coverage improvement over the remainder of this year driven by highly visible improvements from the following factors. Increasing inlet volumes in our Field Gathering & Processing segment, increasing NGL volumes from our coastal gathering and processing segment and from the highly visible increasing margin contributions from our capital growth projects that are beginning, CBF Train 4 and the International Export Project, which are about on time or early. Of course a sustained decrease in NGL prices below current levels could reduce our coverage below our expectation for 2013 but not materially. Similarly, sustained increases in NGL prices above current levels could improve our coverage but not materially. The Partnership's second quarter distribution of $0.7150 or $2.86 annualized represents an the 11% increase compared to the second quarter of 2012. At the TRC level, the second quarter dividend of $0.5325 or $2.13 annualized represents a 35% increased compared to the second quarter of 2012. Given Q2 performance we are comfortable with our previous EBITDA guidance and comfortable that we will deliver on our distribution and dividend goals for 2013. That wraps up my initial comments and I'll hand it over to Matt.
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Joe Bob. I'd like to add my welcome and thank you for joining our call today. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $127 million, compared to $123 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily the result of increased volumes in our Field Gathering & Processing segment and higher LPG export activity in our Logistics and Marketing division, partially offset by lower NGL prices. Overall operating margin increased 2% for the second quarter compared to the second quarter of last year. I will review the drivers of this performance in our segment review. Gross maintenance capital expenditures were $21.8 million in the second quarter of 2013, compared to $15.5 million for the same period last year. Net maintenance capital expenditures were $19.4 million in the second quarter of 2013 compared to $13 million in the second quarter of '12. The increase in maintenance CapEx was consistent with increased activity, higher volumes and higher capacity utilizations across our businesses. As a result, we now expect net maintenance CapEx for 2013 to be $85 million versus previous guidance of $75 million. Turning to the segment level, I'll summarize the second quarter performance on a year-over-year basis. We'll start with the Gathering & Processing segments. Field Gathering & Processing operating margin increased by 25% compared to last year, driven by higher natural gas inlet volumes and NGL production. Higher natural gas and condensate prices and increasing margin contribution from Badlands. These increases were partially offset by lower NGL prices and higher offering expenses due to additional compression and maintenance cost associated with system expansion and the addition of Badlands. Second quarter 2013 natural gas inlet volumes for the field gathering and processing segment was 793 million cubic feet per day, a 19% increase compared to the same period in 2012. The overall increase in natural gas inland volumes was due to increases experienced in each business unit. 27% at SAOU, 24% at Sand Hills, 20% in North Texas and 1% in Versado, plus the addition of Badlands. For the segment, NGL prices decreased 20% while natural gas prices increased by 93% and condensate prices increased by 5% compared to the second quarter of 2012. Turning now to the coastal gathering and processing segment, operating margin decreased 40% in the second quarter compared to last year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower commodity prices and less favorable frac spreads. Inland volumes increased 48% at LOU driven by the addition of Big Lake plant and 12% in VESCO but were lower at our Coastal Straddles plant as a result of the impact of the Yscloskey and Calumet plants shutdowns and operational issues. We continue to add to the recapture volumes and previously went to Yscloskey in our more efficient cryogenic VESCO plant. We would have seen a larger overall segment increase in volumes but where impacted by third-party producer and type operational issues. Since quarter end those operational issues have been largely resolved and volumes have been increasing. For the segment, NGL prices decreased 15% while natural gas prices increased by 80% and condensate prices increased by 12% compared to the second quarter of 2012. Next, I'll provide an overview of the two downstream segments, starting with the logistics assets segment as Joe Bob mentioned in the opening second quarter operating margin increased 14% compared to the second quarter of 2012, driven by LGP export activity and higher fractionation fees despite fractionation volumes declining as a result of the previously mentioned planned maintenance turnaround at CBF. The effect of lower fractionation volumes will be partially recovered in the third and fourth quarters as inventories processed. We continue to see increasing levels of export activity across our Galena Park marine terminal on the Houston Ship Channel. We loaded over 1.2 million barrels per month of LPG for export in the second quarter, a 46% increase over the second quarter of 2012. Export activity continues to exceed our expectation as we improved our ability to load ships even with the ongoing construction at Galena Park that resulted in a slight reduction in sequential quarter-over-quarter volumes. In the marketing and distribution segment, operating margin for the segment increased 5% over the second quarter of 2012 due primarily to higher LPG export activity and increased truck and barge transportation opportunities. These positives were partially offset by decreased NGL prices. With that, lets now briefly to capital structure and liquidity. As of June 30, we had $225 million of outstanding borrowings under the partnership $1.2 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due 2017. Without sending letters of credit; a $48 million revolver availability was about $927 million at quarter end. Total liquidity including approximately $73 million of cash on hand was about $1 billion. At quarter end, we had borrowings of $125 million under our accounts receivable securitization facility. As of the end of July, we had $114 million borrowed under this facility. On May 9, we announced that we priced a successful $625 million offering, a 4.25 senior unsecured notes due November 2023. A portion of the proceeds were used to pay down our revolving credit facility to redeem our 11.25 notes and for other general partnership purposes. In the second quarter, we received gross proceeds of approximately $157 million from equity issuances under our aftermarket equity program which allows us to periodically sell equity at prevailing market prices. Year-to-date, we have now raised approximately $265 million of gross proceeds under this program. Given the success in this program so far this year, we believe that it could be possible to use the ATM to meet our equity needs over the remainder year, while the other options are available to access additional liquidity, one of the benefits of the ATM program is that it allows us to match the timings of our equity issuances more closely to our capital spending profile. To accommodate additional units that could be offered through our ATM program, on July 29, we filed amended universal shelf registration statement that allows us to issue an additional $800 million of debt or equity securities. Total funded debt on June 30 was approximately $2.65 billion or about 57% of total capitalization and our second quarter compliance debt-to-EBITDA ratio which provide adjusted EBITDA credit from interior road projects are in process but not yet complete, in which include other adjustments was 4.1 times. Next, I would like to make a few comments about our fee based margin, hedging and capital spending programs for the year. Prior to the start of the year, we provided guidance that we expected over 50% of our operating margin to be fee based by the end of '13 and both Q1 and Q2 operating margin was over 50% fee based and we expect this to increase in Q3 and Q4. We continue to expect operating margin reach 55% to 65% during 2014 driven by a fee based expansions including fractionation, LPG exports and crude gathering. During the second quarter, we added some additional hedges for natural gas for the non-fee based operating margins relative to the partnerships current equity volumes from field gathering and processing, we estimate we've currently hedged approximately 69% of remaining 2013 natural gas and 50% of remaining 2013 combined NGL and gathering segment. We continue to be less hedged than in previous years primarily on ethane and propane but our diversity and increasing fee-based improvements reduce the need to hedge commodity prices to previous percentages across all commodities. Moving on to capital spending, we estimate approximately $1 billion of growth capital expenditures in 2013 and expect maintenance CapEx net to our interest to be approximately $85 million. Next, I will make a few brief remarks about the results of Targa Resources Corp. Targa Resources Corp standalone distributable cash flow for the second quarter of 2013 was approximately $30 million and TRC declared $22 million in dividends for the quarter. On July 16, TRC declared the second quarter cash dividend of $0.5325 per common share or $2.13 per common share on an annualized basis representing an approximately 35% increase over the annualized rate pay with respect to the second quarter of 2012. As of June 30, TRC had $78 million in borrowings outstanding under its $150 million senior secured credit facility and $10 million in cash resulting in total liquidity of approximately $82 million. That concludes my review. So now I will turn the call back over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob: Thank you, Matt. To wrap up the final portion of our prepared remarks, let's start with a brief update on the status to some of the $1.7 billion of major growth projects coming online in the second half of 2013 and in 2014. As mentioned earlier in the call, our 100,000 barrel per day CBF Train 4 expansion is operational. Consistent with an estimated timing included in our 2013 fiscal year guidance given last year, we expect CBF Train 4 to contribute to third quarter operating margin and to be fully contributing to operating margin sometime during the fourth quarter of 2013. As briefly discussed in our last earnings call and it's now reported in the industry, our expanded international export project will likely be completed prior to our term contracts beginning in October, which may allow us to service additional cargos in September. We affirm take or pay contracts to load 4 VLGCs per month beginning in October, when the expansion will allow us to load total propane and or butane in excess of 3 million barrels per month. We expect to bring the facility up in September, ramping up during September to that October rate. We also expect to continue to increase our export loading capability. So that we can load in excess of 5 million total barrels per month sometime during the third quarter of 2014, when the second phase of our export project comes online. We continue to see strong demand for capacity reservations under multi-year take or pay contracts. In North Dakota there is a lot of hard work going on as we integrate and grow the footprint of the Badlands asset. Quarter over first quarter our average daily crude throughput increase by 21% driven by producer activity, volumes are now beginning to ramp. And through the rest of 2013, we expect to at least continue with this rate of sequential quarter-over-quarter volume growth. We are adding growth related infrastructure projects that will capture existing producer volumes in the Badlands that are currently being trucked out, that work will capture new near term dedicated volumes and that work will position the system to access dedicated volumes related to future producer drilling plans. Through the rest of 2013 and 2014, we expect to almost double the miles of pipeline on our system, doubling just to serve expected drilling on our existed dedicated acreage. We expected the combination of volume growth from producer activity in the ongoing construction and in our areas of dedication will result in significant increase in both crude and natural gas volumes by year end 2013. We continue to expect the Badlands acquisition to be accretive during 2014. So in conclusion, as you can tell from our overall comments today Q2 was an important quarter for Targa. We continue to execute according to plan on our major growth projects coming on line and on our ongoing business performing well, even with lower NGL prices. We have said that 2013 is a transitional year for Targa. With our business performing very well and the timing of some of the projects coming on, we believe that you will look back and see the second quarter as clearly an inflexion point or an inflexion quarter for transitional year. We are looking forward to having some of our highly visible growth projects starting to contribute to margin in the third quarter and believe that the scale and diversity of our business and those growth projects will support continued distribution growth in 2013, 2014 and beyond. The solid performance in Q2 underpins our comfort with our guidance on volumes, EBITDA and distribution and dividend growth. So with that, we will open it up to questions. I'll turn it back to you operator.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Edward Rowe of Raymond James.
Edward Rowe - Raymond James: With crude spread tightening and backward dated market, how are you guys, how is really customer reaction around the [Sand Hills] asset base, has that changed or compared to what your views were almost six months ago?
Joe Bob Perkins: The change in spreads has not slowed down overall producer activity in our area at all. We have seen some switching month to month of where our producer would prefer for their barrels to be getting off of our system. We expect that to continue. That's why we're trying to provide the multiple outlets off of the system. That's really the short answer.
Edward Rowe - Raymond James: Given that we're seeing approximately 30% to 35% of natural gas being flared in the Bakken, do you guys see some incremental opportunities within the midstream space to really capture some of these constraints?
Joe Bob Perkins: Gas gathering in processing is very much a part of our strategy in the Bakken. We got a lot of work to do. We've been reengineering the existing plant. The third plant is going to be coming on in (inaudible) the second Train is coming on in the third quarter and other third Train in the second quarter. That's way too much talking. Just coming on now, we are working with operators, producers to improve how their system is bringing gas to our gathering system. We've reengineered the plant to better handle too many liquids coming in to the gas and we are going to be improving that over time, we like the upside, and we are trying to help out with the flaring situation.
Edward Rowe - Raymond James:  Couple more questions. Given the expectations that the Gulf Coast you get really saturated with condensate, although we are not really seeing that in prices, could this really open a door for may be refine product exports at your facility and may be condensate splitting capabilities?
Joe Bob Perkins:  The industry knows that we are looking at condensate splitting projects. And as far as exports are in Galena Park export facility is pretty much committed on what we handle through it right now. We do handle refine products and we are looking at refine products through the Patriot dock not necessarily for export.
Edward Rowe - Raymond James: And last and final question, there has been some chatter around the TMS and Cotton Valley, and I know the Coastal G&P segment is a little start of that, but are you guys seeing some extensions north with your facilities that capture some of these volumes?
Joe Bob Perkins: I am bullish so it's not in our guidance or forecast about the positioning about Coastal Straddles operations. You mentioned the TMS, we've told people we've been benefitting with the [real cost]. We've had discussions with probably most of the producers working on the TMS. We've got existing facilities that can potentially serve that should they have significant gas processing needs. I also think that the position in the Coastal Straddles prospects over the next three years will benefit from increased activity in the Gulf of Mexico.
Operator: Our next question is from [Matthew Phillip with Clarkston].
Unidentified Analyst: We see a nice little bump in the propane prices the past month or so, during July $0.20 or so backup in the 90s on a down basis. If this sustains itself we can see average NGL barrel maybe back in the 80s, how do you see that in backing up your coverage guidance for the remainder of the year?
Joe Bob Perkins: We were trying to be clear on how we felt about our overall guidance at current price levels. Our current price levels are in the below 80s right now for our barrel. And prices will go up and down in around current price levels in our opinion for the remainder of the year. We feel good about our guidance at current price levels. I think I even said that if prices were to go down and stay down below current price levels, we might be a little bit lower than our expectations for 2013 but not materially. And if prices go up from current levels and stay up from current levels, we might be a little bit above but not materially.
Unidentified Analyst: On Galena Park, what's your rough breakdown on propane versus butane exports? As butane exports are pretty seasonal counter the blending season and do you expect the expansion be aligned to may be capture some butane products before blending season kicks in?
Joe Bob Perkins: If you look back historically, our performance on propane versus butane has range from 20% to 30% butane. Prospectively, the large deals GC contracts that we have, have rights to take percentages of butane that would be represented above. And in terms of before the blending season, water born butane isn't as seasonal as U.S. butane is and there wasn't a seasonal a percentage difference over the last year historically.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any further remarks.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you, operator. To the extent, anyone has follow-up questions, please feel free to give us a call, you can call me, Jim, Matt, any of the rest of us. Thank you again for your time today and we look forward to speaking with you in the future.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Targa Resources First Quarter 2013 Earnings Webcast and Presentation. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference call, Mr. Chris McEwan. You may begin, sir.
Chris McEwan: Thank you, Operator. I’d like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2013 investor call for both Targa Resources Corp. and Targa Resources Partners LP. Before we get started, I would like to mention that Targa Resources Corp., TRC, or the Company and Targa Resources Partners LP, Targa Resources Partners or the Partnership have published their joint earnings release which is available on our website www.taragaresources.com. We will also be posting an updated investor presentation to the website after the call. Speaking on the call today will be Joe Bob Perkins, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Meloy, Chief Financial Officer. Other management team members are available for the Q&A. Joe Bob and Matt are going to be comparing the first quarter 2013 results to prior period results, as well as providing additional color on our results, business performance, and other matters of interest. I would like to remind you that any statements made during this call might include the Company’s or the Partnership’s expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Please note that actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings, including the Company’s and the Partnership’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. With that, I’ll turn it over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Chris. Good morning and thanks to everyone for participating. For today's call I’ll start off with high level review performance highlights. We’ll then turn it over to Matt to review the Partnerships consolidated financial results, its segment results and other financial matters for the Partnership. Matt will also review key financial matters related Targa Resources Corp. Following Matt’s comments, I'll provide some concluding remarks and then we'll get to questions-and-answers. Our reported first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $132 million, as compared to $145 million first quarter of last year, this was a 9% decrease in EBITDA compared to the first quarter last year. However, given the backdrop of approximately 30% lower NGL prices compared to the first quarter of 2013 versus 2012, the results show the long-term benefits of increasing fee-based margin contribution to our mix, the benefits of growth in our Field G&P and the growth in the export volume. I should also point out that the first quarter NGL prices were just slightly lower than those assumed in our 2013 guidance. So the first quarter results are tracking our full year outlook just slight. The fee-based Logistics Assets segment produced record quarterly operating margin of $56 million, up 31% compared to last year, primarily driven by higher fees for services across the segment, higher LSNG and benzene treating volume and increased LPG export activity which benefits both the Logistics Assets and Marketing and Distribution segments. The strong results for Logistics Assets segment were achieved despite somewhat lower fractionation volumes caused by third-party ethane rejection and third-party pipeline curtailments. Those somewhat lower volumes were partially mitigated by fracker pay minimum volume commitments. Marketing and Distribution increased compared to the first quarter of 2012, driven by the higher LPG export activity that I just mentioned, and by higher wholesale propane margins, that resulted both from colder winter this year and from logistics-related opportunities. Continued strong producer activity in the Field Gathering and Processing segment led to increased volumes compared to the first quarter of 2012. This is also the first quarter that we are including results from Targa Badlands, our Bakken Shale crude oil and gas gathering operation. This business which is really a growth project and process as reported in our Field Gathering and Processing segment. Badlands generates predominantly fee-based margin and is one of the key contributors to our multiyear forecasted increase in fee-based margin. I’ll give you some more color on Badlands later in the call. Distributable cash flow for the quarter of approximately $86 million resulted in distribution coverage of approximately 0.9 times, based on our first quarter declared distribution of $69.75 or $2.79 on an annual basis. Second quarter distribution coverage could be similar to or potentially somewhat lower than the first quarter due to historic seasonality in the downstream business. This coverage profile is consistent with the guidance we gave on the fourth quarter earnings call for distribution coverage to be approximately 0.9 times in the first half of ’13, given the impact of the highly visible high capital growth projects and the Badlands acquisition. CBF Train 4 and the international export project will start contributing significant margin in the back half of the year along with Badlands. Consistent with previous guidance, we continue to expect 2013 coverage to average about 1.0 for the full year and overtime expect coverage to return to our long-term target of 1.2 times. The Partnerships first quarter distribution of $69.75 or $2.79 annualized represents a 12% increase compared to the first quarter of 2012. But the TRC level the first quarter dividend of $49.5 or $1.98 annualized represents a 36% increase compared to last year. Given Q1 performance, we are comfortable with our EBITDA guidance and comfortable that we will deliver on our distribution and dividend goals for 2013. That wraps up my initial comments and I’ll hand it over to Matt.
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Joe Bob. I’d like to add my welcome and thank you for joining our call today. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter $132 million, compared to $145 million for the same period last year. The decrease was primarily the result of lower operating margin at our Gathering and Processing division, driven primarily by lower NGL and condensate prices, partially offset by 31% increase in our Logistics and Marketing division due primarily to higher LPG export activity. Higher fractionation fee and increased wholesale propane margins. Overall operating margin decreased 8% for the first quarter compared to last year. I will review the drivers of this performance in our segment review. Gross maintenance capital expenditures were $21.7 million in the first quarter of 2013, compared to $16.5 million in 2012, adjusting for the non-controlling interest portion of maintenance capital expenditures and certain reimbursements from TRC to the Partnership, net maintenance capital expenditures were $18.8 million in the first quarter of 2013, compared to $143 million in 2012. Turning to the segment level, I’ll summarize the first quarter performance on a year-over-year basis. We’ll start with our Gathering and Processing segments. Field Gathering and Processing operating margin decreased by 26% compared to last year, driven by lower NGL and condensate prices and higher operating expenses due to additional compression and maintenance cost associated with system expansion and the addition of Badlands. These effects were partially offset by increased natural gas plant inlet volumes, higher natural gas prices and margin contribution from Badlands. Please note that these segment results do not include the mitigating impact of our hedging program even though the hedging program is primarily associated with this segment. First quarter 2013 natural gas plant inlet for the Field Gathering and Processing segments was 729 million cubic feet per day, an 11% increase compared to the same period in 2012. The addition of natural gas inlet volumes at Badlands contributed to the overall increase, while three Targa systems had significant year-over-year increase. North Texas increased 16%, SAOU increased 21% and Sand Hills increased 5% over the first quarter 2012. Volumes at Versado decreased 5% from last year driven primarily by curtailment caused by maintenance on our third-party pipeline. For the segment, NGL prices decreased 32% while condensate prices decreased 14% and natural gas prices increased by 21% compared to the first quarter of 2012. Turning now to the Coastal Gathering and Processing segment, operating margin decreased 49% in the first quarter compared to last year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower commodity prices, less-favorable frac spreads and lower throughput volume and NGL production. Inlet volumes were up at LOU driven by the addition of the Big Lake plant but were lower across our Coastal Straddles plant, especially from the shutdown of Yscloskey and Calumet plants, which contributed approximately 280 million cubic feet per day to inlet volumes for the segment in the first quarter of 2012, but accounted for less than 1% of total company operating margin. We are beginning to capture some of the volumes that previously went to Yscloskey at our more efficient cryogenic VESCO plant and expect the substitute capture to continue to improve. We expect to transition the vast majority of the processable Yscloskey volumes to Venice. NGL volumes were down at VESCO and remain constraint due to damage incurred to our third-party pipeline. This constraint should be repaired in the next month or so. Next, I’ll provide an overview of the two downstream segments. Starting with the Logistics Assets segment, as Joe Bob mentioned in the opening, first quarter operating margin was a record and increased 31% compared to the first quarter 2012 driven by higher fractionation fees, LPG export activity, treating volumes and petroleum logistics activities. Fractionation volumes declined 12% driven by third-party ethane rejection and certain third-party pipeline curtailment. The effect of lower supplies available for fractionation was partially mitigated by volumes deficiency payment under our standard fracker pay contract. We continue to see high levels of export activity at our Galena Park marine terminal on the Houston Ship Channel. We loaded approximately 45,000 barrels per day of LPG for export in the first quarter more than double the 22,000 barrels per day loaded in the first quarter of 2012. The 45,000 barrels per day volume corresponds over 1.3 million barrels per month. In the Marketing and Distribution segment, operating margin for the segment increased 30% over the first quarter of 2012, due primarily to the significantly higher LPG export activity, increased truck and barge transportation opportunities, and higher wholesale propane margin driven by the colder winter in 2013. These positives were partially offset by decreased NGL prices. With that, let’s now move briefly to capital structure and liquidity. As of March 31st, we had $565 million of outstanding borrowings under the Partnerships $1.2 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due 2017. With outstanding letters of credit of $53 million, revolver availability was about $582 million at quarter end. Total liquidity including approximately $102 million of cash on hand was $684 million. At quarter end, we had borrowings of $111 million under our accounts receivable securitization facility and as of the end of April, we had $147 million borrowed under this facility. Through the end of the first quarter, we received net proceeds of approximately $105 million from equity issuances under our at-the-market equity program which allows us to periodically sell equity at prevailing market prices. Based on Q1 experience, we believe the [ATM] could meet our equity needs over in the course of the year and the program allows us to match the timing of the equity issuances more closely to our capital spending profile. Total funded debt on March 31st was approximately $2.5 billion or about 56% of total capitalization for our first quarter compliance debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which provides adjusted EBITDA credit for material growth projects that are in process but not yet complete and includes other adjustments, was 3.8 times. Next I would like to a few -- make a few comments about our fee-based margin hedging and capital spending programs for the year. We continue to expect operating margins to be over 50% fee-based during 2013 and 55% to 65% during 2014 and beyond, driven by our fee-based expansions, including fractionation, LPG exports and Field Gathering. During the first quarter, we added some additional hedges for natural gas and condensate and more recently added some additional natural gas hedges. For the non-fee based operating margin relative to the Partnerships current equity volumes from Field Gathering and Processing we estimate that we currently have hedge approximately 60% of remaining 2013 natural gas and 50% of remaining 2013 combined NGL and condensate. We are less hedged than in previous years primarily on ethane and propane but our diversity and fee-based improvements reduce the need to hedge commodity prices to previous percentages across all commodities. Moving on to capital spending, we estimate approximately $1 billion of growth capital expenditures in 2013 and expect maintenance CapEx net to our interest to be approximately 75 million. Next I will make a few brief remarks about the results of Targa Resources Corp. On April 16th, TRC declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.4950 per common share or $1.98 per common share on an annualized basis representing an approximately 36% increase over the annualized rate pay with respect to the first quarter of 2012. TRC standalone distributable cash flow for the first quarter of 2013 was $25 million and a declared $21 million in dividends for the quarter. As of March 31st TRC had $72 million in borrowings outstanding under its $150 million senior secured credit facility and $11 million cash resulting in total liquidity of approximately $89 million. That concludes my review. So I’ll turn the call back over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob: Thanks, Matt. To wrap up our prepared remarks, I’d like to review some highlights of the ongoing business in our growth project activity. As you know, our growth opportunities are being driven by the underlying industry dynamics of shale and resource play development, which are increasing volumes for both our Gathering and Processing and our Logistics and Marketing division. These dynamics have allowed us to execute over $1.7 billion of announced growth investments to be placed in the service in 2013 and 2014. Approximately 75% of that total $1.7 billion will provide primarily fee-based margin. By the way, we are very proud of how our people are executing on these projects an impressive on time and on budget track record. Now I’ll provide a quick status update on some of those growth projects currently underway. Our 100,000-barrel per day CBF Train 4 expansion has been delivered on time and on budget and has currently been commissioned. Capacity of Train 4 will be utilized to process Y-grade and advance of the Base Train 4 contracts which begin in August and also to assist while CBF conducts required safety inspections of certain pressure vessels associated with Train 1, 2 and 3 during May through July. Consistent with an estimated timing included in our 2013 fiscal year guidance, we expect CBF Train 4 to meaningfully contribute to third quarter operating margin and to be fully contributing to operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our expanded international export project remains on budget and is ahead of schedule, which might allow us to service a few spot cargos before the term contracts we have signed beginning in October. We expect the project which will enable us to load a total export in excess of 3 million barrels per month to be in service during the third quarter of this year. We also expect to be on time and on budget for additional capability for the third quarter of 2014 bringing total capability in excess of 5 million barrels per month. We continue to see strong demand for capacity reservations under multi-year take or pay contracts. Shifting to petroleum logistics, we continue to work on expansion opportunities around our existing terminals. During the first quarter, we completed a very interesting and technically challenging project at our Sound Terminal in Tacoma, connecting the terminal to an important local products pipeline, adding additional storage and adding ethanol biodiesel and gasoline blending capabilities. Since last year our Sound facility has handled manifest rail cars of Bakken crude for Washington State refineries. Although this service was temporarily interrupted due to issues raised by state regulator, we’ve resumed the services and are working with the regulator to resolve any remaining issues. Even if some of those issues remain, we do not see any material financial impact. Shifting to Gathering and Processing, a 200 million a day Longhorn plant in North Texas is expected to be placed in service in the Q4 of 2013 assuming a near-term approval of its greenhouse gas permit. I know you’ve heard that before but everything is complete on the permit and the public notice period is over. Assuming there are no adverse comments and we do not expect any, we expect to receive the permit within a few weeks. As you know Permian Basin producer activity is very high, producers are drilling more horizontal wells in the Wolfberry for SAOU system. Similarly, decline is experienced in significant activity in and around our system. Sand Hills continues to benefit from the Wolfberry on the east side of the system Bone Springs and Avalon on the west side and continue to success in other formations in the center. In addition, the producers continue to improve their drilling and completion techniques across the entire Permian Basin, and that continues to have positive results for our systems. The recent completions of two 30 million a day expansions, one at SAOU and one at Sand Hills are up and running and are expected to be fully utilized in the near future. The 200 million a day High Plains plant at SAOU announced in the fourth quarter of 2012 is still on track to be finished in mid 2014 and has all required permits. Given the level of current and expected future producer activity in the Permian Basin, we continue to evaluate and work on additional Permian Basin processing capacity expansion opportunities. The Badlands acquisition is very similar to our other growth projects and is still very early in the growth capital investment phase. We continue to work hard integrating and growing the Badlands asset. Some of our construction efforts this winter were more difficult due to the North Dakota winter which was significantly colder and longer than last year. However, we are even more enthusiastic about the long-term potential of these assets than when we purchased them late last year. We’re still aided by a transition services agreement from the seller and we have made significant recent integration process -- progress on all fronts, including hiring additional field personnel, project managers and commercial representatives. Our commercial strategy is about providing connectivity to best serve our producer customers. This commercial strategy really has two focuses. One, they’ll be in the backbone and laterals and making connections to producer wells in close coordination with their drilling plans and two, providing multiple interconnections from our system to pipeline, trucking, rail delivery places to allow our producers the optionality to ensure takeaway and to optimize the price for their production. We currently have seven or more such interconnects in place or pending in the near-term with more in the works. Largely because of our ability to deliver on the connectivity strategy and partially because we’ve got a first mover advantage, we have also been very successful with our commercial efforts to add acreage dedications and other commitments. So far this year, we have signed contracts or added contract dedications for approximately 40,000 incremental acres, providing further expansion to additional markets. We are also negotiating documentation for deals with a very high probability of adding more than three to four times of that much acreage again. And we are working on other deals that could add even more acreage in connectivity. We continued to expect to spend approximately $250 million or more in 2013 to expand the system to serve acreage dedications and to provide connectivity and takeaway options for our producer customers. In addition to our announced capital expenditure program, we continued to develop other projects, some of which are known in the industry and have been referenced in our investment materials. Although, they're not officially approved by our Board, those projects include CBF Train 5, unit train facility projects to receive transport at crude oil and other potential gas gathering and processing projects, particularly in Permian Basin. We're still optimistic about these potential projects. We expect the impact from our highly visible growth projects to provide the margin, scale and diversity that will support continued distribution growth in 2013, 2014 and beyond. As you can tell from our comments today, we are very pleased with the strong performance across our businesses in the current environment and we're equally excited about the expansion projects we have underway and the prospects for adding to our growth portfolio. This solid performance underpins our comfort with our guidance, including EBITDA and distribution and dividend growth. So with that, we will open it up to questions. And I will turn it back to the operator.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bradley Olsen with Tudor, Pickering.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor Pickering: Good morning, guys.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hey, Brad. Good morning.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor Pickering: So, obviously, you’ve guys have already talked about a dock expansion and have been very active down on the Ship Channel. But in light of two dynamic that have kind of emerge over the last quarter, one of those being a proposal of a pipeline to take Y-grade from the Marcellus down to the Gulf coast, the second of those being a dislocation and U.S. butane prices. Do you see opportunities -- incremental opportunities to expand given that you already have the footprint that I think some folks coming out of the Marcellus are looking for and do you see an opportunity to expand what has been mostly a propane focus export expansion into the butane side of things?
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Brad. I was actually getting some additional input and I’m glad because I would have forgotten to mention it. But you are right. Those are two very interesting and important dynamics. First, we've been expecting more or Marcellus Y-grade, Marcellus and Utica Year-grade to come to the Gulf Coast, started with enterprise project and the Boardwalk-Williams project is the best of those to turnaround. That brings only opportunities for us in the Gulf coast. And that product showing up comes to Targa assets that are very well-positioned to help. The dynamic Y-grade trying to get to marketing, getting to the Mont Belvieu and Galena Park benefit us and we were expecting it and are working with parties who were also expecting it. The [dislocation] in butanes, yeah, we’ve been seeing that and we are working with other parties. You are aware of our Patriot dock acquisition, which allows us to expand our Galena Park capabilities and removing the bottlenecks that might occur, as we try to handle multiple LPG from Galena Park, and expand our ability to do so. I think I will probably leave it at that. But commercial opportunities continue to increase and those are two dynamics that we think are favorable.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor Pickering: That’s very helpful. On the Bakken or the Babylon side of your business, when you made the acquisition you discussed roughly $250 million of additional capital expenditures that were needed to get the system kind of where you wanted it in light of any dynamics to that that you’ve observed in the last 180 days or so. Do you see incremental opportunities beyond that original $250 million? Have you been -- have there been any developments in the Bakken that have contrasted or compared with your original model case, and whether those be field gathering or an expansion of potential kind of rail loading facilities?
Joe Bob Perkins: Well, that was a lot of questions, Brad. I will try to hit them all. First of all, the $250 million that we described, when we first made the acquisition was consistent with what was on the drawing board for 2013. It’s not getting the system to where we want to get it. We are going to be doing that in ‘13 and ‘14 and I see more opportunities not less opportunities than when we acquired it. And I’m not trying to be subtle, but we have been saying $250 million or more for 2013 and we haven't yet given guidance for 2014. We will do that in the fall of this year. Has anything changed relative to our model of Bakken and announcements in the Bakken? I do follow -- I try to follow the entire Bakken, but we have continued discussions with contracted producers and perspective producers in and around our system and I’m focused there. I can’t share that. I do view every public announcement from those producers with a highlighted part about what's happening in and around our system and I’m looking at the person who actually helps me do that work. And here's where I come out, is the activity in and around our system is better than we thought it was going to be, number one. Number two, the number of completions per trailing unit in and around our system are better than we thought it was going to be over time. And number three, the productivity of all of the completions that we are seeing are better than we thought it was going to be, when we made the acquisition. So if my enthusiasm is a little too loud, those are the reasons. It’s just the information has gotten better or not for three of those.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor Pickering: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And just one last question. Condensate pricing in our Field Gathering and Processing segment have fallen about 15% year-on-year. Is that, as you think about the build out of your Patriot acquisition? Is condensate exports or condensate handling a potential avenue that you could pursue going forward? That’s it for me. Thanks.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yeah. When we made the announcement of the possibilities of Patriot, we said refine products as well as NGLs and you are correct. Condensate is one of the things that we are talking about. That’s Patriot. I should also say that Patriot works nicely with the Galena Park, but we also have a Channelview facility on the Ship Channel that has those same opportunities.
Operator: Our next question comes from Darren Horowitz with Raymond James.
Darren Horowitz - Raymond James: Joe Bob, I just have one question for you. As it relates to your commentary around what you are seeing in the Permian, whether or not it’s a Wolfberry activity or decline or what’s driving a lot of those inlet volumes through Sand Hills. How much more capacity, as you are talking with producers, do you think it’s going to be necessary in order to keep the market effectively balance without degrading price?
Joe Bob Perkins: The producer opportunity seem to increase every time I look and the Permian Basin is one of the most economic basins in the country and in the world. But when we say degrading price, we have two, three levels. Increases in U.S. production, really is not degrading global prices because it is cost competitively advantaged. At the same time there could be temporary dislocations in oil prices by markets sub hub. The Permian Basin is pretty well-connected for moving oil out. I think that’s one thing that producers have enjoyed about it. If WTI has varius discounts relative to Brent, that’s against the global. But WTI ability to get out of Permian is being improved as we speak. We are not yet involved in any of those projects, but we feel good about them. Anything else?
Darren Horowitz - Raymond James: That's all I have, Joe Bob. I appreciate it.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hey, you bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Maresca with Morgan Stanley.
Steven Maresca - Morgan Stanley: Good morning, everybody.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hey, how you doing? Good morning.
Steven Maresca - Morgan Stanley: I’m doing well. Thanks. Question on the -- you mentioned, Joe Bob, 3 million barrels a day a month by third quarter ‘13 export. Is that all propane or is that a mix?
Joe Bob Perkins: No. In fact, one of my colleagues was saying during the very first question, I should have clarify, that part of that butane question is, we -- typically is probably an okay word, have to 25% to 30% of those total exports being butane, the rest being propane. And as we come on for the VLGCs in the third quarter, most of the offtake agreements provide options for butane to be a part of the cargos and I would expect that they would be.
Steven Maresca - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And what do you have to do to go from that three to five in terms of infrastructure or CapEx and how likely is that?
Joe Bob Perkins: To go from 3 to 5…
Steven Maresca - Morgan Stanley: You mentioned it’s going to 5 million by third quarter.
Joe Bob Perkins: It’s a 100% likely.
Steven Maresca - Morgan Stanley: Okay.
Joe Bob Perkins: First of all. And second of all, those are sort of round numbers and my capability maybe a little larger than that in the third quarter of 2013 and little larger than that in third quarter of 2014. So I don’t want to mislead anyone. The types of project things that we have to do is increase some pipeline capacity and improve our dock space. We had some refrigeration as well. Mike, what did I leave off? That's the high level. And we’re always adding utilities and making sure it all does well.
Michael Heim: All of those contracts have been left and all of it is under construction.
Joe Bob Perkins: Mike, does not let us say, expect on time and on budget unless he is really expecting on time and on budget. And I want to say it again I’m really proud of our execution on all of these projects. We’re establishing a really good track record.
Steven Maresca - Morgan Stanley: And then you mentioned also you’re still being able to get multiyear take-or-pay contracts. Is the market shifting at all or are you able for all these exports to majority or what would that be, 90% or more, is it under these type of multiyear take-or-pays?
Joe Bob Perkins: Well, I haven’t announced percentages that are under those take-or-pays.
Steven Maresca - Morgan Stanley: Okay.
Joe Bob Perkins: The existing capacity has multiyear contracts but we’ve also been able to handle more than we thought we could. So we have some spot cargos as well. The 2013 third quarter expansion for international grade propane along with butanes is completely contracted but we maybe able to work some spot volumes in above that. And we see very high demand for contracting and have already contracting volumes that will begin in 2014 associated with that additional expansion.
Steven Maresca - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then final question, shifting gears to Badlands, appreciating you haven’t had it for a long while yet. What -- can you discuss a little bit of impacts of rail up in that region for this business going forward?
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay.
Steven Maresca - Morgan Stanley: Just love to hear some thoughts on that?
Joe Bob Perkins: I’m borrowing a quote that I liked a lot. Some one else created it. To a great extent, the Badlands system is agnostic to how crude leaves. But been agnostic wasn’t to get producers the way to get out that they want at any particular time, which is to connect them by pipe better than they currently are. They wanted to go by truck. They wanted to go by rail or if they wanted to go from available pipeline capacity out of the area. Our connectivity strategy is all about that. Right now, crude going from our system may leave in a truck, may leave in a pipe. It may ultimately go away on rail. And our anticipation is to sort of agree with the industry view that rail has a long-term future for the Bakken. Leaving the Bakken, we’re preparing for rail. Leaving the Bakken to catch it either on the west coast through the east coast and help people with that as well.
Steven Maresca - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thanks very much guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from TJ Shultz from RBC Capital Markets.
TJ Shultz - RBC Capital Markets: Sorry, if I missed this. But did you or can you provide the margin impact that Badlands had on field G&P during the first quarter?
Joe Bob Perkins: No. I didn’t provide that. And I would also say that whatever is in the queue is probably not as helpful as you would like it to be. But what I did say is that when you look going forward for the rest of 2013, the combination of Badlands and other things going on with projects, CBF Train 4, coming on -- the export facilities coming on is perfectly on track with the guidance we provided in our last call.
TJ Shultz - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks. I guess, just a follow-up on the Patriot Terminal again. Is the current thought there to take more domestic rate propane through Patriot or is there an opportunity for more butanes there? And then I guess as you look at optimizing the opportunities there, the initial investment was relatively modest, can you give us any idea of what type of growth capital would be required to develop some of these capabilities?
Joe Bob Perkins: First of all, our initial thoughts in January that we shared with you was a strategy of both working refined products and LPGs in conjunction with Galena Park. That’s still our strategy because we are in commercial discussions with potential customers that will back the additional capital investment. I wouldn’t want to go into more details than that but that still is our strategy which is refined products and overtime been able to help Galena Park with additional LPGs. Yeah. That’s all we would want to share but it was -- they are very complementary asset with a lot of commercial interest.
TJ Shultz - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks. Fair Enough. I guess, just lastly the rail unloading and barge loading project at Tacoma. I think you said you’re back to taking manifest trains. When would you expect to be able to start planning unit train capabilities there?
Joe Bob Perkins: I haven’t announced when we might start unit train capabilities there but we have said as we’re continuing to work on it.
TJ Shultz - RBC Capital Markets: Fair Enough. Thanks guys.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hey, Michael, good morning.
Michael Blum - Wells Fargo: Good morning. I was curious if you could just expand. You said part of the slight downtick in frac volumes was third-party pipeline curtailment. So are you talking about NGL lines into Belvieu as long as you can just expand upon that to extent you can?
Joe Bob Perkins: Yeah. NGL pipeline capacity into Belvieu experienced constraints in the first quarter. They were just full. That is -- I'm sorry, what you said. Yeah, there were full and one of them in particular that we saw had to go down for maintenance, also a little longer than they had planned. What was -- that was the second part to your question.
Michael Blum - Wells Fargo: No. That was the first question. The second question is a similar question on constraints but in the Permian, are you seeing any constraints as it relates to natural gas takeaway, associated gas takeaway out of the Permian through your system or just in general?
Joe Bob Perkins: Broadly, under Permian basin, as volumes have increased, people have been working around natural gas system which was designed for a lot more than it’s currently producing but compressor stations have been taken away and pipes have been derated. So I think you’ll see people working on that overtime. There are some constraints and there is also a nitrogen issue out there that we’re seeing.
Michael Blum - Wells Fargo: Okay. And then last question is really just a point of clarification. When you talk about these acreage dedications around the Badlands system, are you talking about associated gas, oil, both or mix, what exactly?
Joe Bob Perkins: I won’t give you exactly right now but we have announced an initial acreage dedications of oil, separate from gas, part of the reasons, lot of the gas is already committed. And we have more oil than we have oil and gas and we have a little bit, I think of maybe just gas. Of the acreage dedications, that occurred in the first quarter that I just announced, I didn’t give specificity about oil relative to gas but so far it’s primarily oil.
Michael Blum - Wells Fargo: Right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Matt Black] with HITE..
Joe Bob Perkins: I’m sorry didn’t get the name.
Unidentified Analyst:  This is [Matt Black] with Hype. There are two quick questions is, first one is when you think about your propane and butane exports business, there seems to be market really accelerating. If you think three to five years down the line, what’s your vision for the kind of volume in each one of those products, you could see going through your system?
Joe Bob Perkins: My vision. A lot -- many of those volumes go through our system whether they get exported or not. We’ve announced capability of providing $5 million barrels a day by the end of 2014. That’s the capacity. My vision is we wouldn’t have built that if we didn’t think we could use a significant portion of that capacity.
Unidentified Analyst: And $5 million a month.
Joe Bob Perkins: Sorry. That’s 5 million barrels per month which is how we tend to think about it. I also think about barrels per ship but that’s a little more complicated to describe.
Unidentified Analyst: Given the volume of NGL production ramp in this country and strategic location that you have, is there another leg beyond that -- that you could leverage with your assets?
Joe Bob Perkins: Potentially.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then given the significance of your CapEx program over the course of the coming year and the opportunities that you have, how urgent is your need to come back to equity markets and have you thought about alternatives such as pipes that may reduce the need for the LP to do overnight?
Joe Bob Perkins: We were always thinking about it. Matt is the person who thinks the most. He gets up in the morning. In Q1, I would say that we were pleased with the amount of equity we raised to $105 million through the ATM program. At that rate, we don't necessarily even see that as ceiling. There was some pretty light activity in March in just trading volume. So raising $100 million or so on a quarterly basis gets us a long way to the equity needs for the CapEx program we have this year.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. That continues to be successful. It's possible you wouldn’t even need to do it overnight 
Joe Bob Perkins: If we’re able to raise the amount we need in the ATM but it’s based on market conditions, so to say during -- if Q1 is a good proxy of if we’re able to raise money, yeah, puts us in good position to use the ATM for the balance of our equity over the year.
Unidentified Analyst: Fantastic. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Louis Shamie with Zimmer Partners.
Louis Shamie - Zimmer Partners: Hi. Good morning everyone.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning.
Louis Shamie - Zimmer Partners: So, my question is kind of around the Badlands asset. We saw CenterPoint kind of make a step out and announce that they were going to build a crude oil facility up around that same area. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment there and kind of the advantages that you might have versus other you may try to get business in that area?
Joe Bob Perkins: We don’t expect to be participating without competition in a very attractive area. I saw that CenterPoint open season for non-existing asset also. We have other competition there. I want to put us in a position and working very heard to put us in a position of being the midstream provider that is doing the best in the area to meet the producers’ needs. And we have though admittedly very new assets, assets in place, connectivity strategy that gets them very soon to seven different points for delivery that’s -- I hate to ever say competitive advantage but that's at least a pretty good head start. And the producer customers that we already have dedicated to the system and are adding acreage or considering dedicate into the system, I think see that as advantage to their needs.
Louis Shamie - Zimmer Partners: Yeah. That’s great. And in terms of Train 5 of CBF, what’s the outlook there?
Joe Bob Perkins: Sometimes our federal government helps us in ways that don’t benefit business or customers. And the outlook for there is for us to go to our Board, get that approved and build it once we have a permit, as Mike announce last fall. I still feel very good about project. I don’t feel very good about process that’s gotten us to getting the permit but our competitors are facing some of the same issues.
Louis Shamie - Zimmer Partners: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from (inaudible) with Millenium.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. It’s (inaudible) and thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to clarify some of the comments around the LPG export capacity. I know, you’ve gone through this but I was a little bit confused looking at the couple of different numbers and units. Would you mind us reviewing briefly the various increments of capacity that come on line and went over the course of next two years?
Joe Bob Perkins: Sure. Speaking in barrels per month, we are -- we currently have capability of over a million barrels per month of domestic grade propane or butane exports loading medium size or smaller ships. Beginning in the third quarter of 2013, we will have added a significant chunk of capability which adds an incremental 2 million plus barrels per month of international grade propane or butanes on the VLGCs, very large ships. Similarly in the third quarter of 2014, we will add another 2 million barrels per month plus international grade propane or butanes for servicing export needs.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. And I believe you may reference to the fact that the phase one expansion was proceeding a little bit ahead of schedule and it was possible that it might come on and be able to service some spot barrels before your contracts become effective in third quarter. Is that correct?
Joe Bob Perkins: That’s pretty well known in the industry, and I just wanted to go ahead and recognize that. We are already having discussions with our current customers and potential other customers. We will probably give it to our current customers for those spot cargos.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And I guess when, what month do you expect it to come online and when, what month of the contract, do the contracts or the capacity begin?
Joe Bob Perkins: We did say what month the contracts begin. There is only a little bit of time before that in the quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: Which month is that that you said?
Joe Bob Perkins: We said contract month was October.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan.
Jeremy Tonet - J.P. Morgan: Good morning, gentlemen.
Joe Bob Perkins: Good morning.
Jeremy Tonet - J.P. Morgan: I just had a question around ethane rejection and are you seeing that much in your areas of operation on the Gathering and Processing side? And then with the fractionators, the volumes came in lower this morning -- this quarter because of the ethane rejection now, although you are covered by the take or pay commitments there. I was just wondering if that trend has continued into this quarter, and how you think that might trend over the course the year?
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay. First, let’s start in the Gathering and Processing and you said that we see ethane rejection in our systems. Starting with the Targa systems, we’ve had -- we barely had to regard to constraints but we had to react to pipeline constraints on the margin. We were in super good position because we had foreseen some of this and got an additional pipeline capacity, while waiting for the new pipelines to come out, so almost no rejection from Targa Gathering and Processing systems. We have ways we can work it by getting rid of liquids in local markets and that sort of thing. We did see in other Gathering and Processing systems, because we can see the pipelines coming into our Mount Belvieu facilities that other parties, particularly from the Permian for example. We are having to reject because it impacted, what was the ethane content coming into Mount Belvieu. In the Mid Continent and Rocky Mountains, we saw economic rejections, not a function of pipeline constraints. But probably a function of economic rejections though we weren’t pulling those levers. We were just observing it and I think I agree with industry news that it was occurring Moving to our fractionation volumes that resulted in slightly lower fractionation volumes, but the primary driver for that was the pipeline constraint for maintenance. And they weren’t off very much. And it wasn’t even hardly economically significant, certainly not as economically significant as the rolling up of fractionation rates but you’re also correct. It was partially mitigated by the take or pay contracts in those take or pay we described as typically 90% of volumes. It’s not surprising that some customer might not be ramped up to their total volume commitment level, yet, while expecting to ramp up to that quickly. We are largely covered by the frac or pay is probably better term than take or pay, largely covered by the frac or pay commitments until those volumes pick up to full expectations.
Jeremy Tonet - J.P. Morgan: That’s helpful color. Thank you.
Operator: I’m not showing any further question at this time. I’d like to turn the conference back over to our host for closing remarks.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Targa Resources Year-End 2012 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator instructions). As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Chris McEwan.
Chris McEwan: Thank you, operator. I’d like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and full year 2012 investor call for both Targa Resources Corp and Targa Resources Partners LP. Before we get started, I would like to mention that Targa Resources Corp., TRC, or the Company and Targa Resources Partners LP, Targa Resources Partners or the Partnership have published their joint earnings release which is available on our website [ph] www.taragaresources.com. We will also be posting an updated investor presentation to the website after the call. Speaking on the call today will be Joe Bob Perkins, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Meloy, Chief Financial Officer. Joe Bob and Matt are going to be comparing the fourth quarter and full year 2012 results to prior period results as well as providing additional color on our results, business performance, and other matters of interest. I would like to remind you that any statements made during this call might include the Company’s or the Partnership’s expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Please note that actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings, including the Partnership’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. With that, I’ll turn it over to Joe Bob Perkins.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Chris. Welcome and thanks to everyone for participating. Besides Matt and myself there are several other members of the management team who will be available to assist in the Q&A session. For today’s call I’ll start off with a high-level review of performance and highlights. I will then turn it over to Matt to review the Partnership’s consolidated financial results, its segment results and other financial matters for the Partnership. Matt will also review key financial matters related to Targa Resources Corp. Following Matt’s comments, I’ll provide some concluding remarks and then we’ll take your questions. We’re really pleased to announce that 2012 was a record year for Targa on many fronts. Record adjusted EBITDA, $515 million. Record distributable cash flow of $354 million. Over $540 million of organic growth CapEx. 13% distribution growth at the Partnership and a 36% dividend growth at TRC. The underlying fundamentals of our business are strong as we were able to achieve full year 2012 EBITDA within our initial guidance range despite 25% lower NGL prices than our guidance assumptions, despite an $8 million impact from Hurricane Isaac and despite $6 million worth of transaction-related expenses for the Bakken Shale Midstream acquisition. These results included record-operating margin for our logistics and marketing division which was up 29% compared to 2011 driven by higher fractionation fees, record LPG export services volume which benefits both our logistics assets and our marketing and distribution segments. Contribution from our petroleum logistics terminals that we acquired in 2011 and increased trading fees resulting from benzene trading project placed in service early in 2012, a very good year for the logistics and marketing division. We also saw continued strong producer activity across our Field Gathering and Processing segment despite the fall in NGL prices. Natural gas plant inlet volumes for our Field Gathering and Processing segment increased 12% with volumes up in all four business units, North Texas, Sand Hills, SAOU, and Versado. As you are probably aware, activity in our three Permian Basin business units, like much of the Permian Basin is very high; driven by oil prices and improved technology. We are also pleased to announce the closing of our strategic acquisition of Midstream assets serving producers in the Bakken Shale. This $950 million acquisition closed at the end of the day on December 31 and it had no impact on our results of operations for 2012 other than the transaction cost related to the acquisition. Going forward, we will be calling this business Targa Badlands and results will be reported in our Field Gathering and Processing segment. We’ve only owned this business for 45 days but our people are working hard with the assistance of a very good transition services agreement in members of the Saddle Butte team to continue the construction projects, meet customer needs, further commercialize the facilities and integrate the businesses. This new acquisition will provide us with additional business diversity, scale and long-term growth. Badlands expands the target footprint into one of the fastest growing crude oil basins in the world where we will handle crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs while adding rapidly growing fee-based EBITDA. We are excited about the long-term growth outlook for these assets and expect to invest $250 million in 2013 to bring us additional fee-based accretion in 2014 and beyond. As mentioned previously, we spent a record $540 million of organic growth CapEx in 2012. And importantly, we placed in service projects totaling approximately $200 million of growth capital during the year of 2012. Now, for 2013, we will set another record by spending approximately $1 billion in growth CapEx and we will place in service projects totaling over $1.1 billion of organic growth capital during 2013. The majority of that $1.1 billion to be placed in service in 2013 will add fee-based margin. And it will be online and contributing to EBITDA in the back half of the year. Meaning, we should exit 2013 with a much higher rate EBITDA than we have begun 2013. Due to this large capital spending program and the timing of several major projects slated to come on line in the backend of 2013, we continue to expect the first half 2013 distribution coverage to be weaker than historical average. As we stated previously, the Badlands acquisition is expected to be dilutive to 2013, then accretive in 2014 and beyond as we work to expand the assets, do the construction, and increase the operating margin over time. For the first half of 2013, we expect our distribution coverage to be around 0.9 times given the impact of the Badlands acquisition on 2013. We expect distribution coverage to improve in the second half of 2013, averaging about 1 times for the full year. We are excited about the long-term growth outlook for our business and expect to soon return to our long-term target coverage ratio of 1.2 times. With high visibility and confidence on the 2014 performance and our strong balance sheet and liquidity, we believe we’re on the right path. We also increased the Partnership’s full year 2012 distribution 13% over 2011 consistent with our original 2012 full year distribution guidance. Given in the fall of 2011 as a 10% to 15% increase, a little pass the midpoint. At the TRC level, our full year 2012 dividends of $1.64 represented 36% growth over 2011. Also just pass the midpoint of our original 30% to 40% growth guidance given for 2012. We continue to expect to deliver full year 2013 distribution growth of 10% to 12% at the Partnership and expect to exceed 30% TRC dividend growth for 2013. That wraps up my initial comments and I’ll hand it over to Matt.
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Joe Bob. I’d like to add my welcome and thank you for joining our call today. Joe Bob discussed some full year 2012 records and highlights, so let’s turn our attention to Q4 results. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $131 million or $137 million excluding $6 million in acquisition fees and expenses related to our acquisition of Badlands. This compares to $146 million for the same period last year. The decrease was primarily the result of lower operating margins in our gathering and processing division drive by weaker commodity prices partially offset by a 29% increase in our logistics and marketing division largely due to the higher LPG export activity. Operating margin decreased 6% for the fourth quarter compared to last year. I will review the drivers of this performance in our segment review. Please note as Joe Bob mentioned, the Badlands acquisition did not contribute to 2012 operating results. We will include the Badlands results beginning in the first quarter of 2013. Gross maintenance capital expenditures were $19.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $24.6 million in 2011 adjusting for the non-controlling interest portion of maintenance CapEx. In certain reimbursements from TRC to the Partnership net maintenance CapEx were $18.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $17.1 million in 2011. Turning to the segment level, I’ll summarize our fourth quarter’s performance on a year-over-year basis. We’ll start with our Gathering and Processing segments. Field Gathering and Processing operating margin decreased by approximately 32% compared to last year driven by lower NGL and natural gas prices and by higher operating expenses due to additional compression and maintenance cost associated with system expansion. These effects were partially offset by increased natural gas plant inlet volumes. Please note that these segments do not include the impact of our hedging program even though the hedging program is primarily associated with this segment. Fourth quarter 2012 natural gas plant inlet for the Field Gathering and Processing segments was 720 million cubic feet per day, a 14% increase compared to the same period in 2011. All of the Field Gathering and Processing business units were up on volume for the quarter as well as for the year as Joe Bob mentioned. Natural gas inlet volumes increased by approximately 19% at the North Texas and SAOU; 5% at Sand Hills; and 10% at Versado. These increases were attributable to new well connects across the system and less downtime for operational issues. For the segment, NGL prices decreased 39% while condensate prices decreased 9% and natural gas prices decreased 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Turning now to the Coastal Gathering and Processing segment; operating margin decreased 57% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower commodity prices, less-favorable frac spreads and lower throughput lines. Volumes were up at VESCO and LOU but were lower at our other Coastal Straddles plant, especially from the shutdown of the Yscloskey plant which had previously contributed to inlet volumes for the segment but had a minimal impact to operating margins. We are beginning to capture some of the volumes that previously went to Yscloskey at our more efficient cryogenic Venice plant and expect the substitute capture to continue to improve. Next, I’ll provide an overview of the two segments in the downstream business. Starting with the Logistics Assets segment, fourth quarter operating margin increased 32% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 due to higher fractionation and treating volumes and higher export volumes partially offset by increased operating expenses driven by higher system maintenance costs. Export activity at our Galena Park marine terminal on the Houston Ship Channel increased again this quarter with LPG export volumes of 1 million to 1.5 million barrels per month currently being loaded onto small and medium-sized vessels. In the Marketing and Distribution segment, operating margin for the segment increased 25% over the fourth quarter of 2011 due primarily to favorable whole sale marketing opportunities drive by regional supply conditions and increased LPG export service activity. With that, let’s now move briefly to capital structure and liquidity. At December 31, we had $620 million of outstanding borrowings under the Partnership’s $1.2 billion senior secured revolving credit facility to 2017. With outstanding letters of credit of $45 million, revolver availability was about $535 million at year end. Total liquidity including approximately $68 million of cash on hand was approximately $603 million. Total funded debt on December 31 was approximately $2.4 billion or about 56% of total capitalization and our year-end compliance debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.8 times. On October 25, we issued $400 million note offering, a 5.25 notes due May 2023. The proceeds were used to call all of our outstanding 8.25 notes due 2016 and to reduce borrowings on our revolving credit facility. On November 15, we issued a public offering of 10.9 million common units at $36 per share resulting $393 million of proceeds including the contribution by TRC to maintain its 2% GP interest. The proceeds were used to partially fund the Badlands acquisition. On December 4, we issued a $200 million note offering of 5.25 notes due May 2023 as an addition to our existing 400 million aggregates principal amount of 5.25 notes. The proceeds were used for general partnership purposes including funding a portion of the Badlands acquisition. We have already had a productive start to 2013 financing activity. On January 10, we closed our $200 million accounts receivable securitization facility which increases our liquidity and provides a lower cost funding source relative to other outstanding debt. As of the end of January, we had $171 million of outstanding borrowings under this facility. Through January, we have received net proceeds of approximately $65 million from equity issuances under our at-the-market equity program which allows us to periodically sell equity at prevailing market prices. Pro forma for the accounts receivable securitization facility and equity issued in January, our current revolver availability is approximately $770 million leaving us with ample flexibility to fund our growth investment from 2013. On a debt compliance basis, which provides us adjusted EBITDA credit from material growth projects that are in process but not yet complete and makes other adjustments, our pro forma total leverage including the financings in January 2013 was 3.5 times in the middle of our stated 3 to 4 times on a compliance basis. Next I’d like to make a few comments about our hedging and capital spending programs for the year. We expect operating margins to be over 50% fee based during 2013 and 55% to 65% during 2014 and beyond. For the non-fee based operating margin relative to the Partnership’s current equity volumes from Field Gathering and Processing. We estimate we have hedged approximately 50% of 2013 natural gas and 50% of 2013 combined NGL and condensate. We are less hedged than in previous years but our diversity and fee-based improvements reduce the need to hedge commodity prices to previous percentages across all commodities. Furthermore, we do not have much appetite for hedging ethane or propane at the current market or at the current forward prices. We do not want to lock in pricing at these levels. We may hedge more butanes and natural gasoline and we will likely hedge more natural gas and condensate. Moving on to capital spending, we estimate approximately $1 billion of growth capital expenditures in 2013 with $1.1 billion of growth CapEx placed in service. We expect maintenance capital net to our interest to be approximately 75 million for the year. Next I will make a few brief remarks about the results of Targa Resources Corp. On January 15, TRC declared a fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.4575 per common share or $1.83 per common share on annualized basis representing in approximately 36% increase over the annualized rate pay with respect to the fourth quarter of 2011. TRC standalone distributable cash flow for the quarter, for the fourth quarter 2012 was $24.7 million and a declared $19.4 million in dividends for the quarter. At year end TRC had $82 million in borrowings outstanding under its $150 million senior secured credit facility and $8 million resulting in total liquidity of $72 million. That concludes my review. So I’ll now turn the call back over to Joe Bob.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Matt. To wrap up the final portion of our prepared remarks, I would like to review some highlights of our growth project activity. As you know, our growth opportunities are being driven by the underlying industry dynamics of shale and resource play development, which is increasing business for both our Gathering and Processing division and our Logistics and Marketing division. These dynamics have allowed us to announce over $1.7 billion of growth investments to be placed in service in 2013 and 2014. $1.3 billion of that total $1.7 billion growth investments over the next two years will be providing primarily fee-based margin, which further insulates us from commodity price volatility. So here’s a quick status update on some of the growth projects currently underway that I know you’re following. Our 100,000-barrel per day CBF Train 4 expansion will be placed into service in the second quarter of this year as expected. During the course of construction, we have strategically increased selected scope to accommodate future growth, raising the total budget to $385 million from $360 million announced previously. This minor increase in expenditures significantly advantages future projects. Our expanded international export project remains on time and on budget. We expect the project which will enable us to load in excess of 3 million barrels per month to be in service during the third quarter of this year. When completed, we will be able to load in excess of 5 million barrels per month during the third quarter of 2014. We have already entered into multi-year take or pay contracts for the majority of the capacity of the projects and have seen longer terms for the most recent contracts. Our 200 million cubic feet a day Longhorn plant in North Texas is expected to be placed in service in the third quarter of 2013 assuming a near-term approval of its greenhouse permit. We believe that everything is complete on the permit and expect it soon but have been disappointed with the speed of final federal approval. We’ll let you know when we get the permit. The 200 million cubic feet a day High Plains plant at SAOU announced in the fourth quarter of 2012 is still on track to be finished on time in mid 2014 and has all the required permits. Given the level of producer activity and future focus in the Permian Basin, we are very excited about this project and the recent completions of two 300 million cubic feet a day expansions –
Matt Meloy: That’s –
Joe Bob Perkins: Two 30 million cubic feet a day expansions in SAOU in Sand Hill. Sometimes I can talk better than I can read. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are busy at work integrating Badlands into Targa. Badlands is also an early stage growth project. In addition to our integration and commercialization efforts, we expect to spend approximately $250 million in 2013 to expand the system and to provide additional connectivity to both rail and pipeline takeaway options for our producer customers and to secure further acreage dedications. We recently completed a $35 million expansion of our Sound Terminal in Tacoma to greatly enhance our ability to serve the local and regional markets. The project connected the terminal to an important local products pipeline, added 225,000 barrels of storage and added ethanol and gasoline blending to the truck loading rack to increase the clean fuels available to the Puget Sound market. At Sound, we are also handling rail cars of Bakken crude for Washington State and West Coast refineries. In addition to these announced projects, we continue to develop other projects that have not yet been officially approved by our Board; some of which are known in the industry and have been referenced in our investor materials. Those ongoing projects with some visibility include CBF Train 5, a unit train facility and others. We are still optimistic about these projects. We expect the impact from these highly visible growth projects and others like them to provide the margin, scale and diversity that will support continued distribution growth in 2013 and beyond. Even with the acquisition of Badlands we continue to have substantial liquidity to fund our current announced slate of growth projects and to provide us flexibility to further expand our diversified Midstream platform for even longer term growth. 2013 will be a transformational year for Targa. We have approximately $1.1 billion in growth capital that will be placed in service and be up and running by the fourth quarter. The majority of these new projects and service will contribute fee-based margin. These projects are expected to be completed at attractive EBITDA multiples, meaning that our run rate EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2013 will be a step change from where we ended 2012 and where we are today. And this enhanced end of year 2013 EBITDA performance should result in a 2014 EBITDA growth in excess of 25% over 2013. As I mentioned earlier in the call, we continue to expect to deliver full year 2013 distribution growth of 10% to 12% at the Partnership and expect to exceed 30% TRC dividend growth for 2013.
Operator: (Operator instructions). Our first question from the line of Bradley Olsen with Tudor Pickering Holt. Your line is open.
Bradley Olsen – Tudor Pickering Holt: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hey, Brad.
Bradley Olsen – Tudor Pickering Holt: First question is about the results reported in the Marketing segment. You noted in the press release this morning that a decent piece of that, of the increase was a result of activity that the LPG export done. I was hoping that you might be able to maybe just qualitatively walk through how much of that was due to maybe contract roll over a new higher fee structure or any market-based opportunities that you guys were able to take advantage of during the quarter.
Joe Bob Perkins: Thanks, Brad. First of all, I think everybody is wondering if the first note out gets the first question. There’s no correlation but your was the first one I saw this morning. I know you would like more color on that. I think the right color to provide is that things are going well in that whole segment that we have had additional margin performance coming from exports, more volumes and attractive contracts. We also had very good performance in our wholesale division. This is a good season for wholesale and they have managed to use their assets, rolling assets like trucks and rail cars, people who are very good at responding to opportunities to meet customer needs and capture margin there as well.
Bradley Olsen – Tudor Pickering Holt: Great. Thanks. And as far as the CapEx, the CapEx outlook that you provided, that was very helpful and I think just kind of building on maybe one of the comments you made about a potential unit train facility, can you discuss in any further detail kind of how you’re thinking about the integration of some of the Coastal Terminal assets that you own with the Bakken assets as you think about maybe being able to provide services on the loading and unloading side for crude by rail?
Joe Bob Perkins: Brad, you know and others that follow us know that we’re actually we’re working on the Coast Terminal as well before we were working on the Bakken and those projects were getting started beforehand. Now, we find we’re talking to many of the same customers and different groups of the same customers about both handling their supply in the Bakken and handling their linkage to the Coast, East Coast and West Coast. That provides us insights. I don’t want to overwork the synergies other than that but we’re happy to be working with customers on both ends of the pipes so to speak.
Bradley Olsen – Tudor Pickering Holt: Great. And last question for me, we’ve started hearing, I guess, in these quarterly earnings calls from some of the producers in areas like the Eagle Ford and the Permian about perhaps some discounts developing in the condensate market versus the crude oil market. And given the fact that you already have a logistics footprint on the Gulf Coast and already have the logistics that allow you to move exports through your facilities, do you see any potential growth opportunities for Targa if we do see a dislocated Gulf Coast condensate markets to play a role in helping provide liquidity for producers or maybe even provide them with export outlets.
Joe Bob Perkins: Mike was starting to tell me what to say on that one. He knows this better than I do so he’s going to jump in here.
Michael Heim: We are working on two projects right now with both aggregators and producers with initial engineering work being done on condensate stabilizers to make that product more merchantable. It will be out there so that we can use our trucks and potentially use our barges up and down the Texas Gulf Coast between Belvieu and Corpus Christi and other places. It’s a very dynamic situation right now. We certainly want to help the producers make sure that they have a home for their condensate.
Bradley Olsen – Tudor Pickering Holt: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Edwards with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Edwards – Credit Suisse: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Joe Bob Perkins: Hey, John.
John Edwards – Credit Suisse: Hey, I’m just curious on the Badlands, how is that going to be reported? Will that be a separate segment or is it going to go into of your existing segments?
Joe Bob Perkins: It’s going to go into Fields Gathering and Processing segment.
John Edwards – Credit Suisse: Okay. All right. And then, I was just curious on the $250 million of CapEx you identified there, was that already inherent with the acquisition or was that the projects that you immediately identified when you acquired it? And then also, I was just curious, what’s the outlook your expect that too to grow over time?
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay, the $250 million is the same number that we announced when we announced the acquisition based on the work we had done to that point. It’s also very indicative of what we expect to spend in 2013 and if we spend more than that, that’s good news. We have reprioritized those dollars somewhat since we’ve taken ownership 45 days ago but it is a opportunity-rich environment. We are trying to get as much done as quickly as possible for 2013. We will have additional capital expenditures in 2014. I don’t have a number for that for you now but it’s of similar magnitude and probably a little bit less would be a reasonable expectation. And if it’s more it’s a good thing.
John Edwards – Credit Suisse: Okay, that’s great. And then just where are you now for 2013 EBITDA guidance?
Joe Bob Perkins: We did not change our guidance at all.
Matt Meloy: So it was – before we announced the Badlands acquisition, it was $540 million, $570 million, and then we raised that by 10% to 15% which gives you a range of about $600 million to $650 million.
Joe Bob Perkins: Yeah.
John Edwards – Credit Suisse: Okay. All right, great. That’s very helpful. And this last question, in terms of your – the backlog of opportunities that you’re evaluating if you can give us any insight on that.
Joe Bob Perkins: I think the easiest way to describe backlog in – Mike smiles because every time we sort of get in front of people like our investor day, we were talking about projects we hadn’t even planned to talk about. But what is not approved by our Board and that we’re working on looks a whole lot like the suite of projects that are already on our disclosure list. And the two I just mentioned CBF Train 5, people know we’re working on. We’ve put in our investor material and we’ve described publicly. We’ve described that we’re working on unit train projects publicly. And you can assume that we’re also working on in other Gathering and Processing projects.
John Edwards – Credit Suisse: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Michael Blum – Wells Fargo: Thanks. A couple of questions from me. One, can you just talk about across your system if you were ethane in the fourth quarter and now and the extent you’re willing to quantify that.
Joe Bob Perkins: Sure. Let me talk about what we know about ethane rejection. First of all, we have the advantage of sitting at Mont Belvieu and seeing a lot of pipes coming in. So we know that ethane rejection is going on based on decreasing ethane content that we can observe, okay, without pointing to any pipes. We can conclude that that’s certainly occurring in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain. I could also say, you go to our Fields Gathering and Processing plants, SAOU, the Permian plants, North Texas, Targa is not rejecting ethane. So I can’t speak for other parties but, yes, to what extent are we rejecting in our Field Gathering and Processing, we aren’t rejecting at all.
John Edwards – Credit Suisse: Okay. And then turning to hedging for a second. The fact that you’re not hedging the ethane and propane right now, does that imply that your view is that prices will improve this year or conversely that there isn’t a lot of downside. And I guess, the second part of that question is, given the – you mentioned that as the fee-based component of your cash flow is increasing, does that mean that going forward, we should expect this level of hedging as kind of a new kind of steady state?
Joe Bob Perkins: This level of hedging that Matt just described was a mix of the various components and we provide all kinds of disclosure by component on what our hedging looks like. But I think it’s fair to say that at the forward prices, not the current prices, I mean, we’re at $0.25 ethane right now and the forward curve on ethane isn’t very pretty, that we do believe there is more upside than downside relative to the forward price curves, okay? Not relative to current, because that’s what you get to hedge at, the forward price curves.
John Edwards – Credit Suisse: Right.
Joe Bob Perkins: And feel the same way to a certain extent on propane, you’ve got export projects coming on line this year on propane and you didn’t have much of a winner. And that’s just how we view it. And if you think about us running multiple price scenarios, there’s just not a whole lot of downside relative to the upside and we’re going to be less hedged in ethane and propane than we have been in the past. We will probably be more hedged than we are today on the rest of the barrel and on condensate.
John Edwards – Credit Suisse: Okay. That’s helpful. My last question, in the press release, you mentioned that in the fourth quarter there were some I think operational issues at Gulf Coast fractionators, I just wanted, to the extent you could provide any detail there and where that stands today?
Joe Bob Perkins: Well, everyone on the line probably knows that we don’t operate Gulf Coast fractionators and I hate to be the spokesman instead of the operator being the spokesman. What we said in our material is accurate and I know that efforts are continuing. Although, the target is not operation, we are in touch with them and we even try to help provide resources at times [ph].
Michael Blum – Wells Fargo: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Magnum [ph] with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Jeff Magnum [ph] – Robert W. Baird: Good morning, thanks. Our questions have been answered. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Helen Ryoo – Barclays. Your line is open.
Helen Ryoo – Barclays: Yes. Thank you, good morning. Just starting off with the LPG question, I think Joe Bob; you mentioned that the activity was very robust. And the question is before are you pretty max out on your current capacity or should we expect to see the volume, the export activity volume increasing even before the expansion comes online in the third quarter? [Inaudible] should it continue to benefit the Logistics and Marketing business?
Joe Bob Perkins: Okay. Our current activity and results is just what we can export HD5, domestic grade propane prior to this major project that’s coming on. And we’re trying to provide the ability to export as much as possible, working very hard to do that. I would say that the activity and the interest has increased. But we can only get so much across our docs [ph]. And we have been pleasantly surprised by how much we have been able to get across our docs [ph]. And I think it’s reasonable to expect that to continue up into the first phase of the expansion coming on in the third quarter of this year. The third quarter of this year similarly, interest in activity and desire for that has increased. And when it first comes on, we got contracted as much as it can be contracted. And then we will be working to become even more efficient about getting more across the doc [ph], which may open up a little bit more room or room for some spot cargoes. It’s my understanding that the only other doc [ph] in the Gulf Coast doing that has seen similar activity, and desire and demand so to speak.
Helen Ryoo – Barclays: And are you fully contracted out on your 2013 expansion? And also for you ‘14 –
Joe Bob Perkins: Yes.
Helen Ryoo – Barclays: Okay. And then your ‘14 expansion I guess your plan is to still keep, not contract out the whole capacity but keep some for your own account, is that still the plan?
Joe Bob Perkins: No. I remember that coming up I believe in the last call. To clarify it a bit, we’re trying to contract as much as we can based on known ability to meet that demand because those are firm contracts. Our ability to get stuff across the doc [ph] may allow us to get additional spot cargoes beyond what we’ve contracted. When it comes on in ‘13, it’s fully contracted; maybe we can squeeze a little bit more across. And when the additional part comes on in ‘14, it’s essentially contracted. Now, maybe a little bit more that we can contract because we’re learning all the time about what we can get cross the doc [ph]. We also acquired an existing doc [ph] that will require some investment. And we’re looking at plans, different ways to use that doc [ph] to perhaps expand our ability to do LPG contracts. For example, maybe we handle the domestic grade propane out of Patriot while handing more international grade propane out of Galena Park.
Helen Ryoo – Barclays: Okay. And then that was the other question, I guess the Patriot facility is that a site where you could use as an expansion of the LPG export facility? It sounded like it’s maybe used a little bit differently, not best board [ph] –
Joe Bob Perkins: Well, what we said in the release and what I say again today is that it is a very flexible facility because it’s close tires and can be inter-connected with the big facilities are connected to Mt. Belvieu in our grid, in our storage. At the same time we might very well be using it for two purposes. Helping out on the domestic grade propane and what originally hit our radar scope own [ph] was opportunities associated with our petroleum logistics business. And very close location to a major pipeline, yes.
Helen Ryoo – Barclays: Okay, alright, that’s very helpful. And then I guess another question I had was regarding your long horn [ph] plan, is that coming online this year? I’m just wondering I guess it seems like some producers who are [inaudible] activity in the Calumet combo plant [ph], is that affecting maybe your expectation on how quickly this plant will fill up?
Joe Bob Perkins: I think that’s probably fair. It’s left that it’s uneconomic in the Barnett from my perspective, yes, producers who also have Permian opportunity. And that’s just going gang buster. So maybe they’re moving dollars to the Permian in LOU of North Texas for example. I believe you’ve really hit the right summary. It’s still [inaudible] an attractive project for us. It may just fill up slower than we had initially anticipated.
Helen Ryoo – Barclays: Okay. That’s it for me. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darren Horowitz with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Darren Horowitz – Raymond James: Good morning guys. Joe Bob, just one question. As you kind of think about the bid for propane [ph] and around diversions [ph] between our finer [ph] grade supply and polymer [ph] grade demand, how do you guys think about possibly adding some [inaudible] capacity or even looking at PDH in order to meet that demand? I mean, you got as you just mentioned HD5 supply. And it seems like it would be a natural extension of your [inaudible] value can change [inaudible], a little color there would be helpful.
Joe Bob Perkins: We understand that we got a lot on our plate. And it’s unlikely shortly in the near-term that we will be integrating into that direction. Instead what we’ll try to do is meet the needs of customers who are working in that direction. Matt, do you see it any differently [ph]?
Matt Meloy: I mean, there’s a number of PDH plants that have already been announced on the Gulf Coast, may be more to come. And there’s a ton of international project. Our focus is to supply product not to get into that. That is not in our focus line. We don’t have that experience in-house, we’re going to [ph] have to go out and get it.
Darren Horowitz – Raymond James: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Selman Akyol with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.
Selman Akyol – Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks. Good morning. And I appreciate all the color. Two questions for me, first of all in the marketing and distribution segment, you guys referenced the timing of the third party wholesale contract settlement, I was wondering if we could get some additional detail around that so we can get a run rate?
Chris McEwan: We’ve had some additional operating margin periodically, really over the last year. So on the settlement that’s hit [ph] in the second quarter before adhering [ph] Q4. So it can be– (multiple speakers)
Joe Bob Perkins: It’s a settlement if [inaudible] say much more about it. And it’s a good question. I’ll be asking the same question. We’re just stock with what we can say about it.
Chris McEwan: Right.
Selman Akyol – Stifel Nicolaus: All right. Well, fair enough. And then the other question I have is can you just talk a little bit about your appetite for doing other acquisitions, do you have enough or you just prefer to continue on the internal growth or would you be looking for other acquisitions to propel 2014 and beyond?
Joe Bob Perkins: I think our answer is really always the same on that one. We look at a lot of things. We benefit from looking at those things. But on acquisition for target that is accretive, that nicely fits into our existing business and doesn’t overwork our current talent pool, that’s a needle in the haste stock. And we found that with the Badlands acquisition. We hadn’t done in major acquisition for five years when we did that. We did little acquisition that people barely notice that we’re as big as our first acquisition. And the acquisition of the petroleum logistics terminals was a $250 million which was as big as our first acquisition and it barely hit the radar scope. We’ll do smaller ones that will need kind of have a fit. But I don’t see a major acquisition in the future. I could be surprise but it’s not a goal or an objective of ours.
Selman Akyol – Stifel Nicolaus: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: (Operator instructions)
Joe Bob Perkins: I just got corrected, I miss spoke again, I said, 250, I should have said 150, which was approximately the same size as the $250 million SAOU, LOU acquisition.
Operator: And at this time I am showing no additional questions. So I’ll turn it back to management for any closing statements.
Joe Bob Perkins: I just want to say thank you for your time. We appreciate your interest. If you have any follow up questions, please feel free to contact Matt or any of us. Have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference. You all may disconnect and have a good day.

===== 2012 Q3  (2012-11-01 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Targa Resources' Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Joe Brass, Director of Finance. 
Joe Brass: Thank you, operator. I'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter 2012 investor call for both Targa Resources Corp. and Targa Resources Partners LP.
 Before we get started, I would like to mention that Targa Resources Corp., TRC or the Company, and Targa Resources Partners LP, Targa Resources Partners or the Partnership, have published their joint earnings release, which is available on our website, www.targaresources.com. We will also be posting an updated investor presentation to our website after the call.
 Speaking on the call today will be Rene Joyce, Chairman; and Matt Meloy, Chief Financial Officer. Due to a prior travel commitment, Joe Bob Perkins, CEO, will not be speaking with us on the call, but will be available remotely during the Q&A session. Rene and Matt are going to compare the third quarter 2012 results to prior period results as well as providing additional color on our results, business performance and other matters of interest.
 I would like to remind you that any statements made during this call that might include the Company's or the Partnership's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934.
 Please note that actual results may and could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings, included the Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
 With that, I would like to turn it over to Rene Joyce. 
Rene Joyce: Thanks, Joe. Welcome and thanks to everyone for participating in this call. Besides Matt and myself, there are several other members of the management team, who will be available to assist in the Q&A session.
 For today's call, I'll start with a high level review of performance and then highlights. We will then turn it over to Matt to review the Partnership's consolidated financial results, its segment results and other financial matters for the Partnership. Matt will also review key financial matters related to Targa Resources Corp. Following Matt's comments, I'll provide a few more remarks and then we will take your questions.
 But before I get started, I would like to remind listeners that they can assess the presentation and replay of our recent October 18 Investor Day webcast through our website for an even more detailed discussion of our businesses and growth projects. 
 Our reported third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $116 million, an 8% increase over last year, despite weaker commodity prices and the impact of Hurricane Isaac.
 Distributable cash flow of approximately $77 million resulted in distribution coverage of about 1x based on our third quarter declared distribution of $0.6625 or $2.65 on an annual basis. Consistent with our 2012 full year guidance given last fall, the Partnership's third quarter distribution represents a 14% increase compared to the third quarter of 2011.
 Moving to a brief business overview. Despite lower commodity volumes, volumes in our field G&P continue to increase, up over 9% year-over-year, driven by strong producer activity across our systems. Hurricane Isaac impacted our Coastal G&P volumes and operating margin during the quarter.
 We estimate approximately an $8 million impact to EBITDA during the quarter for these operating disruptions, which includes a $3.3 million charge in cleanup and repair cost. 
 The downstream division continued its strong growth profile. Third quarter operating margin increased 53% over 2011. The increase is due to higher fractionation and treating fees, increased LPG export activity and the impact of the 2011 petroleum logistics acquisition.
 That wraps up my initial comments. I'll hand it over to Matt. 
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Rene. I'd like to add my welcome and thank you for joining our call today. Let's start with a review of the consolidated results.
 As Rene mentioned, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $116.2 million compared to our previous guidance of $113 million, and $107.3 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily the result of higher logistics and marketing operating margin and higher commodity hedge settlements, partially offset by lower operating margins in the Gathering and Processing division.
 Overall gross margin increased 3% for the third quarter compared to last year. I will review the drivers of this performance in our segment review. 
 Gross maintenance capital expenditures were $16.2 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared to $24.7 million in 2011. Adjusting for the non-controlling interest portion of maintenance capital expenditures and certain reimbursements from TRC to the Partnership, net maintenance capital expenditures were $12.4 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared to $21.9 million in 2011.
 Turning to the segment level, I'll summarize the third quarter's performance on a year-over-year basis. We'll start with our Gathering and Processing segment. Field Gathering and Processing operating margin decreased by approximately 25% compared to last year, driven by lower natural gas and NGL prices, partially offset by increased throughput. These segment results do not include the impact of our hedging program.
 Third quarter 2012 plant and natural gas inlet for the Field Gathering and Processing segment was 686 million cubic feet per day, a 9% increase compared to the same period in 2011. 
 3 of our 4 our Field Gathering and Processing business units were significantly up in volume. North Texas, SAOU and Sand Hills natural gas inlet volumes increased by approximately 17%, 10% and 11% respectively, with a slight decrease in natural gas inlet volumes at Versado. For the segment, natural gas prices decreased by 36%, while NGL prices decreased 39% and condensate prices increased 1%.
 Turning now to the Coastal Gathering and Processing segment, operating margin decreased 55% in the third quarter compared to last year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower commodity prices and Hurricane Isaac's impact, partially offset by an increase in richer volumes at LOU and the July purchase of the Big Lake plant, now part of the LOU business unit.
 Following Hurricane Isaac, the joint venture owners of Yscloskey, which is an older lower recovery lean oil plant, elected not to repair and restart the plant. The plant contributed less than 1% to the Partnership's operating margin for the first 9 months of 2012, and is not material to the results of our Coastal Gathering and Processing segment. It was only marginally profitable prior to the hurricane and the rebuild, repair costs were not economically justified.
 Next, I'll provide an overview of the 2 segments in the downstream business, starting with the Logistics Asset segment. Third quarter operating margin increased 68% compared to the third quarter 2011, an impressive increase that reflects, among other things, both our growth CapEx and our increased export activity. Growth investments include the Sound Terminal acquisition in October of 2011, and the startup of our benzene treating and depentanizer operations at Mont Belvieu in the first quarter of 2012.
 Export activity at our Galena Park Marine terminal on the Houston ship channel increased again this quarter, with LPG export volumes currently running over 1 million barrels per month, loaded on small-and-medium sized vessels. While operating margin for the Logistic segment was higher versus the previous quarter, you might note slightly lower fractionation volumes versus last quarter. Both the third quarter and the second quarters reflect us being essentially full at Cedar Bayou and moving what we can to our Lake Charles frac or LCF as we call it.
 Prior to the third quarter, receipt volumes at the fractionators were accounted without regard to the source of those volumes. Effective in the third quarter and going forward, volumes received at CBF, but fractionated at LCF, are only reflected at LCF. 
 In the Marketing and Distribution segment, operating margin for the segment increased 29% over the third quarter 2011, due primarily to increased LPG export activity and higher export margins.
 With that, let's now move briefly to a capital -- to discuss capital structure and liquidity. At September 30, we had $280 million of outstanding borrowings under the Partnership's senior secured revolving credit facility. With outstanding letters of credit of $47.4 million, revolver availability was about $773 million at quarter-end.
 Total liquidity, including approximately $89 million of cash on hand, was approximately $861 million, leaving us with ample flexibility to pursue organic growth and acquisition opportunities. Total funded debt on September 30 was approximately $1.7 billion or about 52% of total capitalization, and the Partnership's consolidated leverage ratio at quarter-end was approximately 3.1x, at the low end of our target range of 3x to 4x.
 On October 25, we closed on a private offering of $400 million, 5.25% note due May 2023, issued at 99.5% of par value, resulting in $393.5 million of net proceeds. We used a portion of these proceeds to call in the 8.25% notes. 
 In October, we also refinanced the Partnership's credit facility, increasing the facility size from $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, extending the maturity 5 years and lowering pricing.
 Next, I'd like to make a few comments about our hedging and our capital spending programs for the year. Relative to the Partnership's expected equity volumes from the Field Gathering and Processing segment, we estimate we have hedged approximately 55% of 2012 natural gas and 75% of 2012 combined NGL and condensate. For 2013, we have hedged approximately 45% to 55% of expected 2012 equity volumes for natural gas, NGLs and condensate. And a similar hedging approach is also in the context of significantly increasing levels of fee-based margin.
 Moving on to capital spending. We estimate approximately $680 million of gross capital expenditures in 2012, with approximately $600 million comprising growth capital expenditures. We expect maintenance CapEx net to our interest to be approximately $60 million.
 Next, I will make a few brief remarks about the results of Targa Resources Corp. On October 11, Targa Resources Corp. declared a third quarter cash dividend of $0.4225 per common share or $1.69 per common share on an annualized basis, representing an approximately 37% increase over the annualized rate paid with respect to the third quarter of 2011.
 TRC standalone distributable cash flow for the quarter of $21.9 million resulted in dividend coverage of 1.2x or $17.9 million in total declared dividends for the quarter. TRC stand-alone G&A expenses in the third quarter were $2.2 million.
 In October, we also refinanced the credit facility at TRC, increasing the facility size to $150 million from $75 million. We paid the remaining $88.3 million of outstanding borrowings under the Hold Co. using $75 million under the new revolver and cash on-hand, leaving $75 million undrawn, under the new revolving credit facility.
 Before handing the call back to Rene, I'd like to remind investors that new guidance was provided in the October 17 press release and in our October 18 Investor Presentation. The guidance is summarized on Page 4 of that presentation.
 We pointed to strong growth in 2013, especially in the back half of the year when many of our growth projects come online. This positions us for strong EBITDA growth in 2014 and beyond. Given our outlook for growth, we pointed to 10% to 12% distribution growth in 2013 compared to 2012 for Targa Resources Partners, which would result in an estimated dividend growth of approximately 25% to 30%-plus for Targa Resources Corp. 
 That concludes my review and I'll turn the call back over to Rene. 
Rene Joyce: Thanks, Matt. Just a few final comments; essentially, the executive summary of the October 18 Investor Presentation. The underlying industry dynamics of shale and resource development provide the foundation for Targa's performance and future growth. We have a leadership G&P footprint in multiple basins where volumes are growing. And we're taking advantage of this situation by adding processing capacity in these areas.
 We also have a leading presence in and around Mont Belvieu where fee-based business is growing, and we're adding fractionation storage and export capacity. Multiple projects contribute to our strong growth profile, and we continue to work on additional projects.
 Two project approvals were announced in the press release proceeding, the October Investor Presentation. The first, a $225 million project to install a new $200 million a day cryogenic plant and infrastructure to support our San Angelo system, and add to our strong Permian basin presence. We will call it the High Plains plan. It is well located relative to multiple plays such as the Cline, Canyon Sands, Wolfberry and others, and well located relative to NGL and residue takeaway. The High Plains plan is expected to be completed in mid-2014.
 A second project we announced was to expand our international export project, even before we have completed the first phase of that expansion. The total combined spend will be approximately $480 million. In the third quarter of 2013, we will have the capacity to load 4 VLGCs, in addition to our small- to mid-size LPG export business. By the third quarter of 2014, we will be able to add another 1 million barrels to 2 million barrels a month, or another 2 to 4 VLGCs.
 We expect the impact from these and other highly visible growth projects to provide the margin scale and diversity that will support continued distribution growth, and we continue to work on unannounced -- on the unannounced project portfolio. There are not really any new developments over the last few weeks since our Investor Day on October 18, but the ongoing work includes: Train 5, another 100,000 barrel fractionation facility at Belvieu; other projects in the Permian basin; and the potential for further expansion at our terminals and development of new terminals at other locations, all of which we have previously discussed. 
 And with the benefit of substantial liquidity providing flexibility to expand our diversified midstream platform, the Partnership is positioned to invest in even longer-term growth. 
 So with that, we'll open it up to questions. And now, I'll turn it back to the operator. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] I have a question from Scott Fogleman with Credit Suisse. 
Scott Fogleman: Just a little housekeeping question, just what is the capacity there at Big Lake, the new plant that you all got from Capito [ph]? 
Rene Joyce: Believe it's a little over $200 million a day, it's a $250 million a day plant. 
Scott Fogleman: And I mean you, kind of, touched around it, but what would you say the hurricane impacted the overall throughput at Coastal during the quarter? 
Rene Joyce: It was down for a period of time, kind of, late in the third quarter. When we looked at it reported, we didn't outline the exact volume impact. But we just said it's about -- when you look at the volumes loss, we estimated all-in about an $8 million EBITDA impact. Then you can look, kind of, third quarter to second quarter, the volume's down at both the Coastal Straddle and VESCO, and then how much lower those volumes are Q3 to Q2? 
Joe Brass: Well, essentially all the Gulf shut off. We had volumes impacted at all of our on-shore facilities to varying degrees, but the bulk of the volumes lost was at Venice and Yscloskey. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] I am not showing any other questions in the queue at this time, sir. 
Rene Joyce: Thank you, operator. And to the extent anyone has follow-up questions, please feel free to contact Matt or any of us. Thank you again for your time today, and we look forward to speaking with you again. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2012 Q2  (2012-08-06 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Targa Resources Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
 As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Joe Brass. Sir, you may begin. 
Joe Brass: Thank you, Operator. I'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2012 investor call for both Targa Resources Corp. and Targa Resources Partners LP.
 Before we get started, I would like to mention that Targa Resources Corp., TRC or the company and Targa Resources Partners LP, Targa Resources Partners or the Partnership, have published their joint earnings release, which is available on our website, www.targaresources.com. We will also be posting an updated investor presentation to the website after the call.
 Speaking on the call today will be Joe Bob Perkins, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Meloy, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Joe Bob and Matt are going to be comparing the second quarter 2012 results to prior period results, as well as providing additional color on our results, business performance and other matters of interest.
 I would like to remind you that any statements made during this call that might include the company's or the Partnership's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor's Provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934.
 Please note that actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings, including the Partnership's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
 With that, I’ll turn it over to Joe Bob Perkins. 
Joe Perkins: Thanks, Joe. Good morning, and thanks to everyone for participating. Beside Matt and myself, the several other members of the management team, that will be available to assist in the Q&A session.
 For today’s call, I’ll start-off with a high level review of performance and highlights. We will then turn it over to Matt to review the Partnership’s consolidated financial results, its segment results and other financial matters for the Partnership. Matt will also review key financial matters related to Targa Resources Corp. Following Matt’s comments, I’ll provide a few more remarks and then we’ll take your questions.
 We had a pretty good quarter on most operational and commercial dimensions relative to 2011. On the positive side, Field G&P inlet was up almost 9%, led by significant increases at North Texas and SAOU. Fractionation volumes at CBF and LCF were up, and Marketing and Distribution volumes were also up.
 These positives were offset by couple of factors, Coastal NGL volumes were off primarily due to planned and unplanned maintenance at VESCO and prices were significantly lower for the second quarter of this year, then for the second quarter last year.
 Oil was down about 14% and NGL’s were down about 31%. But Targa benefited from our growth, our fee-based diversification and our hedging program. In that down 14% to 31% pricing environment, EBITDA was only down 5%, coming in at $123 million.
 We noted in the June press release that the Partnership is expected to have excess distribution coverage for 2012 and 2013 based on our continued distribution growth rates, and a commodity price environment that was assuming $2.50 gas, $80 crude and $0.75 average NGL pricing, which included a $0.30 ethane and $0.80 propane assumption.
 Since June, the NGL price environment has improved with ethane currently at about $0.38 per gallon and propane at approximately $0.88 per gallon. Even without this recent price improvement, management believes the Partnership is well-positioned for continued increases in distributions to our unitholders and that ongoing growth CapEx projects provide significant visibility for this outlook.
 Our reported second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $123 million resulted in distributable cash flow of approximately $85 million. Distribution coverage was 1.15x based on our second quarter declared distribution of $64.25 or $2.57 on an annual basis.
 Consistent with our 2012 full year guidance given last fall, the Partnership’s second quarter distribution represents our 13% increase compared to the second quarter of 2011.
 Moving to a brief business overview, of the increase volumes and decrease pricing that I just mentioned, our Field, Gathering and Processing segment reported the second quarter 2012 operating margin decrease of approximately 33%, compared to second quarter 2011. The hedges for Field G&P, which we report as other in our segment information reduced this operating margin decrease to about 15% or only $12 million.
 Second quarter 2012 Coastal G&P segment operating margin decreased approximately 39% over second quarter 2011, primarily due to lower commodity prices and from lower NGL production due to planned and unplanned maintenance at VESCO. This maintenance has now been completed.
 Partially offsetting the decrease was increased volumes of richer wellhead gas processed at LOU resulting from increase onshore Louisiana drilling in the Wilcox. Just as we saw volume improvements in Field G&P, Logistics and Marketing also experienced volume improvements driven by the same industry dynamics.
 The downstream division benefited from increase fractionation volumes due to CBF's Train 3 expansion, which came online mid-year 2011, from increased treating fees due to our benzene project that came online this January, from petroleum logistics terminals acquired in 2011 and from increased LPG export activity, which benefits both our Logistics Assets and our Marketing Distribution segments. With these benefits, second quarter operating margin from our Logistics and Marketing division increased 37% for the second quarter of 2012 over 2011.
 That wraps up my initial review and I'll hand it over to Matt. 
Matthew Meloy: Thanks, Joe Bob. I'd like to add my welcome and thank you for joining our call today. Let's start with a review of the consolidated results. For the second quarter of 2012 the Partnership reported net income of $46.8 million, compared to $55.2 million for the second quarter of 2011. Income for diluted limited partner unit was $0.35 and $0.55, respectively.
 As Joe Bob mentioned, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $122.9 million, compared to $129.8 for the same period last year. The decrease was primarily the result of lower operating margins in the Gathering and Processing division, and in the Marketing and Distribution segment, partially offset by higher Logistics Assets operating margin and by higher commodity hedge settlements.
 Overall, gross margin decreased 2% for the second quarter compared to last year. I will review the drivers of this performance in our segment review.
 Gross maintenance capital expenditures were $15.5 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared to $21.6 million in 2011. Adjusting for the non-controlling interest portion of maintenance capital expenditures from the Partnership, net maintenance capital expenditures were $13 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared to $15.6 million in 2011.
 Turning to the segment level, I’ll summarize the second quarter performance on a year-over-year basis. We’ll start in the Gathering and Processing segments.
 Overall, second quarter 2012 plant natural gas inlet for the Field Gathering and Processing segment was 665 million cubic feet per day, a 9% increase compared to the same period in 2011.
 Field Gathering and Processing operating margin decreased by approximately 33% compared to last year, driven by lower natural gas, NGL and condensate sales prices offset by increase throughput. These segment results do not include the impact of our hedging program.
 North Texas and SAOU natural gas inlet volumes increased by approximately 23% and 12%, respectively, with slight decreases in natural gas inlet volumes at Permian and Versado.
 For the Field natural -- for the Field Gathering and Processing segment, natural gas prices decreased 50% while NGL prices decreased 31% and condensate prices decreased by 12%.
 Turning now to the Coastal Gathering and Processing segment, operating margin decreased 39% in the second quarter compared to last year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower commodity prices and lower throughput volumes due to a decline in offshore supply and outages at VESCO, partially offset by increased inlet and higher liquids content at LOU, largely due to increased wellhead volumes.
 While the overall Coastal G&P segment, growth NGL production decreased 17%. We expect the segment’s growth NGL production for the third quarter to recover from the lower level reported in Q2.
 Next, I’ll provide an overview of the 2 segments in the downstream business. Starting with the Logistics Assets segment, second quarter operating margin increased 37% compared to the second quarter of 2011.
 This impressive increase reflects the strong fee-based growth we are experiencing across our downstream business. Joe Bob will comment on our high-quality growth projects later in the call.
 In the Marketing and Distribution segment, operating margin for the segment decreased 14% over the second quarter of 2011, reflecting a lower price environment, partially offset by increased LPG export activity and higher export margins.
 With that, let’s now move briefly to capital structure and liquidity. At June 30, we had $140 million of outstanding borrowings under the Partnership’s senior secured revolving credit facility with outstanding letters of credit of $70.2 million revolver availability was about $890 million at quarter end.
 Total liquidity including approximately $90 million of cash on hand was approximately $980 million, leaving us with ample flexibility to pursue organic growth and acquisition opportunities.
 Total funded debt at June 30 was approximately $1.5 billion or about 49% of total capitalization and the Partnership’s consolidated leverage ratio at quarter end was approximately 2.9x below our target range of 3 to 4x.
 Next, I'd like to make a few comments about our hedging and capital spending programs for the year. Our hedge percentages are similar to how we hedged in years past, relative to the Partnerships expected equity volumes from our Field G&P segment.
 We estimate that our -- that we have hedged approximately 60% of 2012 natural gas and 75% of 2012 combined NGL and condensate. For 2013, we have hedged approximately 45% to 55% of expected 2012 equity volumes for natural gas, NGL’s and condensate.
 Moving on to capital spending, we estimate on a net basis approximately $650 million of capital expenditures in 2012 with approximately 12% of the total comprising maintenance capital spending.
 Before we move on to TRC discussion, I’d like to discuss our previous estimated EBITDA guidance for 2012. First, as a reminder, we plan to provide financial guidance on an annual basis and do not intend to adjust our previous annual guidance on a quarterly basis. We have provided and may provide on occasion additional updates if conditions warrant.
 For example, we initially provided 2012 EBITDA guidance in the fourth quarter of 2011. That was based on $85 a barrel for crude, $4 an MMBtu for natural gas and an average NGL price of $1.30 per gallon, which included ethane at $0.75 per gallon
 Then, in the first quarter of 2012, as NGL prices fell significantly, we stated that our EBITDA range remained unchanged for 2012 and that we were still comfortable with a midpoint of approximately $530 million, which assumed ethane prices at $0.50 a gallon, with crude still at $85 a barrel and natural gas still at $4 an MMBtu.
 As commodity prices continue to decline and into the second quarter, we provided some additional information regarding coverage ratios in June under then current commodity prices.
 Assuming $80 a barrel for crude, $2.50 an MMBtu for natural gas and $0.75 a gallon per NGLs, which included a $0.30 a gallon for ethane, we estimate the Partnership will have excess coverage while continuing its distribution growth. So we do not see a need for any further update to our guidance at this time. Going forward, we expect to provide our annual financial guidance for 2013 sometime in the fourth quarter of this year.
 Before handing the call back to Joe Bob, I’d like to make some brief remarks about the results of Targa Resources Corp. On July 11, TRC declared a first quarter cash dividend of $39.375 per common share or a $1.575 per common share on an annualized basis, representing an approximately 36% increase over the annualized rate paid with respect to the second quarter of 2011.
 TRC's standalone distributable cash flow for the second quarter of $17.3 million resulted in dividend coverage of just over 1x the $16.7 million in total dividends declared for the quarter. TRC standalone general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were $2.2 million.
 At June 30, the balance of the TRC Hold Co. loan, due 2015, was unchanged at $89.3 million and there were no borrowings under the $75 million senior secured revolving credit facility. At June 30, TRC had a cash balance of approximately $28 million, which gives total liquidity of approximately $103 million.
 That concludes my review. So I’ll now turn the call over to Joe Bob. 
Joe Perkins: Thanks, Matt. I’ll just make a few final comments. As previously mentioned, producer activity in North Texas and the Permian basin is increasing volumes. As you probably know, we will install an additional 60 million cubic feet per day of processing in the Permian Basin by the end of the year and expect that additional capacity to soon be fully utilized, and we are currently evaluating other Permian Basin plan additions.
 Similarly, with the North Texas capacity filling up, we’re glad that the 200 million cubic feet a day, Longhorn plant is in progress and expected mid-2013. On the downstream side, our CBF Train 4 construction continues and is expected to startup in the second quarter 2013. And we have previously mentioned, this capacity is fully contracted for term with high levels of frac-or-pay commitments.
 Our $250 million international grade propane export project, which adds facilities both at our Galena Park Marine export-import terminal and at our Mont Belvieu complex to provide for the export of low ethane propane, is scheduled to be operational in the third quarter of 2013. The project is fully contracted.
 We are currently executing growth projects and pursuing additional contracts and growth capital investments at each of our 3 petroleum logistics terminals, while continuing to work on additional petroleum logistics project development and acquisition opportunities.
 So as the Partnerships financial results and these organic growth projects indicate, our diverse set of assets performed pretty well in the second quarter and are providing us very interesting opportunities for the future.
 We expect the impact from our highly visible growth projects, which are primarily fee-based to provide the margins, scale and diversity that will support continued distribution growth even in the current price environment.
 And with the benefit of substantial liquidity providing flexibility to expand our diversified mid-stream platform, the Partnership is positioned to invest in even longer-term growth.
 So in summary, assets performing well, highly visible primarily fee-based projects providing margin, scale and diversity supporting continued distribution growth and well-positioned to expand and invest in even longer-term growth. That is why we feel good about the guidance and updates that have been provided to you previously.
 Matt reminded all of us on this call about the additional information provided to our annual guidance back in February. We are comfortable with that update at those prices. Matt reminded us also about our June update on 2012 and 2013 coverages, at a price stack that is lower than the first half of the year and lower than current prices. We are still comfortable with that update at those prices. And he said, we do not see the need for further updates on this subject at this time.
 So, with that, we'll open it up to questions. I'll turn it back to you operator. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Darren Horowitz with Raymond James. 
Darren Horowitz: Joe Bob, as it relates to your comments around Permian growth, in order to keep pace with Avalon and Bone Springs production. Do you think that producer demand could support maybe another 2 or 3 processing plant additions and maybe an aggregate somewhere on the order of another 200,000 to 250,000 MMcf a day capacity? 
Joe Perkins: I think those numbers would be reasonable for just Targa and I don’t think you asked - or were you’re asking just Targa across the industry, Darren? 
Darren Horowitz: I was just asking just Targa. 
Joe Perkins: Yes. That’s very possible. 
Darren Horowitz: Okay. In terms of lead time, as you guys are thinking about it. Is it fair to assume somewhere around maybe 18 months as soon as you get the green light and maybe from your perspective, if the scale that I just outlined is correct, aggregate cost somewhere around $250 million or $300 million? 
Joe Perkins: The timeline is approximately correct. $250 million to $300 million depends on what sort of capacity we’re putting in place. But the numbers you, sort of, ranged earlier are -- you were little too high for the range, I heard. If you want to repeat it, we can check it. 
Darren Horowitz: That’s okay. Shifting to the propane export project, based on what you’re seeing out there from a supply-demand perspective. Would it be possible for you to contemplate maybe another expansion and when you look at the existing scale of your project, for some incremental CapEx, is it possible to load a few more ships, maybe pick up another million barrels of export capacity? 
Michael Heim: This is Mike Heim. We are already working on a duplication of what we have already announced. And even without that, we can kind of shoehorn in an extra load here and there. But the basis on under which we define the project has been fully marketed. So we’re moving forward onto the next piece. 
Joe Perkins: With a lot of interest. 
Michael Heim: Yes. And its way down the road. 
Darren Horowitz: Okay. Last question from me, Joe Bob, if you could, from a demand perspective, just give us some color on whether or not, you’re close to the go ahead on CBF Train 5? 
Joe Perkins: No, I probably won’t tell you about that but we are having ongoing discussions. We’ve got room for -- the permits are in process. Most of the engineering is well along the way and when we’re ready to announce it, you’ll be the first to know. 
Operator: Our next question is from Gabe Moreen with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. 
Gabriel Moreen: Couple of questions on the Marketing and Distribution side of things. On the short-term distribution opportunities, which you cited from supply and market conditions. Just wondering if we can get more color on that, is that related to the export activity that was mentioned in the Marketing and Distribution side of things or is that something else? 
Joe Perkins: Well, to your question, there are short-term opportunities both with respect to the exports where we’ve had few more spot cargos here and there. Some -- just watch public reports, you will see sometimes we squeeze in more than we tell people we can.  Onshore, we have a very talented Logistics group and we’ll find short-term opportunities to help people with supply demand. 
Gabriel Moreen: And was any of that short-term opportunity related to tight frac capacity in the second quarter or is -- even if that was the case, would that show up in that segment too? 
Joe Perkins: No, wouldn’t show up. Not much would show up in that segment. We do have sort of ancillary fees associated with our fractionation, but that’s not what we were referring to. 
Gabriel Moreen: Okay. And I guess, did you realize any upside from the tight frac capacity in the second quarter or…. 
Joe Perkins: Yes. 
Gabriel Moreen: Okay. And then last question on the Marketing and Distribution segment, also about that multi-year propane exchange agreement, just wondering if there is any color in terms of settlements to that contract going forward in future payments. How that might shake out over the rest of the year or in 2013, ‘14? 
Joe Perkins: No. I don’t have a comment on that. 
Operator: Our next question is from T.J. Schultz with RBC Capital Markets. 
TJ Schultz: Just in field G&P, can you just expand on the comment in the press release that volumes were impacted by pipeline curtailments and what you’re seeing there and also the nature of some of the operational issues and if any of that may spill into the back half of this year? 
Joe Perkins: There were some operational issues in the quarter with natural gas liquids pipelines in particular. Those repairs and planned maintenance for the most part hopefully are behind us. 
Matthew Meloy: And those were all third party. Those were not… 
Joe Perkins: Yes. 
TJ Schultz: Okay. In the LOU segment or at LOU, you mentioned volumes were benefiting from the Wilcox. Can you just expand on current producer activity focused on the Wilcox now and maybe you latest thoughts on the Tuscaloosa? 
Joe Perkins: The Wilcox activity continues to increase and we benefit from -- I mean, we capture our fair share of Wilcox wells and it’s very meaningful when that rich production is added to the LOU business mix. The Tuscaloosa marine shale, I’m not sure that my comments were particularly helpful but from what I read and what I hear from producers, I’m cautiously optimistic. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Etham Bellamy with Baird. 
Ethan Bellamy: One quick one, beyond enterprise, have you caught wind of any other competitor sniffing around the propane export market? 
Matthew Meloy: Sure. Everybody has got an idea about an export project, but they are very, very expensive where you can get to the water. It's densely populated or has heavy industrial development. So the pipes to a dock -- docks are easy, docks are cheap. But the pipe is the most important thing and then on top of all that, you got to have the right storage.  And the most important thing is you have to have low ethane propane. And if you don't have it, you're just wasting your time. 
Operator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Joe Bob Perkins for closing remarks. 
Joe Perkins: Thank you, Operator and thank you everybody for you interest and questions. To the extent, if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to give Matt a call or contact any of us. Thank you again for your time today. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-05-03 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Targa Resources First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we’ll conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Joe Brass, Director of Finance. Please go ahead. 
Joe Brass: Thank you, operator. I’d like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2012 investor call for both Targa Resources Corp. and Targa Resources Partners L.P.
 Before we get started, I would like to mention that Targa Resources Corp. TRC or the company and Targa Resources Partners LP, Targa Resources Partners or the Partnership, have published their joint earnings release, which is available on our website www.targaresources.com. We will also be posting an updated investor presentation to the website after the call.
 Speaking on today’s call would be Joe Bob Perkins, Chief Executive Officer, Matt Meloy, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Joe Bob and Matt are going to compare our first quarter 2012 results to prior period results as well as providing additional color on our results, business performance and other matters of interest.
 I would like to remind you that any statements made during this call that might include the Company’s or the Partnership’s expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbors provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Please note that actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.
 For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings including the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
 With that, I will turn it over to Joe Bob Perkins. 
Joe Perkins: Thanks, Joe. Welcome and thanks to everyone for participating. Besides Matt and myself, there are several other members of management who will be available to assist with Q&A.
 For today’s agenda, not unlike previous calls, I’ll start off with a high-level review of performance, key accomplishments and business highlights for the quarter. We’ll then turn it over to Matt to review the Partnership’s consolidated financial results, segment results and other financial matters for the partnership. Matt will also review key financial matters related to Targa Resources Corp. Following Matt’s comments, I’ll provide an additional update on some of our ongoing activities, and we’ll take your questions at the end.
 We’re off to a great start in 2012 with strong operating and financial results for the first quarter and with solid performance across almost all aspects of both our Gathering & Processing and our Logistics and Marketing divisions. As we execute our growth strategy, the Partnership’s diverse midstream platform continues to benefit from strong industry fundamentals. And that same platform provides an exciting inventory of announced and potential growth projects.
 We reported first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $145 million, which resulted in distributable cash flow of approximately $106 million. Distribution coverage was 1.5x based on our first quarter declared distribution of $0.6225 per quarter or $2.49 on an annual basis. The Partnership’s first quarter distribution represents a 12% increase compared to the first quarter 2011.
 Moving to the business highlights for our Gathering & Processing division, first quarter operating margin for the division increased 22% over last year. In almost every case, business unit plant inlet and NGL production were up over this quarter last year only exception was Coastal Straddles were inlet was down, but NGL production was up.
 The Field G&P segment reported a first quarter 2012 operating margin increase of approximately 20% compared to the first quarter 2011. This increase was the result of increased volumes in all of our Field G&P business units North Texas, SAOU, Sand Hills, and Versado.
 Volume increases driven by very active drilling and production activity. Inlet and gross NGL production for the segment both increased about 14% over first quarter 2011. These increasing Field G&P volumes are primarily from very active and growing resource plays some with years of remaining locations.
 For example, the Wolfberry oil wells in the case of SAOU, Wolfberry and Bone Springs oil wells for Sand Hills and high liquid gas wells from the oily part of the Barnett in North Texas.
 Also, if you recall, last year at this time, we had a normally cold weather. This year the mild weather benefited our field operations. First quarter 2012 Coastal G&P operating margins increased approximately 28% over first quarter 2011.
 The increase was primarily attributable to increased gas purchase for processing at VESCO, higher system liquid content at LOU due to wellhead volume increases we’ve talked about before, continued optimization of throughput and favorable frac spread.
 Our coastal assets are well positioned for future growth opportunities as well. Well positioned as we see permitting activity in the Gulf of Mexico return to normal. As we see onshore activity heat up in the Wilcox and Austin Chalk. And as we begin to learn more about early indications for the Tuscaloosa Marine shale, sometimes referred to as a TMS or Louisiana Eagle Ford.
 The ongoing industry dynamics, which are increasing NGL production from Targa and other companies Gathering & Processing facilities, also increased volumes and activity downstream, an increased demand for incremental NGL infrastructure, which benefits our Logistics & Marketing division.
 For the first quarter, operating margin from our Logistics & Marketing division increased 26% over the first quarter of 2011. While operating margin in the distribution and marketing segment was down versus 2011, the segment really performed quite well given weaker price environment and the low heating demand caused by a warmer than average winter.
 The logistics asset segment benefited from increased fractionation volumes primarily due to CBF’s Train 3 Expansion increased treating fees due to our Benzene project coming online in January and to some extent from Petroleum Logistics terminals and increased LPG Export activity versus this quarter last year.
 That wraps up my initial review and I’ll hand it over to Matt. 
Matt Meloy: Thanks, Joe Bob. I’d like to add my welcome and thank you for joining our call today. Let’s start with the review of the consolidated results. For the first quarter of 2012, the Partnership reported net income of $70.1 million compared to $37.8 million for the first quarter of 2011.
 The income per diluted limited partner unit was $0.63 and $0.37 respectively. As Joe Bob mentioned, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $145.4 million significantly above the $107.4 million for the same period last year.
 The increase was primarily the result of higher operating margins across the Gathering & Processing division and in the Logistics assets segment, partially offset by lower marketing and distribution operating margin.
 Overall gross margin increased 22% for the first quarter compared to last year. Again, strong performance across those divisions drove the gross margin improvement. And I will review the drivers of this performance in our segment review.
 Growth maintenance capital expenditures were $16.5 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $12.8 million in 2011. Adjusting for the non-controlling interest portion of maintenance CapEx and certain reimbursements from TRC to the partnership, net maintenance capital expenditures were $14.3 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $8.2 million in 2011.
 Before we move to segment performance, let me touch on one more item, as we explained last year when we rolled out our 2012 guidance, we plan on providing guidance on an annual basis. So we are not modifying our 2012 guidance at this time. However, there are a few items I would like to point out for you to consider for the second quarter.
 The first quarter benefited from positive items that may not occur every quarter such as system gains and contract settlements. In addition, there are some planned outages that will affect VESCO and GCF in the second quarter. Finally as you’re all well aware, NGL pricing is weaker so far this quarter.
 Turning to the segment level, I’ll summarize the first quarter’s performance on a year-over-year basis for all segments and then I’ll summarize the performance on a sequential basis.
 We’ll start in our Gathering & Processing segment. Overall first quarter 2012, plant natural gas inlet for the Field Gathering & Processing segment was 655 million cubic feet per day, a 14% increase compared to the same period in 2011. Field Gathering & Processing operating margin increased by approximately 20% compared to last year driven by increased throughput volumes and higher condensate prices offset by lower natural gas and NGL sales prices.
 All systems had higher volumes compared to last year, North Texas, SAOU, Sand Hills and Versado natural gas inlet increased by approximately 22%, 8%, 19%, and 7% respectively. Activity continues in the oilier portions of the Barnett Shale and in the multi-zone oil plays now largely resource plays in the Permian Basin.
 For the Field Gathering & Processing segment natural gas prices decreased by 32%, while NGL prices decreased 5% and condensate prices were 9% higher.
 Turning now to the Coastal Gathering & Processing segment. Operating margin increased 28% in the first quarter compared to last year. The increase was primarily driven by more gas purchase for processing at VESCO and other Coastal Straddles and increased inlet and higher liquids content at LOU, largely due to increased wellhead volumes.
 While the overall Coastal G&P segment inlet natural gas volumes decreased 1%, inlet volumes at both VESCO and LOU increased 13% when compared to first quarter 2011. As we have discussed, NGL production is more meaningful than inlet volumes for Coastal G&P and relative to other Coastal G&P volumes, LOU wellhead and certain new VESCO volumes are richer in NGL content. As a result, NGL production for the Coastal segment increased 7% in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to last year.
 Next I’ll provide an overview of the 2 segments and the downstream business. Starting with the logistics assets segment, first quarter operating margin increased 93% compared to the first quarter 2011. This impressive increase which is predominantly fee-based was driven by increased throughput volumes at CBF due to the Train 3 Expansion, increased treating volumes due to the start-up of the Benzene unit and by the new contributions from the Petroleum Logistics terminals.
 In the marketing and distribution segment, NGL sales volumes for the quarter stayed relatively flat compared to 2011. And operating margin for the segment decreased 20% over the first quarter 2011 driven by a weaker price environment and less favorable marketing margins as a result of lower heating demand.
 With that review of Q1 results, now let’s discuss the few key sequential comparisons for the first quarter of 2012. First quarter operating margin for the Field G&P segment decreased 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. The decrease was primarily the result of significantly lower gas and NGL prices offset by a 4% increase in inlet volumes.
 Moving to the Coastal Gathering & Processing segment, operating margin for the segment decreased 12% compared to the previous quarter. The operating margin decline was driven primarily by lower NGL prices.
 Turning now to the downstream business. In the logistics assets segment, operating margin increased 15% sequentially, due primarily to system gains and the startup of our Benzene treating facility. Fractionation volumes for the first quarter 2012 were relatively flat compared to the previous quarter. The marketing and distribution segment, operating margin decreased 15% compared to the previous quarter due primarily to a weaker price environment into a warm winter.
 With that, let’s now move briefly to capital structure and liquidity.
 On March 31st, we had no outstanding borrowings under the partnership’s senior secured revolving credit facility. With outstanding letters of credit of $77.6 million, revolver availability was over $1 billion at quarter end. Total liquidity including $88 million of cash on hand was approximately $1.1 billion leaving us with ample flexibility to pursue organic growth and acquisition opportunities.
 Total funded debt on March 31st was approximately $1.4 billion or about 47% of total capitalization and the Partnership’s consolidated leverage ratio at quarter end was approximately 2.6x below our target range of 3x to 4x.
 We had a busy and productive start to 2012 financing in January with 2 capital markets transactions resulting in $565 million of new capital raised, which essentially financed our announced growth CapEx program for the year.
 Next I’d like to make a few comments about our hedging and capital spending programs for the year. Our hedge percentages including hedges added in April are similar to how we hedged in years past. Relative to the partnership’s expected equity volumes from our fuel G&P, we estimate that we have hedged approximately 60% of 2012 natural gas and 80% of 2012 combined NGL and condensate. For 2013, we have hedged approximately 45 to 55 of expected 2012 equity volumes for natural gas, NGLs and condensate.
 Moving on to capital spending, we estimate on a net basis approximately $650 million of capital expenditures in 2012 with approximately 12% of the total comprising maintenance capital spending. The estimate does not include our share of investment related to our minority 38.8% ownership in the expansion of Gulf Coast Fractionators.
 Before handing the call back to Joe Bob, I would like to make some brief remarks about the results of Targa Resources Corp. On April 11th, TRC declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.365 per common share or $1.46 per common share on an annualized basis representing an approximately 34% increase over the annualized rate paid with respect to the first quarter of 2011.
 TRC standalone distributable cash flow for the first quarter came in at $14.4 million which was approximately $1 million lower than total dividends. We expect DCF to fully cover dividends for full year 2012. TRC standalone G&A expenses in the first quarter were $2 million. We expect a similar amount of G&A expense in the second quarter.
 At March 31st, TRC had a cash balance of approximately $35 million which gives total liquidity of approximately $110 million. At March 31st, the balance of the TRC Holdco loans due 2015 was unchanged at $89.3 million and there were no borrowings under the $75 million senior secured revolving credit facility.
 That concludes my review. So I’ll turn the call back over to Joe Bob. 
Joe Perkins: Thanks, Matt. To wrap up our prepared remarks, I’m going to provide a few highlights of ongoing projects. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we announced a North Texas Longhorn project in response to increased production, significant producer activity and expected increases in inlet gas and NGL volumes in the liquid rich area of the Barnett Shale that we serve.
 This 200 million cubic feet a day cryogenic gas processing plant project is estimated to cost approximately $150 million and is backed by significant new acreage dedications. With much of the equipment ordered in offsite work underway, it’s expected to be on line mid 2013 or perhaps later depending on the uncertain timing of the new EPA permit approval process.
 In addition to the Longhorn Project, other North Texas expansion activity continues. With activity levels and growth capital investment expected to be similar to 2011, as activity continues in the area and Targa attempts to meet the growing needs of our producer customers.
 In the Permian Basin, we are experiencing continued producer activity, active leasing, active vertical and horizontal drilling and increasing producer knowledge of how to exploit the multiple stacked oil plays of the Basin. The Spraberry/Dean/Wolfcamp/Cline AKA Wolfberry in the Avalon/Bone Springs are impacting our facilities.
 This activity significant new acreage dedications and increasing volumes at both SAOU and Sand Hills have already resulted in 30 million cubic foot a day plant expansion projects at both locations. Both are approved and underway for a total incremental capacity of 60 million cubic feet a day, new processing capacity that will be in place by the end of this year and we see additional expansion expected in the future.
 The Benzene Treating project is now online and providing additional fee-based margins with term user pay contract arrangements. Construction continues on our $360 million fee-based 100,000 barrel a day Train 4 Expansion at CBF. And it is scheduled for a second quarter 2013 start up. As we have previously mentioned, this capacity is fully contracted for term with high levels of frac-or-pay commitments.
 Furthermore, we are seeing a high level of customer interest for additional Targa fractionation capacity, significant demand for a new 100,000 barrel a day Train 5. The engineering fee study will be completed in mid May and permits have been submitted.
 Our approximately $250 million international grade propane export project where we are adding facilities at both our Galena Park marine export/import terminal in our Mont Belvieu complex to provide for the export of low ethane propane is expected to be operational by the third quarter of 2013.
 We have had tremendous response from the international market since we announced the project. Even though the facility will not be operational until 2013, we already have multiyear user pay commercial contracts in place for a substantial piece of our new international propane export capability.
 We’re currently executing growth projects and pursuing additional growth capital investments in each of our 3 Petroleum Logistics terminals. And as we’ve said before, we plan to continue our terminal acquisition and development strategy.
 In conclusion, we are very pleased to see first quarter results continue the strong 2011 year-end increases for both of our divisions. These results clearly illustrate the success we are seeing across our diverse asset base.
 We’re confident in the continued underlying industry fundamentals that support growth across our diverse midstream platform. And as mentioned earlier, we have over $1 billion in announced growth projects coming online throughout 2012 and 2013 adding to our scale and diversity.
 These are attractive projects with attractive returns, attractive multiples to EBITDA and they provide a high degree of visibility on incremental fee-based business and on our future financial performance. And we’re continuing to develop high-quality projects I alluded to some of them a little bit ago that were in response to customer demand for quality well run midstream infrastructure.
 The partnership has a very good track record of delivering on strong growth. And with our $1 billion of liquidity, 2.6x leverage ratio, strong distribution coverage providing additional growth capital, the Partnership is well positioned for future growth.
 As we previously pointed out with our January financings completed, we’ve essentially funded all of the announced projects. Again we’re very proud of our 2012 first quarter results and proud of all the Targa employees that made it possible.
 Operator, now we’re ready to take any follow-up questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Darren Horowitz from Raymond James. 
Darren Horowitz: Joe Bob, beyond the 60 million of plant expansions that you mentioned at SAOU and Sand Hills, based on the discussions that guys you are having with producers, can you give us a little bit more color on what you think the future expansions across those systems could look like? 
Joe Perkins: We see scales larger than that readily available 30 million a day at each location. We’re working with producers on that, studying the right size and looking for contractual arrangements. 
Darren Horowitz: Okay. Shifting over to the propane export facility, can you just remind us on a barrels per month basis what the capacity that’s going to be and if you could give us a little bit more detail as the amount of that capacity that’s booked on those multiyear contracts you said that would be helpful? 
Joe Perkins: It would be helpful. I don’t attempt to say more about the contractual arrangements than what we said in our prepared remarks. But I will remind you of what we said about the capacity of the facility, it’s up to 4 of the very large ships and you can quantify the ships as averaging about 550,000 barrels -- 540,000 to 550,000 barrels per ship -- per month. 
Darren Horowitz: Okay. So loading capacity should be about 5,000 barrels an hour more or less? 
Joe Perkins: The 5,000 barrels an hour is important in that overall capacity situation as is the dock situation in getting ships in and out. It’s for us on our capability being up, up to 4 of those large ships per month. 
Darren Horowitz: Last question from me. Can you just share your thoughts as it relates to the propane markets as it sits today? Obviously we’ve got a lot of in inventory. Inventory seasonally built about 1 million barrels a week through October that’s obviously putting a lot pressure on propane and there’s a pretty big arb [ph] going on, certainly it swings seasonally. Do you think that the capacity you’re adding as well as some of your competitors is going to be enough to help balance that supply demand? 
Joe Perkins: I think that export capacity is needed. I think the demand we’re seeing says it will be pretty fully utilized. And I believe that it does help pricing. My pricing crystal ball isn’t any better than anyone else’s out there and I think we will see a lot more about propane pricing come this second half of the year and as we go through next winter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. 
Michael Blum: Just a couple of quick questions from me. One, in terms of this fracturing side that you’re talking about, will this also be frac-or-pay contracts and what percent of that capacity do you need to have signed up to move ahead completely? 
Joe Perkins: I would anticipate that the contracts would look very similar to the most recently contracted. I don’t have a measured percentage that I was going to -- would announce on this call on to how much would be full before we announced it. In the past, we’ve announced projects after we had some commitments and then they quickly filled up. 
Michael Blum: Okay. Let me ask that in a different way. Do you expect this one to also ultimately be a 100% contracted based on the demand? 
Joe Perkins: Well I would expect that ultimately it would be a 100% contracted, yes. The demand is very large. 
Michael Blum: Okay. And then in terms of your refined product terminal initiatives that you undertook probably under a year ago, where does that stand and any update there? 
Joe Perkins: You’re breaking up just a little bit, Mike, or it’s my hearing and probably a combination of both. Please repeat the question. 
Michael Blum: Sure, sorry. Refined products -- your refines product storage initially that you undertook. 
Joe Perkins: Yes. 
Michael Blum: Can you just provide an update of where that business stands, where that initiative stands? 
Joe Perkins: We announced in May 3 acquisitions. We are improving them commercially as well as adding physical capability at all 3. And we’re continuing to pursue additional acquisition or development opportunities. 
Operator: Our next question comes from James Jampel from HITE. 
James Jampel: Just one quick question. How should we think about cash taxes going forward at the C Corp? 
Matt Meloy: Sure. We estimated earlier or actually late last year about a 20% effective tax rate on pre-tax distributable cash flow at TRC and we haven’t updated that range. So 20% of the pre-tax DCF is our estimate for cash tax list for 2012. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Louis Shamie from Zimmer Lucas. 
Louis Shamie: Just had a little bit of I guess more of a granular question about the Field G&P results this quarter. Looks like the gross margin was pretty comparable to Q4 and your NGL volumes were pretty comparable to Q4, but NGL realized prices were like $1.06 versus $1.27. Just wondering if there’s anything in there that did your contracts change or anything happened to kind of benefit you in that segment this quarter? 
Matt Meloy: No. I don’t think there was anything structurally with our contracts that changed as a weaker NGL price environment but similar average contract terms from Q4 to Q1. 
Operator: Our next question comes from TJ Schultz from RBC Capital Markets. 
TJ Schultz: I guess just following up on Michael’s last question on the SAOU internal. I guess looking for a little more color on the $60 million and spend you’re having there and kind of what capabilities you’re looking to build out here. As the goal I guess given the high crude activity we’re seeing obviously to increase your crude oil capabilities here and then as we continue to see high demand for these types of services, do you think there is additional investment opportunities around these assets above that $60 million? 
Joe Perkins: This is my time. Basically, we’ve got capital programs going on at all 3 terminals. We, out in Tacoma, we are in the process of building a connection to the Olympic pipeline. We are also working on unit train capability out there. We’ve got ongoing discussions with producers that have bottled up condensate and oil that can be moved by rail to the West Coast. We’re also doing the exact same thing in Baltimore. The primary thing that we’re doing in Channelview is we’re adding new storage tanks, we’ve leased acreage next door to us on a long-term contract. We’re going to add a substantial amount of storage there and we’re working on the connection to the deepwater port so that we can both import and export both crude oil and fuel oil. 
Matt Meloy: And as we said in the past particularly in this area that was capital projects were preceded by commercial agreements. 
TJ Schultz: I guess just moving on kind of bigger picture on Gulf of Mexico activity. I know you’ve mentioned you expect permit activity kind of back to normal by the end of 2012. Just kind of curious how this timing translates to volumes from your perspective I guess asking really. How quickly do you anticipate producers being to get supply to shore to show to more of a noticeable impact for you? 
Joe Perkins: Recent indications are that permitting activity actually made the exceeding what were previous normals or averages, probably a function of bottled up demand for that. So permitting the activity is the leading indicator as above average and technology in the place that they’re working on would say that production time to shore will be shorter than it had been in the past much shorter in some cases and we’ll just have to wait and see. 
TJ Schultz: Okay. Fair enough. I guess just lastly a little bit more granular, in the logistics segment, can you tell me what amount of the sequential uptick in margin there was due to the Benzene Treating? 
Joe Perkins: I don’t have -- I don’t look at the sequential nearly as much as you’ll do. I don’t have that now. 
Matt Meloy: No, we haven’t broken out our projects within our CapEx program on an EBITDA by project basis in the past. 
Joe Perkins: And that was a partial quarter result as it did not come on until January, in January. 
TJ Schultz: Good point. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Fogleman from Credit Suisse. 
Scott Fogleman: I just have a quick question. What sort of opportunity backlog are you seeing with the propane facility and other companies reporting – their phones are ringing off the hook and we’re curious if you’re having the same problem. 
Joe Perkins: Opportunity backlog on the propane facility, we’ve got very high demand for that facility well ahead of it being completed if that’s what you mean to the point that I think the term I used was a substantial portion of its already contracted. 
Scott Fogleman: Okay. And by substantial, does that mean greater than 50%? 
Joe Perkins: No I used that word substantial on purpose and I’m not going to take it. 
Matt Meloy: Let me say one thing about that. We -- the way we announced the project, the way we went into construction was to get it going not because it’s going to be our ultimate result and we are looking at expansion of that project right now. 
Joe Perkins: Yes, in other words increasing the capabilities that we previously announced, we are looking at that. 
Matt Meloy: And I think there also will be opportunities for supplying propane for proposed propane dehydrogenation units on the Gulf Coast. So, we I think there is a high probability we’ll be expanding Belvieu and Galena Park facilities for both activities. 
Scott Fogleman: Okay. Let me rephrase what I was getting at early as far as opportunities. The unannounced project backlog, I mean, you just mentioned you could very likely expand your propane facility. If you had to could you put a dollar figure on… 
Joe Perkins: No, not prepared to do that. 
Scott Fogleman: Not prepared to do that. Fair enough. That’s all I have. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Walter Kass [ph] from Kingfisher [ph]. 
Unknown Analyst: Mr. Perkins. I have a top down question and that is let’s say distribution reinvestment, excuse me, dividend reinvestment plan is possible at TRGP. What would be advantages and disadvantages be to both TRGP and shareholders? 
Joe Perkins: We’ve looked at dividend or distribution a bit in the past participation is generally pretty low for those programs, but it’s something we’ll continue to evaluate over time and if we think it make sense we’ll consider it. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. 
Jeremy Tonet: It seems like Targa has quite a robust organic growth program over the next couple of years. I was just wondering if you could comment on the Partnership’s appetite for acquisitions that could potentially create new platforms and set up new opportunities for a longer dated growth. 
Joe Perkins: I almost put in a bullet point, because we always get this question and I guess that I can replay on the same answer. We’re always looking -- we’ve got appetite. We probably participated in as many in the first part of this year as we did the first part of last year and when we have one to announce, we’ll let you know about it, but we so far don’t have any acquisitions to announce. 
Operator: I’m showing no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Joe Bob Perkins. 
Joe Perkins: Thanks, operator. If you have any other follow-up questions and feel free to contact Matt or any of us. And we thank you again for your time and interest. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today’s conference. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.
